Coming up in the next hour, Kathleen, we'll be talking age and market strategy, taking a closer look at Korea, where you are today, of course, invests going to Japan, Morgan joining us. Plus, as leaders of two Malaysian coalitions say they have the numbers to form the next government, we'll take a look at what's next ahead of that 2pm deadline. The Pacific Research Centre will be joining us with analysis. In the meantime, the market opens at almost upon us in Seoul and Tokyo, this is Bloomberg. What do you think of when you think of a battery? For most, it's what we use to power devices for both work and play, and maybe even your car. Over the past few decades, they've got a lot of power. But all of this is just a prologue to what the next batteries are going to do. As we drive to an increasingly renewable power-driven grid, we also need to be able to store energy and release it later to cover those periods of weather intermittencies that are driving this new grid that we're in. It's a multi-trillion dollar opportunity, and it's imperative that we figure out the solution here. How we store energy on a massive scale is in many ways the central challenge of the fight to stop climate change. What does it mean when the White House says we're watching markets carefully? I've seen it. I've seen it. I've seen it. I've seen it. What does it mean? What does it mean? What does it mean? It means they have a Bloomberg. A multi-trillion dollar industry. There's a lot of ground to cover. Come on, it has got absolutely crushed. We'll show you what's happening in ETFs like no one else. Bloomberg ETF IQ Monday on Bloomberg. I think that it's hard to put your head around any narrative. Let's just be honest. We've had a shift in our way in some sort of circulation fears moment. People were talking about that all day yesterday. This is Dave Reckasio. We're counting down to Asia's major market opens. I'm here in Seoul with I had to the bank of Korea Heidi and of course a lot of big numbers this week. The exports, the 20 day exports coming in. They're down 16.7% in November after being down nearly 6%. That's a worse than expected number. We are seeing some increases in numbers when it comes to new.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1343,2022-11-21 00:01:08
18730," sent in November after being down nearly 6%. That's a worse than expected number. We are seeing some increases in numbers when it comes to new COVID cases out of Beijing is more almost a thousand, also now two deaths being marked of COVID-19 in Beijing. Of course, this is China's first fatalities from the virus in about six months since the Shanghai lockdown. So call the interquestion whether we're going to see a rollback of some of the easing measures that we've seen when it comes to COVID-19 and to that point we've seen out of Shizha-Dong and Guangzhou today various measures being announced including a recommendation to stay at home, mass testing as well. Let's get you straight to the market open Bell. Thanks Heidi Kathleen. So I'm just going to recap those trade numbers as they came through from Korea because they were a significant drop exports down at 16.7% in the first 20 days of November here. So taking a look at how that's affecting trading sentiment at the start of the day. Of course, we do have the open of a Korea and Japan upon us. We're also TV and I'm what's happening with the Korean one this morning because we really have seen that currency strengthening quite considerably. It was one of the worst performers in Asia over the past year but that has now changed direction in terms of what also watching here at the start of trade. So we do have the cost be just inching fractionally high here at the start of the day as well though again just to recap those trade numbers that really quite a big contraction in the first 20 days of November of course Korea is considered a trade of bell weather for the global economy. So it really does tell us as well about these factors that could be hurting that including as you said Heidi what's happening in China this real test of officials there to start to ease possibly from COVID-0 when you do have more places like Guangzhou locking down a district and also the deaths toll in Beijing even though at two perhaps on a global scale quite small but still a very significant one for mainland China. Let's turn now though to what we're seeing in Japan as well because we do have the open of markets here as well the NICA coming online also fractionally high this morning it does also reflect that Friday close we had for the US session even though futures are looking a little bit weaker here as we get underway with trading. The Yen also in focus Carlisle does say that the worst of the Yen losses so far this year are over and that is with this expectation that we could start to see the dollar peaking given that the Fed is also predicted to slow the pace of its hikes even though we do still have more hawkish commentary coming through from Fed officials including the Boston Fed President Susan Miller who's not ruling out a 75 basis point hike in December. To Australia now we're one hour into trading for the ASX 200 and it is another day higher so far although obviously just a little bit modest here but still a third straight session in the green also watch happening what watching what is happening in the oil markets given we did have that huge sell-off drink grew down nearly 10% over the past five days given that these concerns are still in the markets around recessionary fears even though we do have of course expectations that China still could possibly be starting to ease some of its most harshest COVID-zero restrictions. And to that end we are just getting these numbers that you also just touched on when it comes to these numbers almost a thousand new cases for Beijing. That second fatality also in terms of the Hong Kong leadership Hong Kong leader John Lee the announcement that he's tested COVID positive after his visit to Bangkok as well so we'll continue to monitor those lines as we get more details but let's take a look at the impact on markets. Our next guest actually favors Taiwan and Korea equities says that the US dollar will likely weaken as a fair downshifts in December and obviously that has an almost implications for emerging markets. Johnny is now with David Chao, global market strategist for Asia Pacific at Invesco. David I need to get your views on China because obviously we have this building consensus on Wall Street of the bull case for China. When you take a look at these developments this morning the fact that we're now getting fatalities as being the real test of COVID-zero is there a risk that markets are getting ahead of themselves on being exuberant about the reopening and the rebound for China next year? Yes I think there could be some of that and I think that China's reopening and rebound is certainly going to be bumpy and we're already starting to see some of that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1344,2022-11-21 00:05:26
18731," Yeah. Yes, I think there could be some of that. And I think that China's reopening and rebound is certainly going to be bumpy. And we're already starting to see some of that bumps occur now. Now, whether the government and policymakers stick to a reopening plan for now over the next day, six to 12 months, I think that they will. I think that the impetus to reopen is so strong and to get the economy back on track and for China to reengage with the rest of the world, I think that is certainly coming a clear priority for policymakers. We've seen so much turbulence when it comes to the global chips sector over the past six months. When it comes to these chips-specific markets like Taiwan and Korea, though, you're actually quite bullish. Why? I think that the semiconductor industry is very cyclical. And we're currently at the bottom of that cycle. And so investors should think about dipping their toes right now, given where valuations are. And I think that's the race for the future and the tensions between US and China are very much tech-oriented. And so we're going to see continued policy support and investments into that cycle, into that sector over the next couple of decades. So David, when you look at these latest numbers on Korea 20-day exports, of course, it's a bell-weather indicator not just for Korea, but for the entire region. Is this temporary weakness? What's driving it? But particularly, what does that mean for your bullish outlook on Korean equities? Well, I think that investors will most likely see through some of the near-term challenges that both the economy and the semiconductor cycle faces. And certainly markets are forward-looking. I think that we could potentially see additional weakness in exports both in Korea and North Asian economies. As the macro backdrop deteriorates, I think, over the next couple of quarters driven by the US and by Europe. But I think that what we're seeing is that the recession could be more shallow than previously feared. And you're watching for a week or $1. That's been an issue in the last couple of policy meetings for the Bank of Korea, the weakness of the one. And of course, this is potentially a plus. How do you see that playing out the policy steps that the B.O.K. can take if the Fed does start to ease back a bit, at least on the size of rate hikes? I think that gives the Asian central banks, especially the B.O.K. a lot more wiggle room, and that's what they're looking for. Certainly, as long as the Fed is hiking, most A-PAC central banks will have to hike in respond. And as the macro backdrop deteriorates, certainly central banks want to have that wiggle room in order to potentially ease off on some of these hikes. David, is the profit recession over? I think that we're still going to see a bit of pain, especially from earnings. Earnings have been somewhat disappointing both in China in the US and for the region as a whole. But I think that when we look out next year, A-PAC earnings, especially Chinese corporate earnings, are going to be a lot more powerful. I think CSI 300 should be growing around 15% on a year-over-year basis, whereas the places in the US and Europe, I think earnings are not going to be as impressive. David Chow, always great to chat. Global market strategists for Asia Pacific at Invesco. We do have some moves in the ringot at the moment. We have the Malaysian currency falling after the election on the first ever hung parliament. The king has requested party leaders to name a PM by the deadline of 2 PM on Monday. They need to inform the nation's monarch with their choice of prime minister. And the various alliances that they have formed, we know that the two key contenders and Ibrahim as well as Meriden Yassen have both said that they are able to form that coalition. The decision from the king, though, when it comes to the government and the appointment of the premier, will be final in line with the constitution and what Ibrahim Hems party coalition, I should say, got the most parliamentary seats 82 out of 220 against the former premier Yassen, not far behind at 70.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1345,2022-11-21 00:09:47
18732," The party, a coalition, I should say, got the most parliamentary seats 82 out of 220 against the former Premier Yassin, not far behind at 73. So we continue to watch that very, very keenly after that Saturday vote produced Malaysia's first ever hung parliament. And we see that uncertainty being played out in the ring now. Let's get you over to Vony Quinn with the first wet headlines, Vony. Heidi, thank you. As you're saying, we'll continue on the Malaysian elections. Politica leaders have a 2 p.m. Monday to inform the King of their choice of Prime Minister after the vote, produced the first ever hung parliament. Opposition leader, Anwar Ibrahim says he has the numbers to form a government despite falling short of a simple majority. But former Prime Minister, William Yassin, also says his coalition can take power with the support of two regional parties. The UN's atomic agency says powerful blasts have shaken the area around Ukraine's Zaparija nuclear power plant. This includes more than a dozen on Sunday morning. The IAEA says some buildings and systems are damaged to put none critically. Ukraine's nuclear regulator says Russian forces struck the facility, but Russia's army issued a statement blaming Ukraine for the shelling. The IMF says the rise of trade barriers against China and other countries over the past year could cost the global economy $1.4 trillion. Fund-bounditing director Kristina Giorjeva says the potential loss for Asia could be more than 3% of GDP, because the region is more integrated into the global value chain. She wants Asian countries to work together to overcome fragmentation. The world is going to lose 1.5% of GDP just because of divisions that may split us into two trading blocks. This is $1.4 trillion. For Asia, the loss is much more significant because Asia is so integrated in global value chains. It could be 3% or more. The world's biggest single sporting event, Salker's World Cup, has begun in Qatar with a lavish opening ceremony. The Gulf states have been under intense scrutiny leading up to the tournament over the treatment of migrant workers who built seven new stadiums, as well as concerns about human rights and its criminalization of homosexuality. It wasn't the start the host we're hoping for on the pitch either, leading 2-0 by Ecuador in the opening match.

Thank you, Bonnie. Now let's go over to Annabelle for some look at crypto. Is your crypto stocks, Belle? That's right, Kathleen. Just taking a look at some of the biggest movers in Asia that are either linked to this industry or exchanges themselves. Because of course, it is a sector that is very much grappling with its use case and a general downgrade to the overall outlook. It's a very important thing that we had Coinbase, for instance, that was cut to neutral at Bank of America on Friday. Not because it's facing the same issues of FDX necessarily, but Bank of America is still concerned about just generally the broader ecosystem and still, as I said, really justifying or trying to justify its use case, even though you have the likes of the Minneapolis-Bed President, Neil Kashkary, also saying that basically this whole sector is nonsense. Let's change on now, though, also to check in on the energy sector that is also grappling with the commentary from Fed officials around the outlook for tightening. Specifically, they plan to stay higher for longer. And of course, we know that markets are at least pricing for the terminal rate to end up around 5% by the end of the second quarter. So this is the outlook for some of the major energy companies in Asia today, given we did have that huge sell-off in oil last week. Brent Crew just sitting flat here at the start after losing 10% over the past five sessions, or so Heidi. So I had the Bank of Korea expected to raise its key rate this week, continuing the battle against hot inflation. We'll be bringing in JP Morgan Chief to Korea Economist a little bit later. But coming up first, in 87-year-olds man's COVID-related death in Beijing is renewing fears of lockdowns. We've now had reports of two deaths and another more than 950 cases added. We get more on what the officials are calling a grim situation next. This is Bloomberg.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1346,2022-11-21 00:14:12
18733," [♪ OUTRO MUSIC Close STAR NEW I've always been a person who's just been attracted to hair. I like to sit and think and theorize how I can manifest these visions that I have for braiding and how I can take something that may seem like it's a line drawing in my mind and apply that to someone's scalp. We are the only culture that has hair that grows out of our head the way that it does. Anyone from the African diaspora is born with this amazingly curly hair that can be shaped into a variety of different ways of expression. I want black people to love themselves for how they naturally appear and also to appreciate the cultural practice such as braiding that our ancestors have practiced for centuries. Let's get you the latest when it comes to COVID-19, in Beijing. Of course we had that first COVID related death in almost six months and we are just getting the latest numbers when it comes to almost a thousand new cases being added. The COVID death toll now rising to two as of Sunday, 951 new local COVID cases for Sunday as well. In Hong Kong we had confirmation that the Hong Kong leader John Lee had tested positive for COVID as well. All of this playing into fears that we could see a return of heightened restrictions in China. A greater China senior executive editor John Neil joins us now from the Chinese capital John. In addition to that we had new measures being taken in Guangzhou, measures to lock down and remain at home and mass test parts of Shizhao Dran as well. Does all of this throw a bit of cold water on the bullishness for the, you know, you would think that Wall Street thinks the reopening is imminent? Well, certainly challenging. We haven't had this many cases in a long, long time. If you have to get the national numbers for today, but over the weekend on the daily basis they were hovering around 22, 23,000. If we get to 29,000 that will be the highest number of daily cases we have ever had in China throughout the pandemic. You mentioned two additional deaths today in Beijing, a 91 year old woman and an 88 year old man. We had an earlier death on Saturday which was the first death in almost half a year. So you do see things that would normally trigger the government to take a more aggressive stance. We've also seen the city of Shizhao Dran which is near Beijing starting to do mass testing and many of its districts there. You mentioned the lockdown in Guangzhou and so now the question is do growing numbers of infections, do rising deaths trigger a return to where we were before with lockdowns, mass testing and again a closing of the economy. Well, you know, John, we're getting so excited about the COVID-0 starting to transition away, people consumers could cut out and spend money. What's the situation on the ground now? Is that going to pull that kind of dream back?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1347,2022-11-21 00:18:26
18734," Starting to transition away, people, consumers could cut out and spend money. What's the situation on the ground now? Is that going to pull that kind of dream back? Well, certainly the current uptick in infections is going to, I would think, be continuing to depress spending by the consumer. We have, for example, schools and many parts of Beijing today going to online classes. The same is happening in many other parts of the country. The lockdown of the district in Guangzhou is obviously going to stop people from going out and spending. There's a lot of uncertainty and I think in times of uncertainty, people tend to save as opposed to spend. That was greater China senior executive editor John Liu joining us from Beijing. Now to another major story we're following, New Court papers show Sam Bankman-Freeze Bankrupt crypto empire owes its biggest 50 creditors, unsaccurred creditors that is more than $3 billion. The details now from Bloomberg's finance reporter Suvashri Gosh. Was this a surprise? It's much more money than he could possibly get to compensate these people with. Hello. Hi. Thank you so much. Exactly. There are concerns about compensating these people. The recent bankruptcy court filings do say that FTX owes its top 50 creditors $3.1 billion to be precise. Of that, about $200 million each to a couple of creditors which shows that the list is pretty big and we remember that there are more than 1 million creditors for FTX. It shows that this is going to be a long drawn bankruptcy process. Of money owed to a lot of creditors and also there is a global asset review that is going on on FTX's books. So there are a lot of regulators involved. There are a lot of creditors involved. So it's going to be a long drawn process going ahead. What are we looking at for next in terms of the next developments in what has just become the widespread impact of this failure? Well, if you see that already we are seeing concerns across the different kinds of crypto brokers and crypto exchanges. We have seen Genesis and Gemini and BlockFi are the latest ones that were hit. We are also expecting some more news on BlockFi and Genesis. We don't know when there can be a shock. But there are concerns about chapter 11 filings from BlockFi as well. So the contagion is still far from over. We can look for more risks. And of course the markets will also show up those risks in its time. One of the success markets we mentioned is one of those especially on going to you is going bag. So let's go inside the board. Let's suppose you win a proxy fight and or you just get invited on to the board. Go to your first board meeting.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1348,2022-11-21 00:22:53
18735," So let's go inside the boardroom. Let's suppose you win a proxy fight and or you just get invited on to the board. You go to your first board meeting and you're the person who's saying you can fix this company and all of the others on the board of directors are saying well we're doing pretty well. How do you get received when you start saying here's what I wanted you to do? Well first of all we don't bring that to the board. Our time is spent with the CEO, the chairman, the CFO and share our plans with them outside the board. We try never to solve an issue in the board. Okay it's always best done the day before the week before outside the afternoon. We wouldn't be there if they really were doing well. So it's really hard for them to straight face and tell us we're doing well. And we presented with a plan. This is really a reminder isn't it just how sensitive the markets are to any commentary about trade. We did see some pressure on the UN, we did see some pressure on the futures. That is now being reversed. Let's take a look at how features in Europe are opening up for the week. We did see on Friday a pretty exuberant session, Euro stocks really climbing on that investor optimism over China's reopening also bets that central banks globally will slow the pace of hiking. Euro stocks 50 futures looking pretty flat at the moment. This as we did see the blue chip index just almost closing in a bull market there after briefly rallying 20% from those September lows. In Russia, Europe won 1.25% and German darks futures sitting a little bit softer at about a tenth of 1%. We're watching really those cyclicals and some of the laguards retailers travel leisure really seeing that outperformance. The Euro is flat at the moment. We're getting back to China and the presidency in Ping started last week overseas mending ties with the US, ended up with EU leaders making the case for resisting Washington's chip cobes on China. Of course, it began with that momentous seabiden meeting and then a number of meetings with key partners and allies within both the Asia Pacific and in Europe as well as see was at these meetings. How do we gauge the approach to the rest of the world now? I think that we should be looking at what we're hearing from some European leaders. For instance, French President Macron gave a speech on Friday warning about not allowing the world to go into two different orders that saying that we need one order essentially saying that there needs to be some pushback against efforts to decouple the Western world from China, which is something that some people think the United States is trying to do. That's similar to some comments that we heard earlier this month from German Chancellor Schultz when he was visiting China. We also need to be looking very carefully at what the Dutch are saying. The Dutch are really important in all this because the Dutch company, ASML, one of the largest makers of semiconductor equipment. The Dutch are in talks with the US about whether the Dutch should be following along with the US strategy of really imposing strict curbs on exports to China of this kind of technology. The Dutch foreign trade minister has said we're not going to just follow what the Americans are doing one to one. That said, they are going to be having talks with the Americans later this month. And so there is a possibility that the Dutch will do something similar to what the Americans are doing. Of course, this is something that Xi Jinping is really trying to avoid. Do we see European partners booking at the pressure coming from Washington? Because we know that this was, as you say, one of the biggest motivations for those some 20 leaders meetings that President Xi held last week. Yes. And I think one big difference is that Europe, of course, is much more exposed to the higher cost of energy as a result of the Russian...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1349,2022-11-21 00:27:06
18736," One big difference is that Europe, of course, is much more exposed to the higher cost of energy as a result of the Russian war in Ukraine. Inflation, of course, high in the US, but very high in Europe. So the Europeans probably have less interest in having an additional conflict with China that said, though, there are European countries that are warning about the risks of getting too close to China, most notably the Prime Minister Finland warned about becoming too reliant on China's technology. This was just a few days ago. Lithuania, of course, has had a lot of problems with China because of Lithuania's relative opening to Taiwan. So there are divisions within Europe as well about what the best approach to take toward China is. Heidi. I'm Horme there. It's been a busy time for geopolitics. Let's get your quick check now of the latest business flathead lines. Elon Musk has allowed Donald Trump's Twitter account to be restored after users on the social media voted 52% to 48% to allow the former president to return. Musk's decision comes at a time of turmoil inside Twitter. I saw Sosas Toblinberg that the billionaire is considering firing more employees. This time, the layoffs could target the sales and partnerships side of the business. At least a dozen employees have accused Evie Mekker Rivian of safety violations at its Illinois plant. The complaints filed with federal regulators say the company ignored known hazards and missed a range of injuries. In a statement, the company disputes the allegations, saying they creating a safe environment is part of its operating procedures. A spokesperson declined to comment on specific complaints. Japan Post Bank is reportedly considering joining forces with Japan in dust-brew partners and its bid to acquire Tsushiba. The Sahi newspaper reports that the investment may amount to more than $350 million. Bloomberg earlier reported that the JRP consortium was in talks with about 20 potential co-investors. What coming up next on daybreak? We take a look ahead to this big bank of Korea rate call. We saw Guil Park of Jepin Morgan joining us. This is Bloomberg. While Tesla's in the like make for good headlines, the reality is that even if every car on the roads today won't electric, it wouldn't be enough to curb global emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions from transportation account for about 29% of total US greenhouse gas emissions. So what about the other 71%? Building's across America burned fossil fuels to operate. What we want to do is make that all electric. Instead of burning oil and gas to give us the energy and electricity we need, we want to do 100% clean energy, all electric. We want to turn buildings into Tesla's. Just like a Tesla or an electric vehicle is all electric with no fossil fuels, we want to do that with our buildings. If we can do it in one building, we can do it in all buildings. And if we do it in all buildings, we'll reduce 30% of US greenhouse gas emissions.

18737," You're watching daybreak Asia. Past financial crises are haunting South Korean policy makers as they rush to support the local credit markets. Rest points include a weakening one rising rates and inflation of course and a slowdown in exports and lots of data are coming through from Seoul this week including consumer confidence, PPI numbers as well as business sentiment surveys and of course all of this is leading to the Bank of Korea's rate decision on Thursday. Speaking of the one let's get over to Bell for a little bit of a closer look as to what the dynamics we're dealing with here. Yeah that's right Heidi and also it's quite interesting as well we're half known to the trading session for Korea and Japan and we're seeing that really Korea is the low market trading in the red this morning. Perhaps a little bit unsurprising as you said it yes these bigger forces at play and we did have that trade data out at the top as well at 16.7% drop in exports for the first 20 days of November so certainly a sign of just how much Korea is grappling with these external demand forces particularly with demand from China still not picking up even as we do see officials at least starting to move toward COVID-0 in some way or another so that is the outlook of play or trading as I said half an hour into the trading session here for Korea Japan Australia also 90 minutes into trading today as well let's change it on though because yes you just mentioned the Korean one it actually is really turning into one of the best performing currencies in Asia so far this quarter take a look at this function WC RS which also just tracks us on basis if you actually change that to quarter to date instead of year to date you would see that the Korean one has actually gained 6% so far this quarter again it really has been a currency that is more sensitive to those risk factors risk appetite in general you can take a look there that move we've seen so far for the Korean currency Heidi. And a body will is there in Hong Kong let's get you to New York now Bonnie Quinn has our first wet headlines Bonnie. Thank you climate negotiators in Egypt have struck a deal that resets the relationship between rich and poor countries approved without a single opposing voice the agreement creates a fund that helps developing nations face the devastation of climate change although the deal is an historic victory negotiators fail to secure commitments for more ambitious cuts on greenhouse gas emissions. The US and China have resumed formal talks on climate change China's climate envoy says the two countries agree to discuss how to address the losses and damages developing nations are experiencing as a consequence of climate change but he also said any new deal should mirror the power of agreement. Turkey has carried out airstrikes against US backed Turkish-Gardish militant groups in Iraq and Northern Syria. The Defense Ministry says the raids were to eliminate what it called its terrorist threat and come after a deadly bombing that targeted civilians in Istanbul.

All right let's get more from Seoul now where Kathleen is and of course a lot of data flow this week from Korea at a very challenging economic time but of course all of this is building up to that bank of Korea right cool. It certainly is and here to help us look into all of this here in our Seoul studio is Sokild Park. He's chief Korean economist at JPMorgan. Thank you for joining us this morning. That's a beautiful one here in Seoul. I want to start on those export numbers. The 20 day exports down very sharply. What do you make of that? Yeah indeed you're right. Korean export number has been going down in the recent weeks and the months is including this morning's number. But at the same time you have to bear in mind that most of the dragging effect is the price effect instead of the volume. If you compare the price growth and volume growth volume growth is relatively better than holding a better than the nominal export.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1351,2022-11-21 00:35:49
18738," instead of the volume. If you compare the price growth and the volume growth, volume growth is relatively better than holding a better than the nominal export growth. So in terms of the growth profile and then what matters is the real volume growth, which means that we think the creates real GDP growth should be fairing better than what is the nominal export growth is in flying for. So as we look ahead to Friday, a lot of things for the Bank of Korea to look at as it makes that decision, probably between 25 basis points and 50 basis points in terms of the rate hike. When you look at the balance between where inflation is, if the pressures look like they're continuing to build or decline, when you look where the economy is going, where do you see them going? Actually, as the terminal rate is now the near, the real now at the three and the terminal rate maybe 3.5 or 3.75. So we haven't long been expecting that the Bank of Korea's policy hike cycle should be more gradual than before instead of the 50, but it may be 25 because we are not fully sure that the homage we have to get to. So as the end of the hike cycle is nearby, we think that the UK will adjust its messages that maybe the end of the end is near and probably it may go on if the inflation number is not stabilizing enough, but there hasn't some only size of inflation is starting to the roll off. So I think it's the right timing for them to adjust the pace of the policy hike. Does the extreme credit market volatility we have seen over the last month, and these concerns about financial stability, liquidity, etc. Does it maybe seal the deal for 25 instead of 50? It may be one of the factors to affect that because I think the BOK is trying to strike right balance between the inflation stabilizing mandate versus the financial market stabilization mandate. So to that and I think the BOK is not to jeopardize its mandate to stabilizing inflation when they are stabilizing the financial market. So 25 basis point, which may be in line with the financial market expectation and that will be helping to stabilize the market sentiment itself. Do you see any way in which this market episode seems to stabilize, but there's still a lot of concern whether it's ended completely or not is going to hit the economy or could hit the economy if it continues? I think it is inevitable to see some of the cost of the policy hike because in terms of the growth slowdown and also some sporadic financial stress incidents like we have observed in the past couple of months. But at the same time I have to stress that that is the required slowdown or some stresses to stabilize the inflation expectation itself. So if the Fed Reserve signals and maybe even does a 50 basis point hike instead of 75, what is that going to mean for Korean credit markets? Number one and the Bank of Korea number two. Korean credit market situation is more about domestic credit conditions and yes you are right it depends on how far the BOK can go and that is the function of how far the can Fed can go. But at the same time it's not one to on automatic mechanism that the Fed policy rate to the Bank of Korea. It will be indirectly related. But I think it will be pinned down by the how much the coin inflation can stabilize going forward from here. I think that would be the key to what? How about the one, what role is that playing? It had been Asia's, you know, one of the weakest currencies in the world that's had quite a rebound possibly partly because people or investors are looking for somewhat less aggressive Bank of Korea. How important is that? How do you see that playing out? Where do you see the one going? Let me focus on some macroeconomic factor for the FX market. In our sense the some weakness of the Korean one currency was reflecting the sharp deterioration of a tons of trade and I think going forward what don't make the quite key to what is the",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1352,2022-11-21 00:40:04
18739," The Korean one currency was reflecting the sharp deterioration of a tons of trade. I think going forward, what would make the key to what is where the tons of trade will be recovering further from here. And in terms of the impact from the effects market into the policies, actually it should be some indirect impact from the currency to the bank of Korea's policy. So because the Korean currency clearly inflation targeting centriping, not the currency targeting centriping, in a way that if currency weakness impacting the inflation outlook and the inflation outlook will affect the Korean currency decision. But at the same time, I have distressed that there's more indirect decision making process. So to the end, to some degree, the 50-basins were high decision in October. So it was affected by the currency movement. But from here on, if the currency market is as stable as now, then I don't think that would be the major factor for the UK to change its behavior. Well, I'll talk to you Friday. We'll see what happens. On Thursday, thank you so much. That's so cool, Park. Chief Korean economist at JP Morgan. And up next, we'll talk with a former political secretary to explanation prime minister, Najib Rizak, here, why Asun-O'ol expects fresh challenges which ever party claims power after the weekend's indecisive election. This is Bloomberg. You will shed light on dark matter. You will make aging optional. Because when you subscribe to Bloomberg, you won't just get news. You'll get insight into limitless possibilities. Before you change the world, Bloomberg. All right. Take a look at the Malaysian ring. We're seeing that reaction across the currency as a reaction to Malaysia seeing its first ever hung parliament. We see the ring at trading just about 6% of a percent lower there at the moment against the US dollar. We have seen that broad pause in the US dollar strength recently. But of course, we await for that 2pm deadline, which was given by the king for the possible coalitions to be formed and delivered for a decision to be made. So those plans should be presented later on Monday afternoon. Let's bring Julia Salina, who has been on the ground in KEL, covering this election as well as Asun-O'ol, who's a principal advisor at the Pacific Research Centre. He previously served as political secretary to the former Malaysian prime minister Najib Rizak. Jules, let me begin by just getting the latest from you as to what we can expect today. Yeah, Heidi, as you say, Malaysia's first ever hung parliament and the king does want a decision by 2pm. So a lot of deal-making going on since Saturday's election. It does look like it's going to come down to the former ruling coalition BN as to who they give their seats to. They have 30. You have opposition.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1353,2022-11-21 00:44:27
18740," going on since Saturday's election. It does look like it's going to come down to the former ruling coalition, BN, as to who they give their seats to. They have 30. You have opposition and leader Anne White, Ibrahim's, P.H. party with 82 of the 220 seats needed. And then you have the former Premier Mojave Hedden-Jasins P.N. party with 73. This is the pro-Islamic party and it is more likely as we were hearing from James Chin earlier from the University of Tasmania that P.N. and BN will go together and form a coalition which will probably be not unlike the government we've just had just with a different leader. And at the same time you had Malaysia's longest serving Prime Minister Mahatya Muhammad at age 97 losing his seat of Lankawi, so ending his political career hiding. Let's get some more from our guest now, Jules, in this conversation. How do you see this playing out as we head into that afternoon deadline? And do you see, as you say, alliances of convenience being formed to be able to get it over the line? Aesim, just wanted to check that you can hear me in terms of what's going to happen. Yes, sorry. Well, I think there are two distinct possibilities now. Number one, you have indeed the P.N. plus B.N. coalition coming together and that would be very similar to the previous coalition. On the other hand, I think O.I.s are on the president of the Amno party, which leads the B.N. coalition, if he were to lead his party in forming a coalition with Pakatan Harapan or with Anwaiyib Rahit, then indeed you'll be the other side which could form the new government. I think a lot of more reformist minded Malaysians looking forward to that while the more conservative minded Malaysians are looking forward to more of the same, namely the P.N. and D.N. coalition coming together once again. Would one result over the other deliver more economic stability and positivity? Well, I think the worldwide investors are looking forward to perhaps more innovative policies from Malaysia. Malaysian Ringgit has been sliding and its economic growth is also taking a backseat to this sort of political struggle. So I think a person such as Anwaiyib Rahit would bring confidence to the international investment community while, for example, in Islamist, Lat government by P.N. and D.N. on the other hand, they would really have to lay out what would be dear plans in terms of reviving the economy. Julia, here in Kuala Lumpur, how much do you see the young or the youth vote really impacting here? Because we know nearly six million new voters were eligible, but we were speaking earlier to a guest who said so far the data doesn't show that they necessarily came out as much as we were expecting, but they are certainly very much focused here on the economy rather than racial based politics. Well, indeed, I think Malaysia at the moment, it's recovering from the onslaught of the pandemic and a lot of people are having troubles getting along with their livelihood, their food shortage, their fly away inflation. And at this critical juncture, you were to install a government which perhaps places more importance on, for example, racial supremacy, religious issues and so on. I think you'll be very hard to form a Malaysia to regain its credibility internationally in terms of being the favorite investment destination. Yeah, absolutely. And that just comes back to that point about how much",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1354,2022-11-21 00:48:46
18741," the investment destination. Yeah, absolutely, and that just comes back to that point about how much foreign inflows you could see because they have dropped off dramatically since the 2018 election. You've also got the RINGET trading at this this 24-year low. So just tell us about some of the the pressures here on the economy. Well, I think since the onslaught of pandemic, a lot of people, for example, they have been very hard put in terms of either losing their jobs or sometimes having their wages, slash and so on. And the previous government, which was dissolved a billion months ago, well, they try to provide a lot of assistance, handouts and so on. But these are not long-term solutions because Malaysia would need to in a sense transform its economy from a middle income one to hopefully a high value added one. There's a fair share of electronics industry in Malaysia concentrated in some pockets of industrial clusters. But you know, for example, the food supply in Malaysia is not sufficient. And that has been made very prominent during the pandemic. Namely, people do not have enough to eat. And of course, the prices are really sky-high nowadays. Yeah, absolutely. My producer and I were out on the weekend and speaking to Malaysians at wet markets at food centers. And that was certainly a key point about the cost of food. I just wanted to ask you as well. We were talking about former Prime Minister, the Longest Service, serving Prime Minister Mahatya Muhammad, losing his land. How we see it? What is his legacy? Well, the Dr. Mahatya transformed this country from an agricultural days one to one, which is much more industrialized. And there was his main contribution to the country, raising the income from lower end towards the middle one. The challenge now is of course how to raise that further such an Malaysia could become a high income nation, a developed nation, by definition, and also in practice. That's why it's critically important at this juncture that you would have a number one, a stable government, but number two also a visionary government with the kind of competence, with the kind of expertise, with the kind of sincerity and integrity to bring this country forward. We heard we had to have a government which is led by Islamist. I think you'll be very hard put to gain this sort of food haul in the worldwide economy. How strong will the Islamist policy platform be given the outperformance of past in this election? Well, they are now the single party with the largest number of members of parliament. And even if they do not put up a prime minister, I think, well, by definition they'll be controlling a lot of policy generation, policy outputs of the new government, if they were to be the the new government. And if we look at examples from elsewhere around the world, Turkey immediately would come to mind. And Islamist led government, typically number one, it would try to make the previously functioning democracy into an illiberal one. But I think that would indeed be a very challenging combination. Isun, our principal advisor at the Pacific Research Center there with us, another very Anjuli Asali who continue to keep us updated as we get towards that 2 pm deadline to come up with those coalition plans.

18742," Deadline to come up with those coalition plans. More to come here on Daybreak Asia. This is Blondad. I'm going to show you what's happening in ETFs like no one else. I'm John Bloomberg. Well I learned fast fashion giant, she rapidly gained global popularity, especially among Gen Z on TikTok where influencers would frequently show off all videos from the retailer, but laboratory testing conducted for Bloomberg on two occasions this year found that the garments shipped to the US by Sheen were made with cotton from China's Xinjiang region where US officials say China abuses the weaker minority. Let's bring Rachel Chang who leads our Asia consumer health and media team. Let's be honest, Sheen as a potentially heads for an IPO, there's a lot of highly problematic ESG issues with this company. What have you found? I mean very much so, you have to realize that this is a brand that has really built its success on being cheaper than anyone else on churning out crop tops and dresses at a crazy rate, really satisfying young people who really buy things for one time for social media posts and then they're done. It's a very much disposable fashion, very much taking that model to the extreme. It's not surprising to know that the ESG wise and in terms of using the cotton from Xinjiang, which we know is readily available to them in China as a Chinese manufacturer, that all of these are now coming up to the fore because it is becoming so powerful in such a big company and the spotlight is getting stronger. Rachel, when it comes to economy imports, what are we actually seeing because the math of all suggests that plenty of cotton from Xinjiang is still making its way to US shores and US consumers? Right, that's right and it all goes back to what they call this $800 exemption for individual purchases on e-commerce and a lot of Chinese retailers, not just Sheen, really take advantage of that because we know that the US customs blocks mass imports of anything made with labor from Xinjiang but these packages are actually delivered to individuals directly as long as each purchase is under $800 USD. They doesn't go through customs, it's considered an individual parcel. So through that, we know that substantial amounts of a pair made with Xinjiang cotton are still getting to US consumers. Rachel Chang there with that great report, you can find that on the terminal. So that is it for that break Asia, our market's coverage is next with the start of trading in Hong Kong, Shanghai and Xinjiang.

18743," Hi, I'm Shenzhen. This is Bloomberg. These flooring flowers are made of 92,000 solar panels. They can generate 41 megawatts, which is enough to power 20,000 homes. It's one of the biggest flooring solar plants in the world. Floating solar rays have been gaining traction in Asia, including countries like Singapore and Thailand. Floating projects typically benefit from an easier connection to the power grid. They can also restrict algae blooms while keeping the solar panels cool. This one in particular has healthy local economy. When the power plant was first proposed, residents were given the chance to invest. Some locals were also offered jobs during construction. In fact, it was the community that requested the panels to be shaped as flowers to look more appealing. South Korea sterilized heavily on imported fossil fuels, but will need to change that to reach its goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2050. Solar plants like this one may help the country reach its net zero goals. What do you think of when you think of a battery? For most, it's what we use to power devices for both work and play, and maybe even your car. Over the past few decades, they've gotten way more powerful, long-lasting, and affordable. But all of this is just a prologue to what the next batteries are going to do. As we drive to an increasingly renewable power driven grid, we also need to be able to store energy and release it later to cover those periods of weather intermittencies that are driving this new grid that we're in. It's a multi-trillion dollar opportunity, and it's imperative that we figure out the solution here. How we store energy on a massive scale is in many ways the central challenge of the fight to stop climate change. Good Monday morning from Hong Kong. It's 9am here in the city up in Beijing, and also in Shanghai. Welcome to Bloomberg Market's China Open. I'm David Engles. Let's get to your top stories. As we get this new week.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1357,2022-11-21 01:01:51
18744," Hong Kong is 9am here in the city up in Beijing and also in Shanghai. Welcome to Bloomberg Market's China Open. I'm David Inglis. Let's get to your top stories as we get this new week underway. Concerns that Beijing may return to stricter virus restrictions that have to shine reports. It's first COVID-related deaths in almost six months. But this bullish consensus for Chinese assets is emerging on Wall Street with newfound optimists and around President Xi Jinping's policy pivots and the fallout from FTX continues. Court documents reveal the company owes its 50 biggest creditors over $3 billion. Yep, we'll unpack that FTX story for you in just a moment. Certainly the magnitude of such is making my head spin. Welcome to the show. It's by the way. Hope you're all well. Let's have a look at how markets are shaping up as we get underway. Of course, this week, dollar down, well, dollar up, stocks down, yields down, oil is down after really what was really one of the worst weeks for oil prices in what months, if not this year, really depending on which contract you're looking at here. A lot on the deck today as far as China's concern, you have a loan primary coming out, inflation out of Hong Kong. We'll talk about all the updates as far as COVID is concerned. You have updates over in Guangzhou. Beijing will get to that in just a moment here. Malaysia's also coming back online. Elections on the weekend. First ever Hong parliament. We are seeing some weakness in the ring. It's also unpackingly what that means short term and what that might mean longer term as far as the fiscal discipline might be concerned. 2 p.m. is what we're watching out for as far as that deadline is concerned there. And of course, it's also a big week as far as macro pictures concerned. Fed minutes are coming out. There's a rate decision over in Korea. So we'll talk about all those things. I didn't mention, of course, we're also getting this bond route over in China. This repricing of growth expectations in next year. And the general expectation is, as we make our way into the open, is that the bulk of the move for now, as far as the move up in yields, is behind us. Let's see what happens here. Bitcoin bought on your screens right now. 16,200. Right. Let's start things off here with an update on what happened over the weekend at the last few hours over in China here. So you had the first COVID-related deaths in over six months or almost six months. You're sparking some concern. The Beijing might actually return to heightened restrictions. Let's bring in John Lille, our great China senior executive editor, joining us now out of Beijing. John, good morning. A lot to talk about. Let's start off in Beijing. What happened over the weekend? Where are we now? So we had our first death in half a year reported in Beijing on Saturday. This morning, we got reports of two additional deaths on Sunday, a 91-year-old woman and an 88-year-old man. We've got almost 1,000 new cases reported for Sunday. That report came this morning. We've got schools in the city around the city's shut gone to online learning. There have been businesses shut. People in the District of Chao, which is where many of multinational embassies are located here in Beijing. Residents of that district are being asked to stay in that district, not to go to other districts unless they have to. As of the situation is relatively tense, I would say. I think the big question is, as you pointed out, do these spikes and infections, increases in deaths? Does that result in a backpiling in terms of the opening of the economy that the government started down the path of last week? Is there a sense, John, that we return somewhat to stricter policies? I mean, what's your sense of where we go in your term? And also, I guess, how is Chinese media local media framing the issue right now, too? Well, the initial returns are not optimistic. We have the city of Shu Dao Dran, relatively close to Beijing, doing mass testing, asking everybody to stay home. That sort of echoes back to the playbook that Chinese governments around the country used before this latest opening. We have the city of Guangzhou reporting 8,000 new cases for Sunday, and the government there locking down a local district. And so you do see some of the old strategies being put back into play. But that being said, I think we were always going to have this point in time where, as you loosen, infectious are going to rise.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1358,2022-11-21 01:06:13
18745," to have this point in time where, as you loosen, infections are gonna rise and with higher infection rates or higher numbers of infections, there were gonna be deaths. And so it is not unexpected the situation that China faces now, whether the government pushes through has the wherewithal to continue with the opening, I think we're gonna have to wait and see still. Yep, uncertainty, John, as you point out, is precisely where we are right now as far as this is concerned. John Leo, our senior executive editor there, of course, life was out of Beijing. And of course, you just saw there, a recap really of everything that we've taken place here so far, 8,000 cases in Guangzhou and we're looking at about 6,000 over in Chongqing and of course, Shujia, Zhuang, is the new one to watch here. Now, we had a look at a data too, right? So in terms of city by city, let's start things off in Beijing. This is subway data. It compares really 2020, which was really when things were shut down almost completely in most major parts of China. Blue line is where we are right now. And orange is that sweet spot in between, of course, where domestically things were stable. As you can see, Beijing is on the way down. Let's flip the boards, please Shanghai, that massive dip, of course, that we had early this year. We haven't recovered very, very slowly here, but it's on the way up here. Chongqing and Guangzhou, those are your two hot spots today. And as you can see, ridership here has just completely fallen off. As well, there we go in Guangzhou, where there is a new district that is on lockdown starting, I believe, today for the next five days. We'll keep you abreast of what's happened here. Of course, let's turn our attention now to the latest on FTX and Mano Man. The magnitude of this one is making my head spin. New court documents now show here that the bankrupt crypto empire owes 50 of its biggest, unsecured credit, it was more than $3 billion. Let's bring in Shubash Rigosh to talk us through this or finance reporter. Okay, I don't know where to start here. Let's talk about the scale of what the company owes, what do we know, and how large are these individual loans, if you will. Sure. Thank you. Yeah, as you said, like, it's really a headspinning thing. I mean, you can't understand where this is going to end. According to the recent court filing, the bankruptcy filing, so we see that FTX owes to its stock creditors more than $3 billion. We precise $3.1 billion and out of them, about $200 million each to a couple of creditors. So that's a big amount of money, to be honest, and you have to see also, if you're also remember that FTX has $10 billion of worth of liabilities. So we are seeing a lot of these big numbers unfolding coming out about FTX's balance sheet that shows that the bankruptcy process is going ahead, but it'll take some time to kind of, you know, unfold the how these creditors will get paid eventually, because these are big numbers that we're talking about here. Right, and do we have to your point? Do we have any more clarity as to, I mean, since you're talking about claims here right now, on what assets there are for these claimants to start, I guess, haggling over. Well, to be, initially, we just know that this is like the tokens that they hold, we don't know exactly what the breakup of these are, because, you know, this is part of the filings of the transparency processes, but there are no names, no tokens, no breakups there. But so far, we know that the amount is big, and that's going to be a process we have to see how this will be divided among the creditors in terms of, because these are unsecured creditors. So there has to be a process in which, in proportion it way, they have to be recovered from FTX, and we are not clear how that will be going ahead, but yes, they have to be paid to some extent as is the process in bankruptcy. Yeah, 10 of those claims have more than 100 million age based on those filings. Thank you so much, our finance reporter, there, Savashri Gosh there. Right, okay, here we go. Latest numbers here, China are out. This is for Sunday, 26,000. This is nationwide cases here, new local COVID cases. So we talked about really how some of these things, of course, Guangzhou, one district there, Shujia Zhuang has basically suspended in-person classes as residents to stay put. So I guess that really is it for an answer. Certainly the question is, do we get a backpedaling as far as the PIP?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1359,2022-11-21 01:10:37
18746," Classes ask residents to stay put. So I guess that really is it for an answer. Certainly the question is do we get a backpedaling as far as the the the pivots are concerned as far as the some of the restrictions are concerned here. Well, we'll see what markets do. We're all watching reopening stocks ahead of the reopen. Now speaking of looking ahead here, let's take you through what is likely going to be yet another busy and big week here. You have fed minutes coming out. That's a big event today. Well, a big event this week. You have a rate decision here in the region. You have a short and trading week. Black Friday, of course, thanksgiving. So we're going into that towards the latter part of this week. World Cup, by the way, it's not there. And of course, the low prime rates are due out in about six minutes or not. And in between, of course, a scattering here of about 40 or so companies in Asia, Pacific, big ones at that that are set to report earnings. May 21 included their these next few days. All right, let's get it over now to Wani Quinn. She is in New York and she has your first renewing. Spani? David, thank you. Good morning. The US and China have resumed formal talks on climate change. China's climate envoys says the two countries agreed to discuss how to address the loss of damages developing nations are experiencing as a consequence of climate change. But he also said any new deal should mirror the Paris agreement. Malaysian political leaders have until 2 p.m. Monday to inform the king of their choice of prime minister. That's after Saturday's vote produced the country's first ever hung parliament. Opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim says he has the number is to form a government, despite falling short of a simple majority. But former prime minister Amweed and Yassin also says his coalition can take power with the support of two regional parties. The UN's atomic agency says powerful blasts have shaken the area around Ukraine's up region nuclear power plant. This includes more than a dozen on Sunday morning. The IAEA says some buildings and systems were damaged, but none, critically. Ukraine's nuclear regulator says Russian forces struck the facility, but Russia's army issued a statement, blaming Ukraine for the shelling. The IMF says the rise of trade barriers against China and other countries over the past year could cost the global economy $1.4 trillion. Fund managing director Kristina Giorjefah says the potential loss for Asia could be more than 3% of GDP, because the region is more integrated into the global value chain. She wants Asian countries to work together to overcome fragmentation. The world is going to lose 1.5% of GDP just because of divisions that may split us into two trading blocks. This is $1.4 trillion. For Asia, the loss is much more significant because Asia is so integrated in global value chains. It could be 3% or more. Global news, 24 hours a day on air and our member quick take power by more than 2700 journalists and more than 120 countries. This is Bloomberg. Vani, yep. We will have more from that conversation we had there with the IMF managing director, including YG. Increasing fragmentation in global economies like throwing fuel on the fire caused by the war in Ukraine. Also coming ahead here, and he's actually on set with me right now. There we go. They have reversed two years of caution in China and the latest news on COVID there and lockdowns could change that view. Coming down to the open of trade. Latest case numbers are out.

18747," I've always been a person who's just been attracted to hair. I like to sit and think and theorize how I can manifest these visions that I have for braiding and how I can take something that may seem like it's a line drawing in my mind and apply that to someone's scalp. We are the only culture that has hair that grows out of our head the way that it does. Anyone from the African diaspora is born with this amazingly curly hair that can be shaped into a variety of different ways of expression. I want black people to love themselves for how they naturally appear and also to appreciate the cultural practice such as braiding that our ancestors have practiced for centuries. As long as the direction toward reopening is the air, I think market will be street through and as we spoke earlier this year, GDP girls will recover by second quarter next year and with the reopening, with the possibility of better confidence on the property market, we might see a stronger than expected recovery in six months time and market should lead the fundamental. Both of us here are trying to equity strategists. We will just outlining her bullish call there as you joined us last week. Welcome back to the show. By the way, you're watching to China Open just in time here. So a couple of things are out. You have the, well, the fixes out. Well, it should be at any time now. We are getting the loan prime rates for November one in five year, both unchanged, 365 on to one year, 430 on to five years. So remaining unchanged as far as that's concerned, we should be getting to reference right now. Here we go, 712 56 is the midpoint for the day, almost right on cue here, joining us here in set, Ajay Kapoor, global research head of emerging market strategy at both of security, joining us right now to talk us to two years. You've changed your view now. It's bullish. How strong do you think that signal was out of policy makers within days, right? COVID, property and foreign relations. Good morning, David. Great to be back. Yes, I've been cautious on Chinese equities for exactly two years now. It was November 2020 when we downgraded China. That time it was very expensive, especially the growth stocks. The merit cycle was turning down. Regulatory policy was getting much tighter. And so you're absolutely right. Last week on Thursday, we had a move away from the very strict COVID-zero protocols. On Friday, we had the 16 point program to help the property sector. It was two years after the three red lines came out, if you remember, which is really what started the downturn the property sector. And then on the weekend, we had the G20 where I think the mood music was much better, surprisingly better. And so these are three policies that I call vectors of uncertainty. In other words, no one had any clue where they were going to go. But then we did figure out where they're going to go. At least the direction of travel is reasonably clear. So yes, on Monday, I changed my view. Because I'd written about three weeks ago that Chinese equities having fallen 60 to 70% were no longer overvalued. In fact, the growth stocks are about 20% undervalued. Value stocks are about 25% undervalued. Also our measure of sentiment called risk love for Chinese equities was very low. My colleague Nigel Tupper, who's now in town meeting clients, he looks at the positioning of long-only funds in various markets. And his view is that the mutual funds are very underweight in China. So we're positioning sentiment and valuation standpoint. Things were already in place. And then we got these policy reversals. Right. So that's why I changed my mind. The triggers. And he almost reminded me too. I just remembered. It's also three years, I believe, since Atgot pulled, right? About November 2019. SALVING IM PLEOS",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1361,2022-11-21 01:19:19
18748," policy reversals. So that's why I changed my mind. The triggers. And you almost reminded me too. I just remember it. It's also three years I believe since aunt got pulled right about November 2019 at IPO. Short-term risks though to the view. I mean, you had the case count again. I mean, things are not going to go up in a straight line. Let's put it that way. What are you watching on for short term? Well, I'm watching the COVID cases. I think it might be a little bit like Hong Kong's reopening. Okay. You know, can we use this as a template as a pilot project? And I think our reopening is going pretty well, I would say. Yeah. You know, relatively, relatively. Yeah. You know, compared to where we were, let's say six months ago. So I think obviously I'm going to watch that. I actually don't think that they're going to do another U-turn. I think that this, you know, normally the Chinese authorities, policymakers think through the act slowly, but then the act firmly, obviously if conditions warranted, if there's a complete disaster, then maybe. But I don't think that's the case. I think we're moving in the right direction now. In terms of positioning, I mean, one could argue the massive move we've seen the last two, three-week, twenty-thirty percent. Yeah. What's a shift from extreme barriers to this? Maybe back to neutral. Where do you think we are? Are we, at least, in new laws started to be created? We're not at neutral positioning at all. Look far from it. Absolutely not. I mean, it's interesting. A lot of investors will be talked to them. They say something similar that, hey, it's up 2025. We're done. Let's go home. And actually, that's not true. I mean, in a bear market rally, yes, you do 20 and then you're done in China. But if this is a new cyclical bull market, which I believe it is, then those rallies, those bull markets go on for 15 to 18 months on average. And they don't stop it up 25 percent. They go up a lot more. When do you think, we'll talk more about the economy later on, but when do you think we get that earnings follow through then? When do you think earnings bottom? Right. So I think the earnings, so the leading earnings indicators for China are two. One is your own Bloomberg's. The Chinese credit impulse change. So it's CHBGR EVA. I love it. I love it. CHBGR, I love that indicator. Guys, just bring that up. You can put that up if you can. And it has been picking up for many, many months now. And it's a very good leading indicator of the Chinese earnings cycle. And my colleague Helen Schaus, FCI, financial conditions index, is also telling me that the earnings are probably going to bottom out in the next few months, lash quarters. But the market sees through all of that that we can't wait for the bottom and earnings to get bullish. We need to predict that. And so I think it's not that far away. Bottom, well, the top on dollar China for this cycle. Have you seen that? Yeah, this is Claudio's call. My colleague Claudio Perron. And the house view is that we're going to probably see some modest dollar weakness, especially versus the euro and some Asian currencies. But it's not a big gigantic call. It's more like modest dollar weakness. All right. Ajikapur, we're staying with us. Of course, we'll unpack more of that call in a bit. Plus, of course, everything on the economy there. Right. A couple of stocks to watch as we approach the opening play, obviously, on the back of, well, quite a big move up in recent weeks, moved on as expected today. Let's first COVID death. I think we're out three now. I think two on Saturday or one on Sunday. We're at three right now. This is Beijing, by the way. We're also looking at JD.com, flip the boards. Please, if we can't earnings out on Friday after the Hong Kong close, we did get already some moves. Of course, in the US session, both a beaten top and bottom line. Plus, some of the lithium related shares really on the back of basically trying to telling its producers to produce more. Right. So we'll see what happens with that. Certainly very pronounced policy risk as far as that sector is concerned. There's plenty more ahead here in show. Let's keep it here. You're watching Bloomberg. Good morning.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1362,2022-11-21 01:23:38
18749," So let's go inside the boardroom. Let's suppose you you win a proxy fight and or you just get invited on to the board. You go to your first board meeting and you're the person who's saying you can fix this company and all of the others on the board of directors are saying well we're doing pretty well. How do you get received when you start saying here's what I want you to do? Well first of all we don't bring that to the board. Our time is spent with the CEO of the chairman, the CFO and share our plans with them outside the board. We try never to solve an issue in a board. Okay it's always been best done the day before the week before outside that. We wouldn't be there if they really were doing well. So it's really hard for them to straight face if they're doing well. And we present them with a claim. BSO now is your online home for weekly Boston Symphony Orchestra and Boston Pops performances. See new concerts that go behind the scenes plus acclaimed archival concerts. Visit PSO.org slash now where the music plays on. BSO season sponsor Bank of America. Right welcome back. So I mean liquidity has been something we've been tracking very close in as you look at futures right now called lower. I mean on the back of that adjustment and yields that we had. Big one of course last week and then you had some withdrawals marked to market. And the call is certainly when you look at the 10 year yield is that the bulk of the move for now is behind us. That's roughly consensus. Certainly not an exhaustive list there. PBC out draining how much let me just look at my screen share 2 billion. That's the first time since November 9 which isn't really it's about two weeks. Two weeks old. There are 2 billion Remembe and Open Market operations. Right let's get your quick check of your latest business flash headlines now. Elon Musk you probably saw this on Twitter and has not allowed Donald Trump's Twitter account to be restored after users on a social media website voted 52% to 48% to allow the former president's return to the platform here. Musk's decision comes at a time of turmoil inside Twitter and a source is tell Bloomberg that the billionaire is considering firing more employees. This time the layoffs could target the sales and partnership side of the business. Now Japan post-bank is reportedly considering joining forces with Japan industrial partners here in its bid to acquire Kishiba. The Assad newspaper reports that the investments may amount to more than $350 million than Bloomberg earlier reported that the JIP consortium here was in talks with about 20 potential co-investors. Now the financial times is reporting that Chinese authorities are helping Foxconn restaff its iPhone assembly lines. The Hanan government reportedly ordered officials to recruit new workers for the iPhone maker while Foxconn raised wages and also offering bonuses to attract the staff. Fox Foxconn suffered a worker exit as late last month. That's a mend of course at COVID-19. Outbreak which by the way continues to remain one of our top stories today given all the developments that we had at Overing Guangzhou. Shijia Zhuang is a new one of course so they've basically ordered everyone residents there to stay home. In-person classes have been suspended. We'll unpack the story for you in just a moment here. All right making our way into the open here. What do we have our demographics are concerned here. So I mean we're looking at rates normalizing. That's one. We're looking at futures pointing down. There's also some changes in the indices themselves. This review of course the results of which were announced on Friday. So a couple of stops are falling. Billy Billy was removed. Ting Yi is up after it was added to the HSI here. In terms of China rates normalizing. So we put a one-week inner bank rate. So it is moving up and it's converging back to really where the PBOC's benchmark is. So that's just watched it very closely today. We flashed it line four you guys earlier on. It's two billion net withdrawal out of the PBOC today.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1363,2022-11-21 01:27:54
18750," or the PBOC's benchmarking. So that's just watched it very closely today. And we flashed it line four you guys earlier on as two billion net withdrawals out of the PBOC today. A couple of other things. On-deck inflation numbers are out of Hong Kong. We're done with the low end prime rates in case you missed that unchanged Macau visitor arrivals are also on-deck today. And MSCI China looks like as things stands, three becomes four. The open just three minutes away, stay with us. This is Bloomberg. Good morning. Right. While Tesla's in the like make for good headlines, the reality is that even if every car on the roads today won't be electric, it wouldn't be enough to curb global emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change. greenhouse gas emissions from transportation account for about 29% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. So what about the other 71%? Building across America burned fossil fuels to operate. What we want to do is make that all electric. Instead of burning oil and gas to give us the energy and electricity we need, we want to do 100% clean energy, all electric. We want to turn buildings into Tesla's. Just like a Tesla or an electric vehicle is all electric with no fossil fuels, we want to do that with our buildings. And if we can do it in one building, we can do it in all buildings. And if we do it in all buildings, we'll reduce 30% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Good morning. Here we go. So it looks like we'll be giving up more of the gains that have been built up out of last what I'm counting out three. Three and a half weeks or so. We'll be doing a couple of things. A couple of things. Well, low and prime rate, let's start with that. Unchange for both in one and five years. An update here in COVID. Trying to report its first deaths in nearly six months. So that's something to consider there as far as maybe would they need to revisit to some extent of course the fine tuning of COVID policy. Certainly when you have used like Guangzhou for example locking down one district that's one not the entire city for five days kind of makes you think so. Here we go. Open it's next and we are just just broadly speaking of course. The backdrop here is also risk assets falling. So Asia's falling. U.S. futures are also giving back some of the gains in recent days or one percent lower. So you're looking at a 50 moving average here on the sea of sorry 300 which by the way we managed to close above I think mid week last week and then going into the weekend of course closing right below that level there. Flip the boards please the open in Hong Kong is doing this. MSCI China on a three day losing streak should be number four today and quite some sharp losses there at the start of trade 4.2 percent on the H.S. Tech index also do consider some changes there as far as index constituents he's concerned. Look at iron ore. Well some of the onshore commodities dollar China just the base at the quarter of last week. I can't remember but any case of course 2.8 percent. Yeah there we go thank you so.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1364,2022-11-21 01:32:13
18751," Iron ore, well some of the onshore commodities, dollar China just the bystander quote from last week. I can't remember but any case of course, 2.8 percent. Yeah, there we go. Thank you so much. They're just updating right now. And I look at some of the reopening plays, JD.com including, I believe some of your lithium producers, they're in Billy Billy's down about 8.7 percent. That's on the back of it being removed essentially from from the index there. Reopening basket, we're down 4 percent in the opening minutes. By the way, in case you missed it, Hong Kong government issuing a statement about 2.5 hours back, Hong Kong leader John Lee tested positive for COVID. Okay, that's after his visit to Bangkok. All right, let's turn our attention back now. Of course, China. So short term, bullish long term, who knows, Ajay Kapoor is still with us here. Global research head of emerging market strategy at both of securities. I guess it's reminder viewers in case they missed a previous segment. You guys have torn, turned bullish short term. How long do you think that the next 12 months, 12 month call? Yeah, well, that's my view. And so that's why I call it a tactically constructive call. So it's not a few weeks or 20 percent. It's longer. Well, we're done with that already. Right. Exactly. So, but yeah, so it is about, let's say, call it six months or 12 months. As long as these measures are in place and get better and the credit cycle keeps improving. But yeah, long term, I retain my conservative views on China and the main reason is that the return on equity, which is currently about 11, 12 percent, could easily fall to 9 percent as the economy slows from 8 percent nominal to about 5 percent nominal. And more importantly, Chinese corporate leverage, the asset equity ratio is 3.5. It's the highest amongst all the markets we cover. And it used to be only 2.5 just 10 years ago. So they take that back down to the 10 year ago level and the economy slows. Then that ROE drops from 9 and 9.5 to about 7, which would make it the lowest in the world. And so obviously, if you're, if you go have an ROE of 7 percent or so, you should create a roundbook value. And so I think they are longer term headwinds for corporate China. Now, of course, they can turn that around if they raise their profit margins, if they become more innovative, more productive, they get more brand power and that they have a long runway in many new sectors that might emerge. So it's not all over. It just depends on we haven't been able to really identify what those new sectors might be. I think, you know, Winnie likes the EV sectors. You like some of the smaller industrial companies that might do very well. But that's more of a let's see how that progresses. Yeah, I can't help but make the well, 9 percent return on equity. What's that? Is it Japan? Yeah, well, that's Japan right now. And Japan's not the lowest in the world. There are very few countries that normally have an ROE less than 10 percent. There's just a handful. There's Hong Kong, Singapore, Belgium, Japan. So there's this very few. And within that basket, I guess, China relative to its where it is in its cycle of development should not be in single digits, what you're saying. No, because... That's what an EM is. Yeah, so I think people confuse economic growth with making money in equity markets. This is a very important point. So if you put a million dollars 30 exactly 30 years ago in the US, you'd have about eight and a half million now. In India, you'd have about seven to eight million. In Denmark, you'd have about nine to ten million. In China, you'd have six, fifty thousand. In other words, for 30 years, your returns have actually been flat to down, because countries, especially in Asia and emerging markets that are very capital intensive, they're very growth intensive. They can print great nominal GDP and sales growth, but they dial you to you through a lot of equity. They want more and more of your money to feed themselves. And so you as a shareholder tend not to make EPS growth earnings per share growth. And that's why your long-term returns in Asia and emerging markets have been very challenged. Right. And as a percentage of the EM basket, then what does that mean for if you have your money, say, an EM basket fund? Yeah. Because China is such a big part of that. Right. Yeah, it's about 30% or so. It used to be 40 plus. Yeah. So it's come off. And then Korean Taiwan and other 15 each. So that's about what, 60? And then India is about 15. So you've got 75 already with just four countries. Yeah. So the EM investing has been very challenging. So the only times you really make money in EMs is when the dollar is weakening, when China has a massive monetary cycle and or you've had a financial crisis and you're trading at book value. And so you're super very undervalued. Those are",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1365,2022-11-21 01:36:37
18752," When China has a massive monetary cycle and or you've had a financial crisis and you're trading at book value and so you're super very undervalued. Those are only the only three times you make money in EM's. What manages in your view to knock China off this sort of short, spurt cycle that's in? Because to your point, there are years when China does exceptionally well. You look at it over 30 years and it almost disappears. You wake up at any point and you're almost at the same index level. So how can they... Yeah, what can they do? Is that a regulatory? Is that a government initiative? Is it a corporate? Is it down to the corporates, for example? I think it's a question of we need better compounders. We need faster growth companies like you have in the US or Denmark or India. Because in China we do find these compounders in the A-share market but because the competition there is so immense, they don't hang around for too long. So I think as an economist you might like competition, as an investor it's not the best thing because you'd rather have monopoly or oligopoly power. Oh, yeah. Don't get there. Final question. Since we started off here talking about the reopening story in China, right? So the next 12 months, is there too much stimulus in this economy right now if they simply reopen? And that's a gradual process. I'm just trying to get a sense of where fiscal and monetary policy will be amidst this reopening story. Well, I mean the fiscal deficit has expanded dramatically because the economy is slow. So if you do a fiscal deficit to GDP type number, it's obviously does not look very good. And on monetary policy it has turned. I talked about your own index, a credit impulse. It has been improving for a while. The financial conditions have begun to ease. So yeah, I think they can do a lot. It's not a question of easy policy. The question is, is there loan demand at the other end? And so if you're a homeowner, well, you really want a new mortgage right now. If you're a capitalist, if you're an entrepreneur, there's so much uncertainty. And so I think it's not a question of how easy policy is. It's more how easy is these other policies like the COVID or the regulatory policies, which could revive the animal's spirits. I think that's what's required. And that's going to take more than 12 months. To recap your call though, over 12 months, we probably don't even need that because positioning has been extremely barriers. This is what you're saying here. Right. Yes. All right. Ajay, have a great week ahead. Thank you so much. Ajay Kapoor there. They've turned tactically bullish on China. Global head of, global research had there. If emerging markets strategy at both of the securities. All right. Let's get it over now to Vani Quinn. She is in New York and she has your first renews. Vani. David, thank you. China's first COVID-related deaths in almost six months are sparking concern that Beijing could see a return of heightened restrictions. The city says three people, elderly, died over the weekend from causes related to the virus. The first documented death, strong COVID, since May 26th. China reported more than 26,000 new cases for Sunday with a fresh lockdown ordered in a district of Guangzhou. Papua New Guinea's Prime Minister says Chinese President Xi Jinping has never expressed interest in a military base in the Pacific nation. Concern has been growing among the U.S. and its allies about Beijing's security interests in the region. Speaking exclusively to Bloomberg at the APEC summit in Bangkok, James Marappay said the two men had only discussed what they could do for business. Let me be open and can't wait. China for once has never, never expressed clearly the interest for military base or presence of the sort of nature in PNG, nothing about military, nothing about aid and grant. Turkey has carried out airstrikes against U.S.-backed Kurdish militant groups in Iraq and Northern Syria. The Defense Ministry says the raids were to eliminate what it called a terrorist threat and come after a deadly bombing that targeted civilians in Istanbul. The offensive could shore up flagging domestic support for Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan ahead of elections next year. Global news, 24 hours a day on air and on Bloomberg quick take, powered on more than 2700 journalists and analysts. In more than 120 countries, I'm Vani Quinn. This is Bloomberg. David. Right. Vani, we're coming off quite a very busy week and week and two as far as geopolitical politics and top level meetings are concerned here. So the Chinese President, Xi Jinping, started it, well, last week his first overseas trip mending ties with the U.S. and did though with you leaders certainly making the case here for a brief chance brethand for a destinations with U.S.-backed An frigid",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1366,2022-11-21 01:41:02
18753," The Chinese president, Xi Jinping, started, well, last week his first overseas tremendous ties with the U.S. ended, though, with you leaders certainly making the case here for resisting Washington's chip curbs in China. We'll put everything together for you right now. Bruce Einhorn, our Bloomberg reporter, is here with us. Let's start off with the Europeans. And that sort of middle ground. Is that a good way to describe it that they're trying to hit here? Perhaps. I think we have to wait and see where all this goes. But French President Macron did give a speech at the summit, the APEC summit on Friday, in which he did seem to indicate that that's sort of where the Europeans want to go with this. He said that a lot of people would like to see there are two orders in this world, and he said that this would be a huge mistake we need a single global order. So this reiterates comments that we heard from German Chancellor Schultz earlier this month when he was visiting Beijing. So there are signs that the Europeans are not completely on board with Washington's strategy of really pushing to isolate China as far as technology is concerned. The big players here are the Dutch, right? Because ASML is one of the world's largest semiconductor manufacturing. They make the equipment for Germany. That make the equipment, yeah, exactly. And so the question is, what are the Dutch going to do when it comes to imposing additional restrictions on ASML toward China? So the Dutch foreign trade minister has said, look, we're not going to just go do exactly what the Americans have done. But they are looking to tighten the minister said. And U.S. officials from Ministry of Commerce are going to be going to the Netherlands later this month, or maybe next month, sometime soon, to have talked with the Dutch about just what they're going to do on this. So that's still an open question. And that will really go a long way to determining just what the Europeans will be doing when it comes to imposing additional restrictions on China. Right. Now on the American side of the equation here, there was a brief meeting with the U.S. Vice President with Xi Jinping. What has it to play? So Vice President Kamala Harris had a meeting with Xi Jinping at the APEC summit. This of course follows the big meeting between the two presidents earlier last week. The really interesting thing about this is it just gave Xi Jinping another opportunity to comment about that meeting with President Biden. And in his meeting with Vice President Harris, Xi Jinping did talk about the positive results that came out of this meeting. So another sign that there's potential here for a little bit of an easing in U.S.-China relations. All right, Bruce. Thank you so much. Rapping up quite a bit there. Bruce Einhorn on all things geopolitics here. Now also taking place over in APEC, obviously, we had a conversation here with the IMF-MG, Kristalline and George Yebel here talking about trade barriers against China and other countries could actually cost the global economy. Get this. $1.4 trillion. Now, she also said that nations need to avoid divisions as they face the fallouts of multiple crises. Have a look. In a difficult time for the world economy, this part performs better. But to sustain growth would require overcoming fragmentation that is a big threat to the world today. Theresa Mitz, one message. We must work together because we are in a world that is going from one shock to another. Pandemic inflation. If we add on top of it the fragmentation in the world economy, it would be throwing gasoline on a fire. Nobody benefits from it. How concerned are you though? The prolonged isolation of China's economy might even be more prolonged and there will be potentially, we've seen it in the property sector, we've seen defaults, we've seen job losses. Are these headwinds insurmountable if this goes on too long? What they're significant and what I'm hoping to see is some reversal in policies.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1367,2022-11-21 01:45:12
18754," Too long? They are significant and what I am hoping to see is some reversal in policies about towards China and globally. The world is going to lose 1.5% of GDP just because of divisions that may split us into two trading blocks. This is $1.4 trillion. For Asia, the loss is much more significant because Asia is so integrated in global value chains. It could be 3% or more. Let's talk about inflation. Your managing director, Gita Gopinath, told us that the Bloomberg New Economy Forum in Singapore that there have been false dawns on inflation possibly easing before. Are there particular economies in the world where you worried that they might reverse tackling inflation too soon? I am not worried about the United States. Let me start from that because the US economy is the most important in that regard. The Fed is going to state the course for as long as it takes to bring inflation down to the market. In Europe, the situation is more difficult. Why? Because there, the impact of the war in Ukraine is significant. Half of the European Union at least would be in recession next year. It would put pressure on the European Central Bank to ease conditions. I was relieved to hear my predecessor, Cristina Lagarde, saying we are not going to do that. But the politicians in Europe may be more vocal in trying to get relief before it is time to do so. You have to go, but is there anything else you wanted to say? You have us on camera right now. Have you on camera? The very best message I have heard in this three summits was President Jokovy. This war must end. The single most damaging factor for the world economy is the war. And if we want to return to growth, the sooner the war ends, the better. The IMF boss, they are speaking with our colleagues, Stephen Engel. Just ahead here, we are talking elections.

Elections over the weekend here, and they have until 2 p.m. political leaders here to inform the king of their choice of prime minister. Juliette Sali joins us right now from KL. Juliette, bring in sector speed. Yeah, David, the fourth prime minister in as many years and many were hoping this selection would be a lot smoother than it is. Malaysia's first hung parliament we are facing now with a lot of deal making you would expect to happening until that 2 p.m. deadline to form the government and inform the king. So we have 75 year old opposition leader Andwa Ibrahim and his Pakistan Harapan party. He's claiming he does have the majority to form an alliance and actually win a government and become and really realize his dream of becoming a prime minister of Malaysia. But then you also have the former president, Mouyette and Yassin and the pro Islamic PN party which many people we have been speaking to this morning say is more likely to form a coalition with the former ruling BN which is led by Umno and of course the caretaker prime minister ismalsabri Jakob who called this election early really hoping to capitalize on the opposition's weakness and probably not expecting the big vote count that Andwa Ibrahim's opposition party got they do actually have 82 seats already they need 111 to form a government and also worth noting Dave the longest ruling prime minister of Malaysia Mahatya Muhammad at 97 he lost his Lanqawi seats so ending his political career. Jules, what was the dominant concern among voters and you know when you answered a question also framed that for us and as far as you know the young voters that came as new voters in this election what was important to them were they a swing factor here? Yeah absolutely almost six million new voters because they lowered the voting age from 21 to 18 they were really about economic stability about political integrity trying to put the 1MDB scanner which dominated the 2018 vote behind them and like everywhere in the world David it's about these rising food costs when you have Malaysians unable to meet their monthly basic needs when you have many living below what the Malaysian Central Bank says is enough money to survive on and of course these rising food costs as well and they've been driven up by the fact that you've got higher import fees you've got demand from overseas remember at one point Malaysia actually stopped the export of chickens to Singapore to try and protect its own national food security as well so it really is about the economy that has driven many people to the polls with a pretty strong turnout 73% of the 21 million registered voters headed to the polls according to the latest data on Saturday Dave.

A at least a dozen employees have accused EV maker Rivian of safety violations at its plant in Illinois. A complaint filed with federal regulators say the company ignored these known hazards and a list of injuries. In a statement the company disputes that these allegations say that creating a safe environment is part of its operating procedures. It's both first and declined to comment on those specific complaints. Now an examiner has found bankrupt crypto lender, Celcius Network, was lacked in its crypto custody across two services making it difficult to determine how users will actually be reimbursed. The examiner's report found Celcius launched custody without adequate control. Now this withhold program also made no effort to segregate its assets. Right. Brief look across this pullback is one way to describe it. A bunch, depending on where you sit on the statistically material spectrum on Z scores. We are coming off lows of today, though, across most of these benchmarks, every single stock with the exception of one on Hang Seng China index is down. Bank of China is basically unchanged with the rest of China's assets. You can see also pulling back here. We'll have a look in closer detail what the latest COVID situation is in China. Certainly lots of developments here, but in case you need a snapshot, here we go for you guys here. We have Beijing reporting, three deaths over the weekend, Guangzhou is locking down. One of its district for five days, I believe starting today, Chongqing declaring individual higher risk areas and arguably the biggest one is Shujia Zhuang here, asking all its residents to stay home. We'll talk about this in just a few moments with a lot of big guests coming up. We're talking crypto, we're talking politics, and we're all strong clean energy with all the big names just ahead. I'll look at Shanghai, which I'm one and a half percent, this is Bloomberg. Nutruring also can come from men and it's one of the qualities I guess that you found in your mentors that also pushed you up. Do we need even more nurturing post pandemic? Is the way that we talk with employees going to change? I think talent becomes the single biggest differentiator of a successful entity versus the most successful. So you've got to do everything possible, to hire, train, retain, put your arms around talent. You really got to focus on your talent. In the past it's always been given money, show them that they have upward mobility and can make even more money and that's the only reason people come to world.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1370,2022-11-21 01:58:10
18757," In the past, it's always been given money. You know, show them that they have upward mobility and can make even more money and that's the only reason people come to world. I think post-pandemic, we're seeing more and more people say, I have to worry about me as a person, I have to worry about my family, I want to worry about my well-being, my mental health. So we've got to start encompassing people as holistic humans as opposed to the tool of the train, which means that we have to engage with the head, heart and hands. Not just head and hands, the heart has been engaged. So we have to be sure more empathy, show that we care that their citizens and the community, their members of the family, and all of those have to come into consideration as we help an executive or an employee, be an employee and be opposed to the community and the family. His stakes are higher. What do you think of when you think of a battery? For most, it's what we use to power devices for both work and play and maybe even your car. Over the past few decades, they've gotten way more powerful, long-lasting and affordable. But all of this is just a prologue to what the next battery's going to do. As we drive to an increasingly renewable power-driven grid, we also need to be able to store energy and release it later to cover those periods of weather intermittencies that are driving this new grid that we're in. It's a multi-trillion dollar opportunity and it's imperative that we figure out the solution here. How we store energy on a massive scale is in many ways the central challenge of the fight to stop climate change. When US jobs numbers are released, Bloomberg brings you crucial data at terminal speed and instant expert analysis. Nobody covers jobs day like Bloomberg. It's almost 10 AM here in Hong Kong in Singapore, 11 AM if you're watching out of Tokyo. Welcome to Bloomberg Market's Asia. I'm David with Rish. Right, okay. We're concerned Beijing may return to stricter virus restrictions after China reports its first COVID-related deaths in almost six months. Those fierce switching sentiment to take risk off across Asian markets. The Hang Seng Index falling the most since the 3rd of November plus the clock ticking for Malaysia's political parties to come up with a viable government. After Saturday's vote produced a hung parliament. We do have 25,000 cases of course. In China we've got that certainly the moment to creating all sorts of risk factors. With the sentiment toward Chinese investing just having changed. It was almost palpable David. On top of that we've got no change in the loan. We're looking forward to the Fed minutes as well this week. Yeah, the UK decision that's also coming up. Inflation numbers at Hong Kong today. Visitor numbers at Macau. A lot to sink your teeth into in the meantime. As the risk is pointing out here, souring of risk sentiment. Just keep in mind that we're just coming off of 20-30% gains here. Month to date this month on some benchmarks here. There isn't reason to take money out the table consolidate. Taking profits as they say. 1.1% down here. On the Asia Pacific benchmark. Commodities are down. As you can see the dollar is bid. We'll talk about Malaysia in just a moment. But the ring it as you can see. There's 7.10% of 1% to the downside. So that's normally something you don't see. The ring it moved by that much. The one is also down about 1%. So it's a strong dollar story. Just to wrap all the news. And there's a lot of news as far as the COVID-19 is concerned here in China. So Beijing, first death's rich. Plus, of course, several cities very much in focus, including, of course, what's been happening over in Chongqing here. Yeah, also, let's not forget that we've got those Fed meds. Be okay, as you said. EU energy meeting. Ministers meeting as well, of course, as we have this cold winter, possibly in prospect. Energy security going to be top of the agenda of.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1371,2022-11-21 02:02:34
18758," As you said, EU Energy Meeting, Ministers Meeting as well, of course, as we have this cold winter, possibly in prospect, energy, security going to be top of the agenda, of course, given what's happening in Ukraine. Black Friday, David, as well. So it's certainly taken focus, and we have the loan primate. And there we go. There's a look at all the different Thailand GDP. That's in just under half an hour from now, looking at 4.5% growth in the third quarter, and that would be a significant increase from the second quarter where we saw 2.5% expansion take place. All right, Malaysian politics. And leaders in the country have a two o'clock this afternoon to inform the king of their choice of prime minister. That's after Saturday's vote produced. The country's first ever, hadn't Parliament, the Malaysian opposition leader Anway Ibrahim says, he has the numbers to form a government, but it may be at the cost of having to forge a deal with a long time nemesis. Juliette Sali joins us now live from the capital, quite a lump of Juliette. What do we know this hour? Yeah, absolutely rich Malaysians are wanting to elect their fourth prime minister in as many years, probably won't expect it to be this complicated, but we can expect that there would be a lot of deal making going on ahead of that 2 p.m. deadline to inform the king and form the new government. So you do have the 75-year-old opposition leader, Anway Ibrahim, and his reformist, Pakistan Harapan party. They have 82 of the 111 seats needed, and then you have the former premier, Mahir and Yassin, and his Malays, or pro-Islamist party, P and they have 73 seats, and they are probably more likely to form an alliance with the caretaker prime minister, Ismail Sabri Yakhob, and the BN coalition, which is 113 out of the past 15 elections. So that government, if they do form that alliance, would basically be like what we've had in the previous government, but with a different prime minister. But of course, Anway Ibrahim really trying to realize his dream of becoming Malaysia's prime minister, and he is adamant that he is doing the deal making needed to get to that 111 seat majority by 2 p.m. this afternoon. So either way, you're going to have a government similar to what we've just had, or the more reformist, Anway Ibrahim party in charge there. And worth noting, Dave Rish, that 97-year-old Mahatim Aham had Malaysia's longest serving prime minister 22 years in his first rule. He lost his land car we see at the election. So ending his political career, James Chin from the University of Tasmania telling us earlier, tears and careers. Ah, yeah. Jules, we were looking at a list of issues going into these elections, as perhaps some of the dominant areas of concern from voters. Did those turn out to be the key areas of concern? Yeah, well, it was interesting that James Chin said to us that a lot of people that so far from the data that they've got the young people, they were actually going for the more conservative vote. But we did hear that there was a lot of concern about political stability, about political integrity, really trying to put these identity politics that have plagued Malaysia for so many years behind them. Remember that the former Prime Minister, and Sergeant Brasak, is in jail over the 1MDB scandal. And then, like everywhere, you have these rising cost of living pressures, the average minimum wage, 1,500 ring at a month, that's $329 US dollars. Malaysia's own central bank said back in 2018, you need 4,500 ring at for a couple, 6,500 a month if you have children to basically meet your monthly basic needs. And then you have these rising costs like chicken. Many people we spoke to over the weekend at wet markets and hawker centers saying they can't simply afford meat. So, of course, when you have all these pressures, that's really what's driving a number of people. And 73% of the 21 million people registered vote turned out to vote on Saturday and really try and cast their say, probably not expecting that it would come down to the wire like it has, Rich David. All right, counting down, of course, just under four hours to that deadline, 2pm, local time, Juliet Salley live for us there. Out of KL, I'm holding in my hand an RHB report, just put out, of course, on the back of this reaction, sue the uncharted waters as RHB frames this, perhaps short term negative here for investors here. Have a look at this. So, basically, it might create some uncertainty, this reopen, obviously, today we're cautious, trading ahead, and we're looking at things like, what will the cabinet look like, what this might mean for fiscal discipline, worst case scenario here for markets according to RHB. Right, let's find out what others...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1372,2022-11-21 02:06:58
18759," into things like what will the cabinet look like? What does what this might mean for fiscal discipline? Worst case scenario here for markets according to RHB, right? Let's find out what's others think about what to place here. Joining us now, Arkeal is Lee Hong-ung, head of investment at Opus Asset Management. Good morning. Thanks for joining us. Your initial reaction, ma'am, to what happened over the weekend. I must say it is not something that is unexpected, but I definitely was hoping for a better outcome, I must say. Lee Hong-ung, you have the uncertainty of politics. Do you then create more uncertainty on markets? What's your overall impression? Of course, we're talking short term here. Yeah, I think short term, we would expect quite a lot of volatility. In fact, this morning we can see that the gold market use has gone up about five, ten basis points, a good words later, and stock market is down. But it is expected because there is so much uncertainty on what the government is going to be like, and who is going to form the government. And this could be a couple of weeks, two weeks or even more. But of course, this is short term. In the long term, I think the Malaysian market has always shown that it is more influenced by what happens in the global market, the global economy and the fundamentals. But definitely, once the government for is formed, people will be looking at who the government is and whether there are a lot of policy changes. Although at this moment, I think the policy changes may not be too different from the government that we had, just previously. They're saying, what sort of combination is more market friendly, which ones likely to create more certainty and indeed more positivity looking ahead? I would say that either one, two or half will have some policies that will be market friendly in the short term. However, in the long term, I think that is where probably global investors or even local investors will be looking at. And I would say between both parties, it may not be too different in terms of what market is considered friendly. But in terms of stability, definitely, if you have a bigger collation, that would be giving a better stability. I think that is what market would want to look for. If you have stability, that would itself be market friendly. Right. Now, I want to get your sense of, this goes under, of course, your purview right now, in terms of fiscal policy, do you expect this incoming government to deviate from the previous ones plans, of course, when it comes to the budget? I really hope no, because I think the previous plans were still trying to aim for fiscal consolidation, a better discipline investment although, it is still very much expansionary. But you can see that in terms of the outlook and even rating agencies' perception, it is actually quite positive. And that is really what we hope for, although there is a possibility that, if you have quite an unstable government, then there will be more populist measures. That would actually be afraid of this fiscal consolidation going forward. Final question, the yield curve short end is at about 3.8. I think while you mentioned we're up five to 10. Long is at about 4.6. Where do you think the most value is along that's?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1373,2022-11-21 02:11:06
18760," Final question, the yield curve short end is at about 3.8. I think while you mentioned we're up 5 to 10. Long is at about 4.6. Where do you think the most value is along that sovereign curve? Like I said, the market will ultimately follow the fundamental of the economy and also the global economy direction. And therefore we feel that currently the short end has some value. As well as the long end, if you are more long term, because I think there is going to be a lot of volatility both dramatically and also on the external side as well. And therefore, the long end will be subject to more volatility. But if you are long term, there is value there in the long term, especially with our view that going into next year, especially second half of next year, economies slow down will start to see the yield curve start to flatten a bit. But as it is, I think the short term has price in pretty much whatever interest rate height there is going to be. And therefore we do see a value there, especially if we are talking about going to the objective of this income, having a recurrent and stable income and looking beyond the price movement. I think the income now is actually very attractive in terms of the fixed income market. Deepak, thank you so much for joining us early. I'm from Opus Asset Management. And Dr. Figke, we get to see PI inflation data off Friday out of Malaysia. Right, a situation in Europe where there are fears of radioactive fallout, let's get to Voddy Quinn in New York. She's got the first word news. Yeah, we're talking about Zamparija, Rich, the UN's Atomic Agency says powerful blasts have shaken the area around the nuclear power plant. This includes more than a dozen on Sunday morning. The IAEA says some buildings and systems were damaged, but none critically. Ukraine's nuclear regulator says Russian forces struck the facility. But Russia's army issued a statement blaming Ukraine for the shelling. The IMF says the rise of trade barriers against China and other countries over the past year could cost the global economy $1.4 trillion. Fund managing director Cristina Giorgieva says the potential loss for Asia could be more than 3% of GDP because the region is more integrated into the global value chain. She wants Asian countries to work together to overcome fragmentation. The world is going to lose 1.5% of GDP just because of divisions that may split us into two trading blocks. This is $1.4 trillion. For Asia, the loss is much more significant because Asia is so integrated in global value chains. It could be 3% or more. The US and China have resumed formal talks on climate change. China's climate envoy says the two countries agree to discuss how to address the losses and damage developing nations are experiencing as a consequence of climate change. But he also said any new deal should mirror the power agreement. Global news 24 hours a day on air and I'll boomer a quick take powered by more than 2700 journalists and analysts in more than 120 countries. I'm Varni Quinn. This is boomer. Rich. Thanks for that on our boomer. Marcus is going to be asking ballet crypto founder, Bobby Lee, which crypto coins he thinks could be the next to fall in which will survive the recent FTX collapse.

18761," Now let's move on! I've always been a person who's just been attracted to hair. I like to sit and think and theorize how I can manifest these visions that I have for braiding and how I can take something that may seem like it's a line drawing in my mind and apply that to someone's scalp. We are the only culture that has hair that grows out of our head the way that it does. Anyone from the African diaspora is born with this amazingly curly hair that can be shaped into a variety of different ways of expression. I want black people to love themselves for how they naturally appear and also to appreciate the cultural practice is such as braiding that our ancestors have practiced for centuries.

Visit bso.org slash now where the music plays on. BSO season sponsor Bank of America. I think that it's hard to put your head around any narrative. Let's just be honest. We've had sort of a shift in our way in some sort of circulation fears moment. People were talking about that all day yesterday. BSO You're back with Bimba Marcus. This is a look at these depressed assets. Hankseng was down in excess of 3%. It's recovered somewhat but there is those usual suspects suppressing anybody who wants to take risk out there. On the way down and treasuries a bit firmer here as well. Shedding accelerated with the opening of greater China stocks here as well. Major indices pretty much deeply in the red. And of course part of that is all down to this Covid situation in China. Let's get over to greater China. See an executive editor, John Luf from Beijing. And M life started to just mark Crownfield starting with you, John. What's the situation on the ground right now like and how bad is it? Well, it's pretty challenging to rush at the moment. We've had a big uptick in infections. We've had almost a thousand new cases in Beijing today in Guangzhou. They've got more than 8,000 cases reported for Sunday. Obviously over the weekend we had the first death that China has had in almost half a year here in Beijing. And then on Sunday two additional deaths reported. A 91 year old woman and 88 year old man. So the question now seems to be with this uptick in infections with deaths starting to add up. Are officials going to continue oil with the easing that they set out with a few weeks ago? Mark, I'll bring you in here. How much of what's happening now is simply, I mean these markets are up 30 percent anyway this month alone. How much of that is because of the bad headlines or simply just repositioning? Obviously, people are a bit spooked when they see that China is going back into some kind of a lockdown by doing a large city near Beijing. Clearly, people are a bit unnerved about that. And as you said, market's been doing pretty well this month. So if you've got some money to locking, you're probably thinking this is a good excuse to do that. Just in case China is going to spread these lockdowns into other places around the country. So there's no prizes for being a hero when you see some negative headlines like that. And plus, we've got a lot of Fed speakers coming out this week and they're probably going to push back against the idea that one good CPI report means that everything has changed. They're probably going to want to make people a bit cautious because they've got right hikes to come. They haven't finished that job. So they don't want markets to get too overexcited before they're finishing their hard work on raising interest rates. So you put those two things together. Plus there was some soft South Korean export data as well today. All the incremental news is slightly negative.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1375,2022-11-21 02:19:58
18762," raising interest rates. So you put those two things together. Plus there was some soft South Korean export data as well today. All the incremental news is slightly negative. So there's no particular reason for people to add to any bullish positions they may have had starting the week. Mark, it also gives you some sense perhaps of the Britain this returning, but it also comes against his background where we've had more and more investment houses, and the big picture is being positive or mildly positive at least on returning to China to invest. Yeah, the big picture since since Xi Jinping got his third term, the big picture is that China is definitely turning for the better. The measures to help the property market are very significant. You can't doubt that the PBOC seems to be very concerned about liquidity in the market. The banks have got adequate money to compensate for any potential bad loans that they have on their books there. You're generally seeing more people talking about that the need to make sure that the economy rebounds well in 2023. So everything is pushing in the right direction. This matters related to COVID, maybe a short term problem for the market, but it probably isn't going to change the thinking in a long way. And all of this is happening when you have Chinese markets very under invested by the rest of the world. Clearly the data has shown that foreigners have been taking money away from China this year. And look at the valuations on a relative basis. China is still quite cheap compared to many major markets around the world. So the big picture is certainly favorable for China as long as they don't get too tough on the COVID lockdowns and scare everybody in the short term. Well, let's get the insight and John, I'll bring you in on that note. We were speaking earlier with Ajay Kapoor out of both and after two years, they've turned tactically bullish on China to Mark's point. Ajay mentioned, you know, 30% rally doesn't even get us close to neutral as far as positioning. So I'll get your sense of policy and COVID right now, people look at Hong Kong as perhaps the path forward for mainland China. Is that the right path to look at or do I look at some of the cities and developments that you mentioned earlier as perhaps not it not being a Hong Kong not being that not to look at? I think the things that we've seen over the weekend, the deaths, the uptick and infections, the cities that as Mark mentioned that have locked down Shujiao Dwarong Guangzhou. I don't think that changes the direction of travel that China is on. It's very obvious that the way that COVID policies are being executed are elucid and they used to be. I just give you an example, we had two infections in my apartment complex. Two months ago, they would have locked us all down. And so today, they've locked down the two buildings where those people lived and allowed everyone else to be. And so that's a marked change from the past and it would inevitably lead to more infections. And so I think the question now is as those infections come in, deaths begin to add up because that happens on a lag. Will that result in officials backing down from this opening? We just don't know yet. And as we've heard from Xi Jinping, we had the former editor-in-chief of the Global Times calling on the government to continue opening even despite those deaths. And so right now, we still see a lot of momentum pushing forward though. I think the path forward will be extremely bumpy. John, thank you, John Leo, our greater China senior executive editor, Live First, out of Beijing and also joining us out of Singapore, our M Live contributor of course, Mark Cranfield there. Now let's just look at the data. So we've in fact had to look at this. And this is also by the way on one of our Bloomberg stories today. So we've looked at Metro ridership here. So Beijing, let's start Shanghai here. So normal is 2020. Big dip there of course, when nationwide almost the entire country was basically shut down. 2021 was at sweet spot. 2022, this is Shanghai specifically that locked down for about three, four months. This has been recovering. Chongqing though is a different story. 2020 is the same. 2021 is the same. 2022 is different because that's your new hotspot right now. This one has really come off substantially. And it's a similar picture in another hotspot very near Hong Kong. Of course, Guangzhou. Same thing here. 2020 plummet.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1376,2022-11-21 02:24:14
18763," This one has really come off substantially, and it's a similar picture in another hotspot, very near Hong Kong, of course, Guangzhou. Same thing here, 2020 plummets, 2021 was at Sweet Spot 2022, and this is a continuing story with Baoyun, which is a district that they locked down here for five days, I believe, starting today. There's plenty more ahead. This is Bloomberg. Happy Comes Over New Generation So let's go inside the boardroom. Let's suppose you win a proxy fight and or you just get invited on to the board. You go to your first board meeting and you're the person who's saying you can fix this company and all of the others on the board of directors are saying well we're doing pretty well. How do you get received when you start saying here is what I wanted you to do? Well first of all we don't bring that to the board. We're going to spend with the CEO, the chairman, the CFO and share our plans with them outside the board. We try never to solve an issue in a board. Okay it's always best done the day before the week before outside that. We wouldn't be there if they really were doing well. So it's really hard for them to straight face and tell us we're doing well. And we present them with a plan. All right it's just to get you up to speed with our business flash headlines. Elon Musk allowing Donald Trump's Twitter account to be restored after users on the social media website voted 52% to 48% to allow the form of presidents return. Musk's decision coming at a time of turmoil inside Twitter sources tell Bloomberg that the billionaires considering firing more employees this time. The layoffs could target the sales and partnership side of the business. The financial times are putting the Chinese authorities are helping Foxconnry stuff its iPhone assembly lines. The Hinawan government reportedly ordering officials to recruit new workers for the iPhone maker while Foxconn raised wages and also offered bonuses. Foxconn suffered a worker exodus late last month amid a COVID-19 outbreak. Right. Have a look at what's going on with some of these reopening stocks now. Yeah, but the open up trade here. So we're looking at some of these names listed on the mainland here in Hong Kong and also in Korea, this backpedaling of the narrative. Let's make it clear, of course, on the back of obviously some headlines coming through on the weekend there. So to varying degrees of bad. Okay. Lithium related stocks after China coming out asking producers, essentially signaling them to curb speculation their industry and also gd.com was out with earnings on Friday. A beat on revenue and a beat on profits. Crypto shares. We're looking at this fallout from FTX.

While Tesla's in the like make for good headlines, the reality is that even if every car on the roads today won't electric, it wouldn't be enough to curb global emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions from transportation account for about 29% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. So what about the other 71%? Buildings across America burn fossil fuels to operate. What we want to do is make that all electric. Instead of burning oil and gas to give us the energy and electricity we need, we want to do 100% clean energy, all electric. We want to turn buildings into Tesla's. Just like a Tesla or an electric vehicle is all electric with no fossil fuels, we want to do that with our buildings. If we can do it in one building, we can do it in all buildings. And if we do it in all buildings, we'll reduce 30% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. The game pure policy is just about nearly 1130. That's when of course the tech it goes off for. It's a lunch break. We are looking into just modest decline and also regionally speaking modest compared to others as well. Perhaps because the members of Japan's topics index are forecasting at 6. Nearly 7% gain in net income figures from the initial guidance they did provide. So just getting a boost there. Looking also at the YEN, which is trading pretty much flat on 140 right now, not changed. And also we've got stocks just under a bit of pressure. We've got certainly one of the companies helping to stop things falling back too far. OK, that's a look at those. Those are going to hang saying 2.4% down. OK, let's have a look now at what's going on with the first word news as we head over to New York and join Vony Quinn. Rich, thank you. Malaysian opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim Mand, former prime minister, Muid Niyasan, each say they have enough support from lawmakers to become the next prime minister. Saturday snap elections yielded the first hung parliament the country has seen. The king has given all political parties a deadline of 2pm Monday local time to tell him who will form the next government. Turkey has carried out airstrikes against the U.S. back to Kurdish militant groups in Iraq and northern Syria. The defense ministry says the raids were to eliminate what it called a terrorist threat and come after a deadly bombing that targeted civilians in Istanbul. The offensive could shore up flagging domestic support for Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan ahead of elections next year. Climate negotiators in Egypt have struck a deal that resets the relationship between rich and poor countries. Approved without a single opposing voice, the agreement creates a fund that helps developing nations face the devastation of climate change. Although the deal is an historic victory, negotiators fail to secure commitments for more ambitious cuts on greenhouse gas emissions. The world's biggest singles sporting event, soccer's world cup has begun in Qatar with a lavish opening ceremony.

18765," Global news. 24 hours a day on air and W.B.R. Quique take power by more than 2700 journalists and more than 120 countries. I'm Vony Quinn. This is Bluberg. David. All right. Yeah. Vony, thank you so much. I'm breaking news here. Some backward looking data out of Bangkok. You're banging line with estimates. Third quarter numbers. You're 4.5% median forecast. As I alluded to, 4.5% here. This is for the third quarter. All right. Make staying slightly in Thailand. Of course, at my event, sticking place, they're of course late last week. We're going to get into geopolitics now. Apec meeting in a wrap, of course, what happened over the weekend. Chinese president Xi Jinping started last week overseas. Mending ties with the U.S. and ended up with EU leaders essentially making the case here for resisting Washington's chip curves on China. That's bringing Bruce Einhorn. He's here with us to wrap all things for us. Let's start with the what we heard from the French, for example, when it comes to chips and that middle ground. Is that a good way to describe it again? So President Macron gave a speech on Friday at the Apec meeting in which he pushed back against this idea of decoupling and called for more engagement with China. So you look at that and you combine it with comments earlier in the month from German Chancellor Schultz along similar lines. And you can see some efforts perhaps by Europeans to go in the middle there trying to put a little bit of a distance between themselves and what Washington is proposing. But how far actually grew is it them perhaps detaching from Russia a little bit, which is then perceived as being moving towards Europe? Well, I think that the Europeans certainly are much more exposed to the all the economic repercussions of the war in Ukraine. And so they given that the the the way that they're trying to distance themselves from Russia, maybe they're less interested in also trying to distance themselves from China at the same time. I think it is worth noting first of all, you know, French President Macron made these comments. French presidents, of course, for you know, for decades have a history of trying to sort of strike a middle ground because they don't want to be seen as just being, you know, in line with the Americans completely. Also, the Dutch are big players here because ASMR is the big semiconductor, manufacturing equipment company. Another guys who make the equipment which allows people to make the equipment, the way they're going to make the equipment, the way they're going to make the equipment. So the question is, what will the Dutch do in terms of going going along with some of the restrictions that the U.S. has imposed on semiconductor manufacturing equipment going to China? The Dutch have said we're not going to just copy what the Americans are doing. That said, though, they all have said that they are going to look at this further. The U.S. is sending officials to the Dutch. We'll see some tightening from the Dutch just how far remains to be seen. The brief meeting between we started this off with President Xi Jinping. He met with a U.S. Vice President. Yes, so he met earlier in the week with President Biden. Then at the end of the week, he met with Vice President Harris, short meeting at the apex summit. But it did give President Xi an opportunity to talk more about his meeting with Biden, which did raise hopes that there was going to be some sort of a fall in U.S.-China relations. And indeed, President Xi did have positive things to say when meeting President Harris about his meeting with President Biden. So if people are looking for signs that maybe things are going to calm down a little bit between the U.S. and China, they take heart from what President Xi said in his meeting with Vice President Harris. Bruce, good stuff. Thank you very much for your time, Hongdae. Just looking at what's going on. And with perhaps a change of tone coming out of Beijing more than anything else. Right? We're going to have a look at Papua New Guinea Spiderman is saying the Chinese President Xi Jinping has never expressed interest in a military base in its country. Beijing has been looking to beef up security interests in the Pacific, and it's of course alarmed the United States and its regional allies. James Marapi spoke exclusively with our very un-steven angle. Let me be open and can it China for once has never, never expressed clearly the interest for military base or presence of the sort of NATO in P&G. P&G, and even, he had me clearly also.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1379,2022-11-21 02:37:22
18766," Trebasis, the presence of the sort of nature in P&G, he had me clearly also. Yesterday's conversation was the presence of the CGP for instance. All conversations in the good 20 minutes we spoke just on what they could do for business for us. Nothing about military. Nothing about military. Nothing about aid and rent. You know, made reference to passport, under my watch I'm saying aid and rent is okay. But I am more about you buying my produces. You bring investors in. So, China state cleared those conversations. Are you concerned though by the politicization of this region and that the competing superpowers are perhaps seeing you as in between competing visions for this part of the world? I'm concerned and the past week is concerned but I think finding the mutual ground for respect upon each other is important and I was happy at APEC as well as at G20. The global big leaders met and they talked. It's a first step in the right direction, talking and understanding. We may not change each other's worldview overnight but there's a place for tolerance and there's a place for securing a better future for the entire children of our planet if not now for the future going forward. What is the risk of possible militarization of this part of the world? I don't think there will be any other nations coming into the Pacific for instance for military presence. It is up to our leaders in the region to call for military presence if need be but our specific wireless relations with international health guide and PNG the context has no desire and neither has China proposed for instance. They have not. To have a military race in PNG. Is there any dialogue on the security pact with China? Not at the stage. No conversation. And that was a Prime Minister, Paul Ponyugini, speaking with our Stephen Engel. It's just ahead investors continue to pull funds and certainly confidence is wanting here out of digital asset exchanges here despite getting reassurances that things are stable. ballet crypto founder Bobby Lee will be joining us next in a couple of minutes. This is one work. I'm going to try to resonate just how sensitive the markets are to any commentary about trade. We did see pressure on the U.N. and we did see some pressure on the futures. That is now being reversed. Hold on for dear life, right? H-O-D-L crypto out of bed this morning here. In fact, I'm reading a tweet from Bobby Lee. It is out 20 hours ago.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1380,2022-11-21 02:41:36
18767," something that maybe crypto platforms might look like after this tier point of regulation. So the global financial crisis, that was a big issue for the whole global, the equity market and all that. For crypto, you know, in relatively speaking, this is not quite at the level of GFC. We would need, you know, FTX was a large exchange, but it wasn't the largest, you know, there are many large exchanges out there and we would need something of a much larger scale to truly be comparable. So despite that, I think this is going to set the industry back by a year or two in terms of a bear market, like what we call crypto winter. So it's, yeah, it's, it's, you know, I've been used to this in the last 11 years. I've been in crypto. I've seen this happen three or four times. But so Bobby, what I was trying to get to there was, how do we address bad behavior? Oh, to address bad behavior, we need better regulation. We need governments and regulators around the world to embrace crypto and be willing to go in and regulate. I think all these past, you know, five, six years, regulators have been tip-toning. There's been fighting a month's regulators, which ones are going. For example, in the US, we have the SEC and the CFTC, both trying to go regulate crypto and crypto, regulate Bitcoin and Ethereum. And it's, it's hard when there's no rule set. That's what happens when, for example, if you don't have good regulation and makes it very risky for companies to do business in the US, that's why you have exchanges operating offshore in Thai-Sing US customers. And then they also have so-called subsidiaries in the US. But the reality is these exchanges, global exchanges are all operating in offshore, you know, islands or small countries that give favorable regulation. So what we need is for the US regulators to acknowledge that crypto is for real and to put in, put down solid rules and welcome the countries, the companies to come in, but in a way that they can work together and make it work out for consumers, businesses and governments alike. Bobby, okay, with that regulation, I mean, don't forget there was SBF as well, who was asking for more regulation. God knows why. The thing is, didn't get these institutional plays, some of these old names on Wall Street getting interested in crypto and they have been, but not to hold it necessary, but to trade it. And that's where you make the money. Yeah, so what's the question about regulation? What's the question? I didn't get that. I'm asking you whether the institutions and the old names on Wall Street, when they are becoming more accepting of crypto, are they only really interested in trading it and making money from trading it rather than actually holding it? For sure, for sure, the traditional firms, they all want more trading volume, they all want to make commission and profits off of that. That's a given, right? I think crypto as an asset to hold, it's still going to take some time for the market to accept, you know, for me and others in the crypto industry, we hold Bitcoin, we hold Ethereum, we hold as a long-term asset class investment, but for many of the newcomers, they see it as a short-term trade, as a high volatility, they put money in, they can make money, but many people learn the hard lesson. In the last 12 months, crypto has crashed, has crashed some over 50% and some over 80%. So it's a tough learning lesson. We really have to have long-term vision to understand crypto and the value of it as a long-term asset class. So Bobby, for retail investors, traders, what do they, what should they take away from this as far as ensuring safety of their holdings is concerned? That gets us into everything from cold wallets to what have you, Bobby? Yeah, name that list for us. Yeah, so the most important thing for crypto is that the most revolutionary thing for crypto is that it is a bare asset, it's a digital bare asset, it means that you can hold it yourself. So unlike treasury bonds and like stocks where you have an account, those are titled assets, you have an account, and the custodian holds it for you, there's no choice for you to, this practically no choice for you to hold stocks and bonds and all that at home, right? So, but with crypto, you can actually hold crypto yourself, there's expression, be your own bank. Through the use of cryptography, private keys, you can have title and have asset, hold the asset.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1381,2022-11-21 02:49:06
18768," actually hold crypto yourself. There's expression, be your own bank. Through the use of cryptography, private keys, you can have title and have asset hold the asset yourself. And this is through the use of self-custody wallets such as cold storage. And my company, Ballet, we do off of this solution. So I encourage everyone to take your money off of exchanges, to take your crypto off of exchanges once you buy the crypto, you should hold it yourself as best as you can. And then don't deposit your money on crypto exchanges unless you plan to buy or sell. If it's not in motion of being traded, it should be held offline in cold storage. Bobby, thank you very much indeed. Great talking to you as ever. Bobby Lee, the fan on CEO of Ballet Crypto. Just got some news coming out of the Walt Disney company, Disney and you see here their Bob Iga. Now he was of course the chairman before, till 2021, end of 2021. He is succeeding Bob Chapack there as well. So Robert Iga, or Bobby Grasies known, is becoming chief executive of that storied company. There we go. That's a look at that. And more on the way. This has been Big. I'm going to go to the next one. I'm going to go to the next one. You've got to explain this one to me.

And we have about just over three hours from now, Rish, to that deadline from the king. Yep, three hours, ten minutes, to be precise. Yeah, I go. Okay, well, indeed, let's have a look at the opposition leader here as well. Because there's Anwar Ibrahim fighting out with the ex-premium Mohi Adin Yesin, competing to form that next government. We had an unprecedented hung parliament. And of course, we've got this talk clicking here, ticking even towards that deadline set by the king. Let's get a quite a little bit. Juliette Sali is there with our next guest. Jules. I am indeed a reassuring. We have the former Amno Chief Information Officer Shaheerl Hamdan with me. Commiserations about not winning on Saturday. But tell us where you see the end standing now as we are hearing that some of your party are meeting with Anwar Ibrahim. And also, Pian to try and form an alliance here. I think the first thing to say is that there's going to be a huge overhaul and reform process needed. Something we said four years ago, but failed to do adequately. And to the point about where we go from here in the immediate 24-48 hours, however many hours are left before we see what our role is, post elections in the formation of a new government. My sense of that discussion shouldn't be led by the party president. And I've made my views clear.

18769," I want to run it for the next 10, 15, 20 years or do you? And if you didn't, would you want to go into government if the president called you to serve our country? Would you go into government? Or would you start another company? I love what I do. And I feel like I have this luxury with 23 me that it's keeps evolving. We started out just as a start out of consumer company. We're thick in research. We got into drug discovery in 2015. And now we're getting to the delivery of care. So I've been really lucky with 23 me that it's been endlessly interesting. And I'm surrounded by incredibly talented, brilliant individuals where I learn from them. And what I always advise people to do is you should take jobs where you're learning. And if you stop learning in the job, then you should quit. And frankly, when people leave 23 me, I say, if you're not learning anymore, you should move on. So I'm 100% committed to 23 me. That said, my other passion is other direct to consumer. Like I want to build out a true consumer-empowered health care world, one that is outside of the existing system. And I do, there's no greater force than government. What do you think of when you think of a battery? For most, it's what we use to power devices for both work and play, and maybe even your car. Over the past few decades, they've gotten way more powerful, long-lasting, and affordable. But all of this is just a prologue to what the next batteries are going to do. As we drive to an increasingly renewable power driven grid, we also need to be able to store energy and release it later to cover those periods of weather intermittencies that are driving this new grid that we're in. It's a multi-trillion dollar opportunity, and it's imperative that we figure out the solution here. How we store energy on a massive scale is in many ways the central challenge of the fight to stop climate change.

Those fears, switching sentiment to risk off Hong Kong socks falling the most in three weeks. And then Macau Casino's gauge is tumbling 6%. Plus, the clock ticking from a lazy political party is to come up with a viable government to settle a vote produced a hung parliament. Straight at the market action, it is that COVID picture of the moment, depressing what's happening, and regionally speaking, we're seeing these markets just suffering because of that, we're looking at stock-stropping back, not just on the basis of this increase in number of COVID cases in China, and indeed the first COVID-related death in almost six months. We also have South Korean data, which is a little bit soft when it came to trade. And of course, we have also the outlook of interest rate moves and monetary policy from the Federal Reserve's all dampening down at the moment, sentiment, if you will.

18771," The moment the start of the trading day, that is as expected, given what's happening at the moment. But we did have GDP numbers which came in bang in line with estimates. The Thai economy expanding of the fastest rate in more than a year. All really down to the recovery of tourism. We also can see consumption come back. Even though we've got price pressures remaining elevated, GDP up 4.5% in the latest quarter there as well. This is essentially bang in line with the expectation of that from the economists that we had surveyed as well. It also does confirm the bank of Thailand's view that the economy is taking off as it were. Looking at what's happening in India as well because with the prospects of the trading day, there are 44 minutes away from the start of the session, nifty pointing down its futures down by about half of 1%. It is really again in line with the region and there we go. The repeat, steady. 81 rupees 68 pesa. I just mentioned within these Chinese markets, indeed, greater China markets really feeling it from this Covid related death. The first Covid related deaths, I should say, in almost six months. It does all spark off concerns about a return to heightened restrictions in the country. Let's get over to China's senior executive editor, John Liu from Beijing. John, how is it all evolving on the ground? And how are these fears manifesting themselves currently? Well, the way they've manifested is we've seen increased restrictions here in Beijing where we had the first death on Saturday and almost half a year. We've seen schools close, we've got businesses closed. Residents in Beijing's Chaian District, where the number of infections has been highest, have been asked to stay in that district not to leave unless they have to. In other places in Guangzhou, for example, we've had more than 8,000 cases reported for Sunday. One district of Guangzhou has been locked down in another city, Shujadrong. Residents there are being asked to stay at home and there is being mass testing rolled out again to several districts of that city. So you are seeing some of the old playbook coming back in after the opening began about a week ago. John, I mean, you talk about that opening, but this has been quite a tragic story. So what do you think it means now for perhaps the elongation of some of these COVID-19 policies? The fact that China now faces this test of its resolve, I don't find surprising, I think, when the country started down this path to rolling back some of these COVID-19 restrictions, inevitably we're going to come to a point where infections were going to rise and with a greater number of infections, there were going to be deaths now. I think what we want, what we're waiting to see is how much resolve does the government have to continue to keep at it, even with infections rising, even with deaths being reported, will they continue to open? All right, great. A China senior executive editor, John Liu, with us in Beijing. Let's head to New York now and get the first word news with Bonnie Quinn. Hey, Bonnie. Hey, Julia, thanks. Good morning. Malaysian opposition leader, Anwar Ibrahim, and former Prime Minister, Mou Yuden Yassan, each say they have enough support from lawmakers to become the next Prime Minister.

She wants Asian countries to work together to overcome fragmentation. The world is going to lose 1.5% of GDP just because of divisions that may split us into two trading blocks. This is 1.4 trillion dollars. For Asia, the loss is much more significant because Asia is so integrated in global value chains. It could be 3% or more.

18773," Perhaps with we are looking at the moment we can get more on the possible return of heightened restrictions and what they mean for markets, M life strategies, Mark Cranfield joins us now Mark. What's the chief fear here as of course in the background in recent weeks perhaps we've seen a more positive view of China as an investment opportunity reappear? Yeah of course traders will be concerned that China might be going backward. Recently there have been some signs that they were easing various ways on the COVID-19 policy which is part of the reason why equities have done so well this month. Obviously it's also related to the property sector where the Chinese authorities have made some big measures to try and stabilize property as well. It's not too surprising that you get a bit of a knee jerk reaction today when you get some negative reports about COVID lockdowns which we haven't seen for some time when we're expecting them to take an easier policy and trade us, I've probably built up some long positions in the past couple of weeks so it's no surprise really that they they want to pull back on that and plus this week is is a bit of a strange week. You've got a lot of fed speakers, you've got FOMC minutes and you've got the Thanksgiving holiday in the United States so it's going to be a bit of a erratic week anyway. So people that want to do things probably need to pull it out of the way very early in the week. Well Mark let's get to what we are expecting this week because it's also a busy week in terms of central bank decisions here in Asia as well and the RBNZ could actually come out with their sixth straight 50 basis point hike. Well some people are actually calling for 75 which will be pretty dramatic and you can see the the cross-street between the Aussie and Kiwi has moved quite a bit in the past couple of days in favour of the New Zealand dollar which suggests that traders see a decent chance of a 75 basis point hike which will be in contrast to the RBA who are probably only going to do 25 basis points. So that would certainly create quite a bit of excitement in the foreign exchange market whether they go through with 75 or not even 50 would still be pretty sizeable rate hike as you as you mentioned but either way the Kiwi dollar is clearly going to be a bit of an out performer on a relative basis because New Zealand is still pushing hard with rate hike when some other countries that are showing signs that they're getting close to the end or that they're ready to to be a bit softer on the on the rate hike front. So certainly the New Zealand dollar stands out for the highest amount of attention this week and if they do go 75 basis points and it comes with a hawkish outlook then we really could see some significant moves in the foreign exchange market this week. Tell me Mark how far is the softer than anticipated trade data out of South Korea playing into the narrative today? It was certainly a factor because over the weekend there wasn't really anything substantial which came out on the risk front so what we've had this morning is we've had some negative news from China around lockdowns and we've had some week South Korea and exports as well so you put those two together it certainly gives people a reason to start the week with some real Monday blues and Korean exports are quite a good leading indicator of when we're starting to see softness in Asia in general so the whole of the Asian region you can see most Asian currencies are underperforming quite badly today as well the Thai Bartminesian Ringgit also with their election as well Korean one obviously in there as well so certainly South Korea and exports are a factor and if we don't see a quick improvement on that front then we could see Asian currencies lagging for a while against their major currency peers. All right we're talking about Asian currencies I know the M-live team asking that question today about whether on the dollar you aren't has peaked what are you hearing? Yeah I think most people are still happy with the view that we're in a bit of a trading range for dollar you aren't we may not see the highs again around the 732 area I think most traders and analysts they buy into the idea that China is starting to turn the corner in terms of the government is more focused on getting the economy going since Xi Jinping was confirmed for his third term as president of course there's going to be some near term volatility partly because of what happens offshore partly because what the Fed is doing and whether the Fed go ahead with another big rate hike in December as well but in terms of",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1387,2022-11-21 03:15:11
18774," and the return volatility partly because of what happens offshore, partly because what the Fed is doing and whether the Fed go ahead with another big rate hike in December as well. But in terms of their major currency moves, I think generally the view is that the US dollar is is peaking and that we're going to see a gradual downtrend for the US dollar, which would include the dollar you want exchange rate as well. All right. Bloomberg's Mark Crownfield with us from Singapore. Thanks as always. Well, investors will be also looking as Mark has mentioned two minutes from the most recent Fed policy meeting for more clues on the course of rate hikes. Let's bring in Wayne Gordon. Executive director for commodities and effects at UBS Global World Management and just kind of want to follow up there on what Mark was saying, Wayne, about whether or not we have seen the dollar peak. Good morning, guys. We think that the dollar is going to be stronger into the end of the year and largely that's because we believe that the market has got a little bit of end of itself with respect to when the Fed could start to signal and easing of the policy hikes if not a pause in their policy hikes. That's very clear to us from the Fed speakers that we've heard so far over the last week and we think that that would be reiterated as we go forward into this week. Hence, we would expect that you will see the euro dollar, for example, back below parity and as a consequence, you will see some of the crosses begin to come under pressure again after some pretty strong rallies over the last couple of weeks. Wayne, we would do want to get your thoughts on the Fed, but I also want to ask you about the complication that we've seen from China's COVID cases, which is very much danting market sentiment today and when in your view we see potentially an end to COVID zero and I guess some more market stability. Yeah, we've looked at this in pretty great detail and I guess from our perspective it's early quarter three next year when we expect a meaningful reopening in China. I guess it comes down to, you know, how do you define what is a meaningful reopening from our perspective? We believe that at least we define this as the end to these sort of lockdowns that we continue to experience on a fairly regular basis over the last six months or so. Clearly the market has rallied a lot and we saw, for example, Chinese equities rallying around 20% over the last month and that was on the back of some of these more optimistic announcements by the government, et cetera, on starting to look at how do we move towards the end of these lockdowns through the start of next year. From our perspective there are a few key points that people need to watch out for. Firstly, that is the changing narrative from the government and the media in China. The second thing from our perspective is that sort of building out of the surge capacity in hospitals and so forth and also continuing to focus on hitting those higher levels of vaccination, particularly in older citizens, into next year. So indeed the announcements have been very positive. We think that it's a step forward, but there are going to be setbacks along the way and investors need to be cognizant that this is not a straight road out. Wayne, I suppose this year is the date we change everything was February the 24th when the Russian troops crossed the Ukrainian border. How will the energy equation resolve itself and how far our energy price is already factoring in a cold winter in Europe? I think that energy prices at the moment actually Russia very much in the reverse. It's been quite warm in Europe to kick off the winter period and I think that most people particularly with respect to gas prices in Europe, spot prices have come off quite a bit or be it they are still very very volatile on a day to day basis. Storage has been filled up in Europe, clearly running above the usual levels of this time of year, but in some cases that has been because of the weakness we've seen.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1388,2022-11-21 03:19:28
18775," filled up in Europe, clearly running above the usual levels of this time of year. But in some cases, that has been because of the weakness we've seen in other areas, such as the weaker demand in China, as they face these ongoing lockdowns across the economy at points in time. So the key challenge, I think, is obviously how the weather evolves in Europe over the next few months, but also the demand side as they try to, or at least Europe tries to begin to rebuild inventories again going into summer next year. Now, when we look at capacity overall, capacity generally and particularly in crude oil and crude oil products, is still very constrained on a global basis. And we continue to see a lack of investment in that sector likely to constrain the supply side for years to come. Such that we actually have a recovery in crude oil prices going into next year to around $110 a barrel. When in your notes, you talk about this decade of transformation. It gives a sense of what you're talking about. You know, it's of course, perhaps moving to a more environmental ESG friendly world. How are you really recommending your clients invest in that sort of framework? Yeah, that's a really good question, Roosh. And I think it comes down to a couple of things. So at least in the short term, and if we just focus on energy is a great example of this, if we just focus on the short term, clearly that shift to cleaner fuels that have less emissions overall, which are not particularly disruptive to the overall status quo in things like power grids and so forth. So that shift to cleaner fuels is clearly a focus. However, if we look out five to ten years, we need to continue to focus on financing the, or sides of renewables, for example, such as solar, winds, as well as the upgrade of grids, etc. Now, within that, clearly the demand for commodities is going to be very much part of this. And one key thing, although we talked about energy before with respect to the lack of investment, what we've seen also over recent years of the lack of investment in new greenfield commodity capacity in mines such as copper mines, nickel and so forth. Now, these commodities are going to be very much in demand over the next five to ten years. And of course, the capacity is needed to catch up with that demand. So we can see that even though in the very short term, there's going to be more volatility in commodities, the demand side and the underinvestment will continue to hold commodities higher over the next five to ten years. All right, well, Wayne, let's talk about the Fed. We've heard Bostic favouring this slower Fed pace. What are you expecting? From our perspective, we expect another 50 basis points in December. For the Fed, we expect them to continue to hike in the first quarter of next year, most likely around the 25 basis point mark. And of course, we expect a pause thereafter. Hence the reason we have the sort of the peak in our dollar equation. While we think that the peaks in the dollar have probably already been seen, we expect the dollar to strengthen into the first quarter, which is key for many of the commodities out here in Asia, many of the currencies out here in Asia, as well as in other parts of the G10. So from our perspective, the Fed will continue to be very hawkish. They'll continue to talk about the elevation of inflation and how they need to see sequential lower inflation prints. And as a consequence, we think that the Fed are going to remain hawkish at the next meeting. Wayne, it was a pleasure. Thank you so much, Mr. Drenish Wayne Gordon there from UBS Global Wealth Management. Tis taking a... What's going on at the moment with the Federal Reserve and beyond?

Let's suppose you win a proxy fight and or you just get invited on to the board. You go to your first board meeting and you're the person who's saying you can fix this company and all of the others on the board of directors are saying well we're doing pretty well. How do you get received when you start saying here's what I wanted you to do? Well, first of all, we don't bring that to the board. Our time is spent with the CEO, the chairman, the CFO and share our plans with them outside the board. We try never to solve an issue in a board. Okay, it's always best done the day before the week before outside the afternoon. We wouldn't be there if they really were doing well. So it's really hard for them to straight face and tell us we're doing well. And we present them with a plan. We are just getting some breaking news that the chief of Malaysia's brissea national coalition. So remember this is the coalition that had won 13 out of the past 15 elections and is really going to hold the key as to whether or not opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim's Pakistan Harapan takes control of Malaysia's government or whether the pro is lamest PN party takes control. Well the chief of BN is now asking for flexibility on the King's 2 p.m. deadline for those parties to form an alliance. So we know that BN 130 of the 220 seats that were on offer during Saturday's election Anwar Ibrahim's opposition 182 and PN 173. So that 30 seats that they hold is really going to be the key as to whether or not they go with the pro is lamest PN party or whether or not they go with Anwar Ibrahim's more reformed party. So just reiterating that Malaysia's BN chief is requesting flexibility on the palace deadline. According to the constitution, though due to the constitution, I should say this deadline by the King is pretty set in stone. So it will be interesting to see whether or not there is any flexibility to the 2 p.m. deadline. And let's get a quick check now of course of the latest business flash headlines as well. And Disney says former CEO Bob Iger will return to the position effective immediately. The 71 year old spent more than four decades at Disney, including 15 years as its chief executive, a company statement says he's agreed to serve for two years succeeding Bob Chepek. Disney says that thanks Chepek for his service, but that Iger is uniquely, uniquely, excuse me, situated to lead the company through what it calls a pivotal period of industry transformation. Well Elon Musk has allowed Donald Trump's Twitter account to be restored after users on the social media website voted 52% to 48 to allow the former president's return. The last decision comes at a time of turmoil inside Twitter. A source has told Bloomberg that the billionaire is considering firing more employees.

We're seeing the composite index down by about 8.01%. Just generally we are seeing sliding stocks here. The stock here, COVID deaths and the fear of further restrictions on the COVID-19 policy, really dampening down any optimism. Certainly shares of companies tied to the reopening of the country if you will, on the way down after the Chinese first COVID-related deaths in almost six months. One spark in concerns about Beijing returning to those heightened restrictions of old. That is the position that we've got as we go into that. Lunch break, let's have a look at what's going on elsewhere. We move from one set of people going for lunch to another which returning. Having a look at the Nikkei 225, that is coming back in five seconds. The index of leading Tokyo or Japanese shares. They're mildly lower today. Again, it is that risk of sentiment which is affecting what's happening. We've got the Nikkei index unchanged more or less. Let's check in with that. There we go, we have there we go, the Nikkei just about unchanged now. As you can see, the stock market really driving things down. It's a hang saying. Let's move to these new court papers which show that some Bankman 3, the Bankrupt crypto empire owes its 50 biggest unsecured credit. It has more than $3 billion. The details come from Bloomberg's finance reporter, Shivashri Gosh. Shivashri.

18778," change now owes more than $3 billion to its top 50 unsecured creators. And out of that, about 10 of them are $100 million each. So that's a lot of money there. We are talking about, of course, along with that the new CEO of FTX, FDX, John Ray has said that they are conducting a global asset review of FTX. And according to him, some of the assets which are outside US could be solvent. And that could mean that some of this money could be used for paying these creditors, which is to some extent a good news there. So, Veshri, just tell us, I guess, what the crypto industry is facing in terms of the demand here and need for so much regulation considering what we've seen. Oh, yeah, that's a very important question, you know, because as we are seeing that the liquidation process is completely new in this kind of in this world of crypto, where we are seeing billions of dollars have been lent and without enough collateral and assets and recovery process. So, we are talking about a whole new set of regulation, a whole new set of regulatory rules that will come out, though we haven't yet seen any of that yet from any of the jurisdictions. But yes, regulators are in a hurry to talk about more, you know, what can be done to improve the consumer protection rules to kind of, you know, get these people to the books which who are, you know, lending without enough of the collateral. So, yes, a lot of regulatory gap there, but we should be, we hope that there will be something going ahead in terms of more regulation around crypto liquidation process and consumer protection.

China has been growing among U.S. and its allies about Beijing's security interests in the region.

A CEO succeeding Bob Chakert, Bloomberg, Sukhin and joins us from New York. This is effective immediately. Yes, and surprise could be an understatement. This appears to be a capitulation by the board to bring back Bob Iger. He was 15 years as CEO more than four decades at the company, but there have been a string of losing quarters at Disney. And this appears to be part of the motivation in bringing Iger back. Bob Chakert, who was announced to succeed Iger when he left two years ago, will be stepping down from that position. Again, this is a big change for the company. Iger 71 is back in the C-suite.

18780," period of industry transformation, Bob Igar is uniquely situated to lead the company through this pivotal period. Now, one of the key mandates that he will get is to reverse the steep decline in Disney shares, which are down with him 40 percent year to date. The company now headed toward their worst annual loss since at least the 1970s. The mandate is specifically from the board to quote, set the strategic direction for renewed growth and to work closely with the board in developing a successor to lead at the end of his two-year term. So he has accepted the invitation from the board to come back for two years. The board also thanked Bob Cheypack on his long career. He had been head of the park's division before taking over as Igar's successor. They wanted to thank him for his unprecedented efforts in dealing with the challenges of the pandemic, but they believe Igar is the CEO to lead them through what they call in increasingly complex period for the company and transformation. So is this a move going to be a market friendly? It would seem so. You know, Igar is associated with unprecedented growth for Disney. He also as his baby brought forward the Disney Plus streaming service, many of this streaming services facing challenges right now that maybe some of the reason that they've brought Igar back to guide that through this various, you know, period of macroeconomic headwinds went along in a pandemic where there's a captive audience at home streaming nonstop. And also, again, his relationship with the board, there are various reports that will be fleshed out no doubt in the next 24 hours of rising tensions on the board. And this is a view. It seems to go back to what had been a winning combination for Disney with Igar at the head. It's expected, this will be a boost for the shares. Back to you. Good stuff, Sue, Suki, in there. I'm going to now just tell you what 2018 minutes ago before a decision has been made on who's going to be the next Malaysian Prime Minister. Let's get to jewels in Kuala Lumpur. Yeah, absolutely. Would be Malaysian Prime Ministers really locked in this battle to secure enough vote to perform a government by that Monday afternoon deadline. This afternoon, on Saturday, of course, we saw the election result in the country's first ever hung parliament. Let's bring in Bridget Wells' honoree research associate at the University of Nottingham's Asia Research Institute Malaysia with me here in Kuala Lumpur. Great to see you, Bridget. I mean, it's been quite an extraordinary sort of a few days or a couple of days. I should say since that hung, since the election on Saturday with this hung parliament now, as we look ahead to the 2pm deadline, you sort of called this, though, that you thought it might come down to the wire. Well, I expected a hung parliament. I think the Perk and National, that one of the third coalitions, is slightly better than that was projected. But I think what we do see is the country that split. Democracy doesn't necessarily bring you what you expect. So, in terms of the alliances that would be happening here, as we try to see whether or not Ann White, Ibrahim's opposition party is going to get the BN30 votes or whether PN does, what do you think is going on behind closed doors? Well, we have basically two major kingmakers, the first of which is this coalition from Sarawak, GPS. They had 22 votes and seats. They have to reach total of 110, right? So they've really pledged allegiance to Perk and National. But that's not enough to get that particular coalition over. So we will see whether or not they will actually go to the second kingmaker, which is Verissa National, basically the party that was massively defeated in this election. And so what we see is the Verissa National leadership has basically seems to be leaning towards Paket and Hanwairován or Ibrahim. But at the same time, it's split. And so some individual members want to go with Perk and National. The laws prohibit individuals now from being able to make those types of defection. So we're in a lock situation. A lot of people we've been speaking to saying if BN does go with PN, then you're essentially going to get the government that we've just had just with a different leader. What would a Malaysian government under Ann White, Ibrahim, look like? Actually, first of all, I disagree with the fact that if we get a PN plus BN government, it's actually going to be very...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1394,2022-11-21 03:45:27
18781," What would a Malaysian government under Anwa Ibrahim look like? Actually, first of all, I disagree with the fact that if we get a PN plus PN government, it's actually going to be very different. Because we have a much larger Islamist contingent, we have almost 40 Ustas now that are going into the parliament, and they have a very more dominant role. So it's a much more ultra-Malay Islamist type of government if it is a PN government. It's not the same government before. And keep in mind that previous government had no non-Malay representation, and the election results show that no non-Malay's voted for the National in terms of the statistically meaningfully so. So we're actually seeing a very ethnically divided situation if that happens. In terms of a Pakistan-Harafan, it would have potentially a bar as a national contingent, and potentially some would need some support from East Malaysia, either Borneo or Saurawak. It may not necessarily get it from GPS because GPS is pledged to PN at this point, but it's looking to what's happening in Saba, which is a much more fragmented political process. This is a lot of acronyms for our global audience, but when we are looking at in terms of what a new Malaysian government is going to look like really moving away from 2018, we were hoping to move away from that identity politics, I guess, and political stability, political integrity. Do you think that that is actually what we're seeing? So what's happened in Malaysia is that it's been the rise of more conservative right forces in the context of a post-COVID environment, the crisis. The conservative forces are trying to consolidate. What we see is a more progressive forces are trying to bring in more of the middle ground to try to win support, but the middle ground is very divided. Do I see the situation being able to resolve itself quickly? I think the king is basically trying to pressure the coalitions to have the Malaysian have a government early because this is the first time that countries ever had a hung parliament. Do we ever see a Malaysia where party lines are not so drawn by race? I think that what we have seen is ethnic voting and racialized voting increase this particular election, particularly because the Ultramalay Islamist coalition used a lot of hate speech. Now, all parties used hate speech, but in particular, some of the dialogue and discourse in this particular campaign was very emotive and very volatile. And I think that's why there's a lot of raw emotions about what would potentially be the new government because they don't necessarily seem to have any more inclusion of minorities, which make up almost 40% of Malaysia's population. And what did you see as the youth vote being potentially a game changer here after they lowered the voting age from 21 to 18, meaning there were nearly six million more people heading to the polls? So one of the things that PM, the Islamist coalition I'm speaking to you about, did is that they actually controlled a lot of money, they controlled social media, and they controlled a lot of advertising. And so this was very impactful on younger voters. Younger voters split between PN and Pakistan Harapun. And we see as a consequence that PN particularly picked up Malay, the largest communities younger voters in large numbers. All right, well, we will wait just over two hours now until that deadline from the King Richard Welsh from the University of Nottingham Asia Research Institute Malaysia with me live here in Kuala Lumpur, Rish.

18782," music Welcome to the world of decentralized finance. I'm going to take a look right here at regulation. We are seeing digital currencies under some pressure. Bloomberg's covering all things crypto. The people. I want to have some of my money outside of the solder. The transactions. It all comes down to the details here. And the technology. How does that affect disruptors like you? What happens to everything that you're investing is when the last Bitcoin is mined? Bloomberg crypto Tuesdays. You will shed light on dark matter. You will make aging optional. Because when you subscribe to Bloomberg, you won't just get news. You'll get insight into limitless possibilities. Before you change the world, Bloomberg. All right, well, it is time for India focus. We're going to turn our attention to the transition to renewable energies. India's Sanitika recently secured a $400 million investor from KKI. It's one of the country's largest injections of funds into decarbonization. Pratik Agrawal is director for Serentic Renewables and joins us exclusively as Pratik, thank you so much. You're joining us. First of all, what do you do exactly? Thank you very much for having me this morning on my channel. So, sir, just to give you a quick background, in light of 27 and the rates to keeping 1.5 degrees alive, this is a very, very exciting deal that you've done with KKI. But Serentica does is that it focuses on energy intensive heart-robate industries, which need to decarbonize their supply chain. And it does this by providing down on the clock green energy at a low cost to such heart-robate industries. As you know, about 30% of all greenhouse gas emissions come from industrial emissions. And very little has happened in the last 10, 15 years in terms of reducing the emissions of such industries. We're very, very excited with this deal using this capital. We will focus on first executing, off first, 1,500 megawatts of round-the-clock wind solar hydro energy. We will extreme time in the next two years and deliver three billion units of green power to some very energy intensive industries in India. You will also use this topic to grow out. Yes, go ahead. Pratik, I want to give a sense of, you know, offering around the clock solutions here as well, to industries. How will you essentially store it as well? I mean, are you going to have your own storage projects or are you going to be going to other companies which offer these kind of energy storage solutions? So you can do round-the-clock in multiple ways. It's a very important question because the intermittency is the biggest challenge here. One way of being out of the clock is by oversizing a lot of your wind and solar capacity so that you can deliver very close to round-the-clock, perhaps 80 to 90 percent of the time you're delivering green power. And then to take it all the way to 90 or 100 percent, you of course have to have storage. Recently we signed 8, 1500 megawatt or the largest storage company in India, which just comes hydro storage and we've contracted that out to them. So our plan is to do wind and solar and other sources of energy by ourselves. And then for the moment, we will do the storage with our storage partner. Pratik, do you think that India is actually on track to meet its renewable target goals by 2030? To make a step by and understand policy framework under which India is operating. India has a goal of 500 kilowatt so renewable by 2030. It's currently at about 160 kilowatt. In my view, India has some of the most attractive policy frameworks make green energy happen and that has been showed in the more than 30 billion dollars of investment standard received just in the last three or in the renewable energy sector. I think there are three challenges facing India. One is the availability of a large transmission grid.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1396,2022-11-21 03:54:07
18783," just in the last three years in the renewable energy sector. I think there are three challenges facing India. One is the availability of a large transmission grid. It needs to spend much more on its grid to keep up with the renewable growth that is there. The second one is land. While we have a surplus of enough land, but the systems and processes it takes to acquire that land needs to get a bit faster. And the third of what have you mentioned is intimacy. How can we invest a lot faster and a lot more in all storage technologies that are really as well as non-mattery? Is there any sort of conflict of interest or business in conflict your business with KKR's renewable business? Not at all, actually. KKR has an existing investment in India and around the world in operating assets. We are now in another platform which will be developing renewable assets almost solely catering to the industrial decarbonisation which is different from their existing investments. And we already have a very strong relationship with KKR. This is our second deal with them. The first one was a transmission in India grid about four years ago, which were very successful for both parties. So we're very, very happy to work with KKR and we're very happy to find the like-minded investor which is very interested in seeing sustainable development solutions around the world. Tamiya Prasadik, now, okay, what are your list of priorities? Which ways are you going to get your investments to bear fruit here? And what's your timeline? So our first initial goal is to execute 1512 awards of winds for the hybrid power across four states of India and you want to commission this in the next few years. With this, we will deliver three billion units of green power to industries which are currently consuming a lot of thermal energy. So we feel very excited of make a very, very important dent in their next year's emissions. We will also start expanding our portfolio beyond our current EPAs and signing power supply agreements with other hardware sectors like steel, cement, data sectors, etc. And we will thirdly invest in our capability of forming our power. So you talk a lot storage, but there are many other ways of providing some power as well, such as using the brake, such as with interesting types of storage, different types and locations of your renewable generation can provide you with providing around the power. So our goal is to focus on those three, immediately execute our existing projects of why I'm more contracts as well as grow our capability around the power. I take pleasure having on the program. Thank you so much for joining this project. I'll go a while there from my so-and-tiket renewables. Quick look at what's going on here in Hong Kong as we get off that lunch break in just about five minutes and thereabouts. And it is an index which quite often just leads things up. It also leads things down. That's what we're doing. We're down as much as 3.7 percent of the moment, thanks Hang saying here, down 2.2 percent in essence. It's all down to fears about China tightening its COVID curbs. We've got, of course, the countries see its first COVID deaths in almost six months on Saturday. We've also, at the moment, seen this outlook for monetary policy from the Federal Reserve play a role in dampening down the optimism, if you will. We get the Fed minutes later this week. A lot more on the way, including next, Bloomberg Daybreak Middle East.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1397,2022-11-21 03:58:38
18784," So now you've been a JP Morgan for about 25 years? Yes. Okay, so and now you run one of the most important parts of JP Morgan, which is I say is the asset and wealth management business. That actually is wealth management and how is that different than asset management? Great question. The two are often used interchangeably, but they have distinctions. Asset management business is where we manage money on behalf of individuals, institutions, sovereign wealth funds, pension funds. We manage them in mutual funds, we manage them in ETFs, we manage them in single stock, single bonds, hedge funds, private equity. And the like and that is the heart of the fiduciary business that we run here at JP Morgan. wealth management is that plus understanding someone's entire balance sheet. So for the individuals where we manage money, we also help them with their mortgage. We help them with alone that they might need. We help them with their basic credit card. And so wealth management is trying to help someone with their entire life, both their assets and their liabilities, their planning, their gifting, the legacy that they want to leave for their families, the 529 plans they need to prepare to get their kids to go through college. And it's a great insight into people's, you know, entire journey. While Tesla's in the like, make for good headlines, the reality is that even if every car on the road today won electric, it wouldn't be enough to curb global emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions from transportation account for about 29% of total US greenhouse gas emissions. So what about the other 71%? Building to crowds America burned fossil fuels to operate. What we want to do is make that all electric. Instead of burning oil and gas to give us the energy and electricity we need, we want to do 100% clean energy, all electric. We want to turn buildings into Tesla's, just like a Tesla or an electric vehicle is all electric with no fossil fuels. We want to do that with our buildings. If we can do it in one building, we can do it in all buildings. And if we do it in all buildings, we'll reduce 30% of US greenhouse gas emissions. A multi trillion dollar industry, there's a lot of ground to cover. Bloomberg ETF IQ Monday on Bloomberg. When US jobs numbers are released, Bloomberg brings you crucial data at terminal speed and instant expert analysis. Nobody covers jobs day like Bloomberg. This is what we take very quickly. Saratop stories this morning, China reports its first cover fatalities in almost six months as cases spike while another city is rumored to be the test case for the reopening. Well, that's seeing lockdowns return, stocks in Hong Kong and the mainland are tumbling on the news. We've all thought out from the collapse of FTX continues. New court papers show that the bankrupt crypto conglomerate owes more than $3 billion to its top 50 unsecured creditors. Nego Shaders in Egypt strike a deal on climate justice, but the final compromise leaves big doubt over the prospect for new efforts to curb emissions. And the football world cup finally kicks off and Qatar with the lavish opening ceremony after a build up marred by controversy. We're going to be live in Doha over the next few hours. Now it is 8 AM across the Emirates. I'm used to Gameledin in Dubai. There is this cloud around lockdowns across China that is weighing on sentiment.

18785," across China that is weighing on sentiment. I want to give you the rundown this Monday morning. This is the state of play on the S&P 500. Many we are called a little bit higher here by about half of 1%. This is a bit of a reflection of both some of the dynamics involved. In fact, this is the last close to be clear. Futures at the moment called lower by a fifth of 1%. US 10 to Yale 379 15. The dollar index stood out to me here. The Bloomberg dollar index a little bit of strength. But what is the takeaway is that fund managers are piling on dollar short bets. The most since July 2021 according to the latest CFTC data on eight currency pairs compiled by Bloomberg. The Brent crew down 1% Goldman Sachs out with a new note. They lowered their fourth quarter 2022 Brent forecast by $10 a barrel. So now they're looking at $100 a barrel on concerns over weakness coming through from China. This chart, TV go for our clients, some of the other important highlights. This is BlackRock riding about a rotation into credit funds with investors making a return. So fourth quarter inflows into credit funds have been surging. You've got the cooling inflation data and that signals a slower fed interest rate increase. And so yields at both the high grade and the junk end of the credit are now signing the look a little bit appealing. Let's get to iron ore on the commodity side we talked about the energy side of the equation. Now the metals component where we're seeing intraday large moves on the Singapore contract sinking after three weeks of gains with some of the COVID uncertainty in China. The steel making ingredient to intraday down about 1.4%. We were as low as 4% pairing a three week surge towards $100 a ton. The anti virus measures have really clouded some of the visibility on this integral metal for the wider markets this year. Let's check it on what else is happening in Asia. Anvil Drulu joins us from Hong Kong. Bell. Thanks, you said. Yeah, certainly any part of reopening in China from COVID zero is going to be failing messy. So that is certainly a dominant trading theme. Otherwise in Asia, we're also focused on just how serious fed officials are about to this possible pivot as well in rate hikes for the size and the magnitude moving forward in the months ahead. Even though we're seeing options traders in the treasury market, at least piling a debits that will pay off with a pivot today, though we do seem to be a little bit more focused on what we've also heard from the likes of the Boston Fed president, Susan Miller, saying that or Susan Collins saying that we are perhaps going to see a 75 basis point hike in December. She is not ruling that out. So this is the state of play as we head into the trading session today. We're also keeping an eye on stocks in Malaysia, given that the vote at the weekend produced the first ever hung parliament and lawmakers have until 2pm. So just on their couple hours away to name who will be the next leader. In terms of what else are watching today, if you just change it on, I said, yes, we are very much focused on what is happening in China. We are seeing stocks really tumbling here, even though we had seen Wall Street banks ramping up their bets once again on the outlook for the country. But certainly, as I said, it really is a difficult path out of some of the harshest COVID-19 policies globally, you said. Thanks. That's Anna Valdroulos there. We'll check back in with you later on the program. I want to get to the China story with a bit more depth because the country reported its first COVID fatalities since May is cases spike nationwide. Hightening concerns at cities including the capital could see a return to tougher restrictions. Great to see you, Secretary John Newt, John's just now live from Beijing. John, can you give our global audience a bit of a sense of what's it like on the ground and what they need to look out for? Sure. The infection numbers have spiked pretty notably in the last couple of days here in Beijing. We've had almost 1,000 cases reported for Sunday. We also had two deaths reported on Sunday and on Saturday, we had the first death reported in about half a year in China. Elsewhere around the country in Guangzhou, they had more than 8,000 cases reported on Sunday. That's part of local officials to lock down a district in that city. In the city of Shuja Drog near Beijing, they had about 650 cases reported on Sunday and that has resulted in the city asking every...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1399,2022-11-21 04:07:08
18786," down a district in that city. In the city of Shuja Drog near Beijing, they had about 650 cases reported on Sunday and that has resulted in the city asking everyone to stay at home and then also starting to mass test in several of its central districts. That in turn has raised concerns that as infection numbers increase, we will see more of the old strategies, the lockdowns, the mass testing return and that opening that started a couple of weeks ago will potentially the worries slow. The one year loan primerate has been kept steady at 3.65 percent according to a statement by the PBOC. I'm kind of getting the sense that this is caution and it is maybe a little bit too much caution in the face of economic turmoil. In terms of the economy, I think what we are really looking forward to is the economic work conference that happens every December. At that meeting, top policymakers will get together and they'll plan out what they want to do in 2023. We don't have a time for that meeting yet, but ahead of that meeting, I think any steps that we will see from Beijing will be caution, not taking too much risk, keeping things going as best they can. And obviously it's very hard to tell which way the COVID situation is going to turn next as well. John, this has been hugely helpful. Thank you for the analysis. That's our great China senior executive editor, John Liu in Beijing. Now let's get to football because the 2022 World Cup has kicked off in Qatar. The lavish show opening ceremony in a match between the hosts and Ecuador. It's a combination of a 12 year build-up that's been marred by controversy over human rights and the environmental impact. Bloomberg says the one Foxman was watching from the stands. So I watched the match in 4K in the luxury of my home living room area there, but what was it like in the stadium? Well, I think here the important bit is that Qatar passed its first test of its hosting ability. Logistically, things went pretty okay. There was a bunch of traffic getting there, and then this concession stands ran out of food, but those are pretty minor issues. And overall the opening ceremony was fantastic. The play on the pitch less so Qatar clearly outmatched by Ecuador from early on in the game, Ecuador scoring twice in the very first half. But as with so many things about this World Cup, the focus really what happening off the pitch. We saw major world leaders, regional leaders here in Qatar, President Erdogan, President Abdel Fattah, as CC of Egypt, shaking hands in a picture that was publicized with Sheikh Tamiyem, the emerald Qatar, in the middle of those two apparently meeting for the very first time. Also important, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, he was here, he actually canceled a trip to Japan, maybe to be here. And he was seated next to Gianni Infantino, the President of FIFA. This has reports swirl that Saudi Arabia, along with Egypt and Greece, they want to hold the 2030 World Cup. Interesting. I would have loved to have been in had an ear in that conversation, right, Isif? Absolutely, and we've got some strong matches later today, in Netherlands, in Senegal, should be one to tune in for Simone. Thank you for the moment that Simone Foxman, at the Qatar Financial Center in Doha. Now, a new court paper show that Sam Bankman freeds Bankrupt crypto empire owes its 50 biggest, unsecured, creditors more than $3 billion. We've got the details now with our finance reporter, Svash Rikosh. So, Svash Rikh, I mean, this is a redacted document. What were we able to glean from the few highlights? Sure, hi, thank you. So, basically, what the Bankruptcy Court filing show, as you mentioned, is that in the FTXS, stock 50 creditors are owed more than $3 billion and out of that, 10 of them are owed about $100 million each and two more than $200 million. So, that's a lot of money that we're talking about over here. Alongside, we also have heard from the new FTX CEO, John Ray, saying that they are going, they are taking...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1400,2022-11-21 04:11:26
18787," Alongside, we also have heard from the new FTX CEO, John Ray, saying that they are taking a review of the entire global asset balance sheet of FTX. And he has also said that, you know, a part of the assets outside FTX US shows that there is some solvency, some kind of elements of solvency in those assets, which means a part of that can be used to repay maybe the creditors in the bankruptcy filings. Sovashi, thanks for the update. That's Bloomberg's finance report of Sovashi Gosh on the FTX development. Well, let's check in on the first world headlines for you from around the world. Here's what we're looking at. Climate negotiators in Egypt have struck a deal that resets the relationship between the rich and poor countries. Approved without a single opposing voice, the agreement creates a fund that helps developing nations face the devastation of climate change, although the deal is a historic victory negotiators failed to secure commitments for more ambitious cuts on greenhouse gas emissions. US and China have resumed formal talks on climate change. China's climate envoy says the two countries agreed to discuss how to address the losses and damages developing nations are experiencing as a consequence of climate change. But he also says any new deal should mirror the Paris agreement. UN's atomic agency says powerful blasts, Tethan, shake off shaken the area around the Ukraine separation nuclear power plant. This includes more than a dozen on Sunday morning. The IEA, or rather the IAA, says some buildings and systems were damaged, but none critically. Crane's nuclear regulator says Russian forces struck the facility. But Russia's army issued a statement blaming Ukraine for the shunning. Turkey has carried out air strikes against US-backed Kurdish militant groups in Iraq and Northern Syria. Defense ministry says the raids were to eliminate what it called a terrorist threat and came after a deadly bombing that targeted civilians in Istanbul. The offensive could shore up flagging domestic support for Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan ahead of elections next year. Global news 24 hours a day and on Bloomberg Quicktake, power by more than 2700 journalists in more than 120 countries. Let's get you a snapshot of what else is still to come. Ever attend these Edward Bell gives us his insights on the market impact of the World Cup as the focus turns to the football fields of Doha. But up next we'll talk. Markets rise with Alliance Bird Steens, Brad Gibson, this Bloomberg. What do you think of when you think of a battery? The most is what we use to power devices for both work and play and maybe even your car. Over the past few decades they've gotten way more powerful, long-lasting and affordable. But all of this is just a prologue to what the next batteries are going to do. As we drive to an increasingly renewable power driven grid, we also need to be able to store energy and release it later to cover those periods of weather intermittencies that are driving this new grid that we're in. It's a multi-trillion dollar opportunity and it's imperative that we figure out the solution here. How we store energy on a massive scale is in many ways the central challenge of the fight to stop climate change. I think that it's hard to put your head around any narrative. We just be honest.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1401,2022-11-21 04:15:44
18788," I think that it's hard to put your head around any narrative. Let's just be honest. We've had sort of a shift in, are we in some sort of cypheration fears? We're talking about that all day yesterday. We in the United States probably need to be careful about our evangelizing influence. I don't think it's really for us to tell China how they should organize their entire society. The former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers warning US policymakers to focus on building the country's own strength rather than attacking China. I have bullish consensus for Chinese shares has emerged on Wall Street, but the country's first COVID fatalities in months and title restrictions and some districts are denting optimism considerably on the Hang Seng. We are down about 2.1 percent similar losses in the Chinese mainland as well. From there I take you to some of the other market moves to kind of get you plugged in with where the S&P 500 mini is at. We had the close at the beginning of the show. This is the actual futures contract down about a quarter of 1 percent. You know, standing yields of 378 and the Bloomberg dollar index a little bit stronger. We had the fund manager survey that showed that a lot of investors are piling into some of the dollar shorts on a bet that we're going to reach peak Fed hikes, most since July 2021 and then Brent Crude down 1 percent. Let's get to another important voice and that is the IMF managing director, Kristalina Girogeva, because she says the trade barriers against China and other countries could cost the global economy 1.4 trillion dollars. Speaking to us at the APEC summit, Girogeva said that nations need to avoid divisions as they face the fallout of multiple crises. In a difficult time for the world economy, this part performs better, but to sustain growth would require overcoming fragmentation that is a big threat to the world today. Theresa meets one message. We must work together because we are in a world that is going from one shock to another. pandemic inflation, more inflation, cost of living crisis. If we add on top of it the fragmentation in the world economy, it would be throwing gasoline on a fire. Nobody benefits from it. How concerned are you though the prolonged isolation of China's economy might even be more prolonged and there will be potentially, we have seen it in the property sector, we have seen defaults, we have seen job losses. These headwinds insurmountable if this goes on too long. They are significant and what I am hoping to see is some reversal in policies about towards China and globally. The world is going to lose 1.5% of GDP just because of divisions that may split us into two trading blocks. This is 1.4 trillion dollars. Just imagine what we can do with these kinds of money. For Asia, the loss is much more significant because Asia is so integrated in global value chains. It could be 3% or more. Let's talk about inflation. At Bloomberg, New Economy Forum, Singapore, there have been false bonds on inflation possibly easing before. Are there particular economies in the world worried they might reverse tackling inflation too soon?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1402,2022-11-21 04:19:59
18789," and possibly easing before. Are there particular economies in the world where you worried that they might reverse tackling inflation too soon? I'm not worried about United States. Let me start from that, because US economy is the most important in that regard. The Fed is going to state the course for as long as it takes to bring inflation down to Target. In Europe, the situation is more difficult. Why? Because there, the impact of the war in Ukraine is significant. Half of the European Union, at least, would be in recession next year. That would put pressure on the European Central Bank to ease conditions. I was relieved to hear my predecessor, Cristina Lagarde, saying we are not going to do that. But the politicians in Europe may be more vocal in trying to get relief before it is time to do so. You have to go, but is there anything else you wanted to say? Well, you have us on camera right now. Have you on camera? The very best message I have heard in this three summits was a president's jokowi. This war must end. The single most damaging factor for the world economy is the war. And if we want to return to growth, the sooner the war ends, the better. The IMF manager, director Cristina Georgieva, speaking to Bloomberg Stephen Engel. So much for the come. This is Bloomberg. I've always been a person who has just been attracted to hair. I like to sit and think and theorize how I can manifest these visions that I have for braiding and how I can take something that may seem like it's a line drawing in my mind and apply that to someone's scalp. We are the only culture that has hair that grows out of our head the way that it does. Anyone from the African diaspora is born with this amazingly curly hair that can be shaped into a variety of different ways of expression. I want black people to love themselves for how they naturally appear and also to appreciate the cultural practice as such as braiding that our ancestors have practiced for centuries.

The company statement says he's agreed to serve two years succeeding Bob Chappell. Disney says it thanks Chappell for his service, but that Iger is uniquely situated to lead the company through what it calls a pivotal period of industry transformation.

18790," Elon Musk has allowed Donald Trump's Twitter account to be restored. After users on the social media website voted 52% to 48% to allow the former president to return, Musk's decision comes at a time of turmoil inside Twitter as sources tell Bloomberg that the billionaire is considering firing more employees this time. The layoffs could target the sales and partnership side of the business. The financial times is reporting that Chinese authorities are helping Foxconn re-staff its iPhone assembly lines. The Hannaan government reportedly ordered officials to recruit new workers for the iPhone maker while Foxconn raised wages and offered bonuses. Foxconn suffered a worker exodus late last month in a COVID-19 outbreak. At least a dozen employees have accused the EV maker Rivian of safety violations at its Illinois plant. The complaints filed with the federal regulators say the company ignored known hazards and enlist the range of injuries. The statement the company disputes the allegations saying creating a safe environment as part of its operating procedures. Spokesman has declined to comment on the specific complaints. And that is your Bloomberg business flash. Let's get to another interview. This is the Papua New Guinea Prime Minister who says that the Chinese president Xi Jinping has never expressed interest in a military base in his nation. Beijing has been looking to beef up its security interests in the Pacific, alarming the U.S. and its regional allies. James Marrake, they have spoke exclusively with Bloomberg's Stephen Enger. Let me be open and China for once has never, never expressed clearly their interest for military base or presence of the sort of nature in PNG. And they've heared me clearly also. Yesterday's conversation with President Xi Jinping for instance. All conversations in the good 20 minutes we spoke just on what they could do for business for us. Nothing about the military. Nothing about military. Nothing about aid and grant. You know made reference to past support. But under my watch I'm saying aid and grant is okay. But I am more about you buying my produces. You bring a investor's in. So China state cleared cleared of those conversations. Are you concerned though by the politicization of this region and that the competing superpowers are perhaps seeing you as in between competing visions for this part of the world? I'm concerned and the past week is concerned but I think finding that mutual round for respect upon each other is important and I was happy at G20 that the global big leaders met and they talked. It's a first step in the right direction talking and understanding. We may not change either. It's at as well we overnight but there's a place for tolerance and there's a place for securing a better future for the entire children of our planet. If not now for a future going forwards. What is the risk of possible militarization of this part of the world? I don't think there will be any other nations coming into the Pacific for instance for military presence. It is up to our leaders in the region to call for military presence if need be but our specific bilateral with international health guide and PNG the context has no desire and that matter has China proposed for instance. They have not. To have a military base in PNG. Is there any dialogue on a security pact with China? Not at the States. No conversation. That was the Papua New Guinea Prime Minister James Marappé. I want to get back to this part of the world and specifically equities where on the Sunday most of the region trades with the exception of Dubai and Abu Dhabi. Here were some of the highlights barely above the flatline for the EGX. A little bit of downside on the Dow 8.1% of the losing streak continues with energy prices under pressure and a recession beginning to look like in mainstream scenario and that is feeding on the other trade which is Brent and I want to run you through that because that is where a lot of the pain is being felt and we had a note out from Goldman Sacks they cut their 20 22 fourth quarter Brent forecast by $10 a barrel to $100 a barrel of Bitcoin.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1404,2022-11-21 04:28:53

Next month, the logic of exponential virus spread means further lockdowns will be required if full reopening is not feasible. The writing goes on to argue, and today we're down 1%.

18792," much they will be able to relax their policies, the likes of the 8 shares index trimming it's a monthly advance now up around 20% and reopening shares really taking a hit. So that is a state of play we're half now out from the open there into the afternoon session but let's change on now because that certainly is driving the direction around much of Asian trading this Monday. You can see here we're really a sea of redder for the equity's picture across the board today. Other sectors also moving to the downside including Singapore and India in terms of what else are watching seeing a bit of a move higher for bond yields particularly at the long duration of the curve. That is also as investors really weigh up the recession risks. How serious the Fed is about continuing to to hike rates as we have the likes of the Boston Fed president Susan Collins saying that perhaps she could see a 75 basis point move in December even though the Atlanta Fed president for instance Rafael Bostic is saying he's open to a more moderate pace of rate hikes ahead and then also just keeping an eye on what's happening in the currency space given the Malaysian ring at one of the biggest declines today after the results of that Malaysian election you said. Well thank you for that that's an animal droulers live from Hong Kong. I want to get to the Malaysian political leaders because they have about two hours before they're due to inform the king of their choice of prime minister after Saturday's election failed to produce a clear winner. Julie it's not only joins us now live from Kuala Lumpur. So Jules are quite a eventful 48 hours to say the least as we get into this Monday but bring us up to speed of where we're at. Yeah absolutely use of Malaysia's first ever hung parliament. Less than 90 minutes now until the parties have to try and form that alliance and inform the king by his 2 p.m deadline and it really could come down to the long running Burisian national coalition which has pretty much been in power for most of the 57 years of independence and now finds itself in the kingmaker position after its key umno party actually did not get many seats at Saturday's election so is it going to tie in with opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim's Pakistan Harapang party this is the more reformist party and help him form government and realise his dream of becoming a prime minister of Malaysia or will they go with the former Premier Mighir and Yassin and the pro Islamist PN party and help form a coalition there so both parties really need 111 seats to form a government here you can imagine there would be a lot of deal making going on in the 90 minutes before the king is informed and we heard the bn chief earlier asked for a bit more flexibility in that deadline unclear as to whether or not the king is going to grant that one more thing to note in this very interesting election Yusuf is that 97 year old Mahatir Muhammad who was a Malaysia's longest seven prime minister lost his seat in Saturday's election. Jules you've been on the ground for a few days now over there and you've had the important conversations what is the dominant concern for voters could you just put that together for context? Yeah well I mean and this really comes down to what Bloomberg uses about two Yusuf it's about the economy I mean my producer and I spend a fair bit of time on the weekend at wet markets at hawker centres is about people trying to put food on the table you have a minimum average salary of 1500 ring at per month that is about $329 US dollars and it is about three times less than Malaysia's own central bank said was the basic cost of living back in 2018 so you can imagine when people can't afford to put food on the table this is what drove them to the polls this is about what they want economic stability and they also want political integrity remember four years ago that shocked defeat of being was caused by the one mdb scandal with the former prime minister Najib Razak in jail now too and of course it's all about foreign inflows and foreign attracting foreign investment too because you've got a Malaytas key benchmarked down by about 24 percent from its record high in April 2018 Yusuf. Jules fantastic reporting will be of course crossing out to you throughout the morning that's Jules Yatselin live in Singapore. Let's get to the 22-22 world cup again because it's kicked off in Qatar with a very glamorous opening ceremony on the match between the hosts and Ecuador for the locals this match was definitely underwhelming because they lost to zero. Lubric Simone Foxman was watching it from the stand. Could you just run us through what it was like getting to the",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1406,2022-11-21 04:37:29
18793," which was definitely underwhelming because they lost two zero. The work Simone Foxman was watching it from the stand. Could you just run us through what it was like getting to the stadium and then, you know, watching the opening ceremony, were there any glitches? You know, minimal glitches, Yusuf. I was driving there because this is one of the few stadiums that's not connected to the metro system. And certainly there was a bunch of traffic. There wasn't some great food options, but look, those are pretty minimal. In comparison to the impressive opening display, and I think the atmosphere for most of the game, you know, until maybe late in the second half was pretty good with a lot of fans in attendance. But the real test, I think, coming up is I went to a bunch of fan zones and fan areas yesterday. And they were pretty empty, I have to say. And, you know, Qatar has worked so hard at trying to limit the number of people that are going to be here at any given time. So it doesn't place a lot of stress on infrastructure, so they have enough accommodation to kind of handle everyone. But I was surprised at just how empty things were. That said, remember the first opening match was rescheduled back after a lot of people had already made their travel plans back in August. So maybe it's that tourists just haven't shown up yet. Also, a lot to watch out for today. Very contentious Iran, England match for various reasons, political reasons, protests going on in Iran. But also because we heard a decision from FIFA that Harry Kane would not be allowed to wear his one love arm band in support of LGBTQ rights. I'm clear if we'll actually go through with that, because he faces bands and booking, if not. And that's kind of one of those key issues that's really been a flash quite for this tournament in general. This has been 12 years of the making. So sponsors by and large have taken a position on this event. You know, they could have been in and they could have been out. How are they responding to a lot of the public criticism that has been accelerated over the weekend, because it's been around for some time. But it obviously all went up a notch if anybody's been following both the press conference of the FIFA president and some of the writing and some of the newspapers and the responses. Well, certainly what Alex Web and I found out is that sponsors are very paying a lot of close attention to what's happening in Qatar. But I went out, I surveyed 76 sponsors of national teams in Europe, the US, and Canada. And I also asked FIFA sponsors based in those same countries where criticism around human rights has been widespread. This less a test of those human rights issues, more a test of how companies were responding to this. And what I found was very few changed their global advertising plans in order to cope with these human rights concerns. In fact, of those 13 that did, just three had any even tenuous business ties to the state of Qatar. So for all we get this ESG and social impact rhetoric from companies, global companies, the likes of Adidas, Coca-Cola, McDonald's, many willing to offer statements in support of human rights, but very few willing to actually change their marketing plans, put their ad dollars where their mouth is. And part of this is because there are five billion, as many as five billion people around the world that are going to watch this event. Simone, thanks for that. I am a little bit envious that you get to do all these fun things. That is Simone Foxman at the kind of financial center in Doha. Let's get some additional perspective on the market impact of the World Cup. Joining us now is Ed Bell. He's the senior director of Market Economics at Emirates, NBD. Ed, do you have a favor for the World Cup? I got to go for Canada. We're in it for the first time in decades. So I know it's a long shot, but I got to support that sort of home side. All right, so you're going with an underdog. In terms of the market, and it's been a long-running discussion, of course, in the region about, you know, how much of a domino effect there is from the event in Doha. What is your top line way to quantify?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1407,2022-11-21 04:41:51
18794," You know, how much of a domino effect there is from the event in Doha? What is your top line way to quantify the multiplier effect of an event like that? And whether it really lives up to a lot of the hype? Yeah, well I think what this is going to do is bring attention to the region for good enforcer or some scrutiny that obviously you've seen quite a lot of that in the past couple of weeks. But also for a place like the UAE which has very well established world class infrastructure that has the ability to offer essentially shuttle flights back to and from Doha every single day. It's going to be another sort of kind of feather in the cap I think for the UAE in terms of promoting it as a viable and very sustainable tourist site for a lot of visitors coming in from other countries that are participating in the World Cup or who just football fans. So that's the sort of net positive impact that we're watching out for from the kind of hospitality and tourism side. Beyond that I think you know there are the benefits that Tat or can take away from this in terms of the infrastructure development that's gone on that's going to be a long lasting impact for the economy there. It's quite enormous given the scale of Qatar's economy but still probably going to be a querying benefit for some time. I mean according to some of the calculations that have been done including some of the Bloomberg data it suggests shutting out of $300 billion for this event which eclipses any previous spending on a world cup. The issue is what happens after and the overhang from creating so much additional infrastructure maybe even more so than it was the case in Brazil and South Africa because Qatar is so small. Is that a source of nervousness for you even perhaps in Dubai where there's been a lot of expansion? I don't think it's necessary a source of nervousness and it's important to remember that this is a region that's not really short on capital right. So these projects while they have what looks like a big nominal price tag attached to them they can be afforded and they can be financed in the region probably pretty handedly. So the ability of Qatar to be able to sustain this from a financing point of view over long term is not necessarily a negative. In terms of the kind of scale of infrastructure that's being brought in perhaps we get a little bit more sort of duplication or additional resources coming into the region you know expanded airports more tourism and hospitality infrastructure that might help to bring costs down which can also be a little bit of a positive I think to any visitor coming into the region if they have more options available and helped open a bit more of a competitive hospitality market. I want to talk about what is giving a lot of these Gulf countries the power to finance the projects and that was a resilient Brent crude price or WTI price basically crude oil prices. We're seeing once again Brent crude under pressure this morning the worry around a more protracted recession and especially weakness out of China as we count down to the Russian oil price cap which is meant to take effect next week what are you telling clients about the trajectory for energy price. Well when we look at that the oil price cap that comes into play at the start of December is an enormous unknown probably with the risks skewed towards the upside. So when we look at the balance of risks for 2023 in oil markets we still think that there is upside risk even at the conditions that we're going to be going into what could be a slower economy in most major economies. So if we have a protracted slowdown in parts of the Eurozone in China in the United States yes that is negative for oil consumption but it's probably not going to be necessarily one that's a total uncertainty in terms of how deep and how long that recession is going to be central banks governments have the ability to step in and help sort of put a floor under economic activity but there isn't the same kind of buffers available in the oil market in terms of supply. Okay. We have this big uncertainty about the Russian oil supply but also very few inventories that are available to help support things. That's really interesting so you disagree then with the Goldman Sachs call that they cut their oil price forecast by $10 a barrel for the fourth quarter 2022 you would suggest that markets are tight. I think right now the dominant narrative is around recession and that's creating the fears around the oil price. And perhaps yes we are in a bit of a phase of a slowdown into the end of this year but when we look into next year the risks around supply looks so much more acute to us that that does support a bullish oil market case. What about the rise in interest rates? It's something you've written about extensively. The feedback mechanism into the region and this is the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1408,2022-11-21 04:46:12
18795," Bollish oil market case. What about the rise in interest rates? It's something you've written about extensively. The feedback mechanism into the region and this is the JP Morgan spread to Treasuries, which is one of the benchmarks that we look at for golf bonds. What is going to happen to that spread? Do you think a lot of peak fed and the pivot is priced in? I think the market is still quite aspirational, quite hopeful about getting to a pivot. We saw obviously the market implication for where rates go into 2023 come down after the softer than anticipated October CPI print in the United States. And then it's been followed up in the past week by slew of fed speakers saying, no, no, no, we are committed to this hawkish stance. We're committed to killing inflation as much as possible. And so getting to a stance where interest rates in the US are quite restrictive. So perhaps 5% and above, I think still is in play, although we might be getting there at a slower pace. So getting to 50 basis point hike at the December meaning and then maybe a string of smaller rate hikes in 2023. So I don't think we're quite at pivot stance yet. There's a couple more thresholds that I think they need to be crossed before the fed can go to anywhere near an accommodative stance in policy. Fund managers in the meantime are pining into short bets on the dollar by the most since December of 2021. Are you as bearish on the green bet? Well, we did think that a lot of the dollar strength that we saw this year was going to be eroded in 2023. Probably expecting more of that in the second half of the year. It does look like a lot of that has been brought forward. Again, on the kind of reorientation of investor bets following the October CPI. I don't think it's necessarily the wrong call to make, but it might be a little bit premature in our stakes. We expect to see things like the euro sterling start to improve a little bit, not necessarily go off in our strong rally against the dollar, but improve a little bit into 2023. All right, thank you very much for the analysis that's Edward Bell, Senior Director of Market Economics at Emirates and BD, and of course, best of luck to Canada. We say I have much more to come. This is Bloomberg. I'm going to have to go. The multi-trillion dollar industry. There's a lot of ground to cover. Come on. These got absolutely crushed. We'll show you what's happening in ETFs like no one else, Bloomberg ETF IQ Monday on Bloomberg. Let's go, Shair. It was at the UN COP27 climate. Someone have reached a historic last minute deal on payments for climate damages. Let's head out to Bloomberg's Jennifer's opposites who is still in Charmere Shair. This looks like it barely scrapes the boxes, let alone tick boxes. What sentiment like on the ground? Yeah, you said, I mean, on the one hand, people are proud and happy that there was a deal that was reached. Of course, it was a day or two later than what people were expecting, but the significant headline is what we've been hearing from a lot of people that this loss and damage fund was actually agreed upon. If you just think two weeks ago, you...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1409,2022-11-21 04:50:36
18796," The significant headline is what we've been hearing from a lot of people that this lost and damaged fund was actually agreed upon, right? I mean, if you just think two weeks ago, you said you were here. The start of this, it wasn't even formally on the agenda. So the fact that negotiators came together and decided that developing countries did need a fund to help compensate them for the effects of climate change is significant. What is disappointing for a lot of people are a lot of being known surrounding this fund. And there are a lot of them, namely, how it's going to be financed, who is going to be paying for it, who is going to be included in this fund, and when things are actually going to be settled out. And so what we did here from COP27, President Sameshukre, is that there is going to be a transitional committee that is set up to help with this new funding, help get this off the ground, but still a lot of disappointment for some people who are really hoping to see maybe a little bit more stronger text around things like emissions. But this loss in damage is definitely significant for a lot of the developing countries that came here championing this. Jen, what is the mechanism of transmission from this point onwards, chronology agenda? I mean, now that it's kind of coming to an end, who takes over the baton? Right. So Sameshukre is going to pass it off to the UAE, who, as we know, is a big oil and gaps producer. And so there's a lot of activists who are a little bit concerned about what is actually going to happen at that COP28. But the process going into the next 12 months, I mean, it's hard to talk about that, even though, we're still in this top. But there's a lot that's going to happen. I just mentioned that that transitional committee, they're going to meet for the first time in March of 2023 and assign two co-chairs from different countries to actually work on how this fund, this loss in damage fund, is going to be structured and figured out. And so that is going to be really key when we think about COP28 and going into that next climate summit, where a lot of these details are going to need to actually be acted upon. I mean, we talk about this COP27 being implementation, the next COP. A lot of these countries, like Pakistan, we heard a lot from the country and from their climate chief about how she was proud to see that things actually got over the finish line. But now it's actually getting it over there, getting these funds disperse. And also thinking about, with the global energy crisis, what these countries are going to do about scaling back on their own fossil fuel emissions, you see? Jen, thank you for running us through that. That's Jennifer Zabazan at the COP27 summit in Egypt. We reported earlier about Bob Iger making potentially a comeback at Disney. Well, maybe it's not going to be that easy because Tri-N has over $800 million of a stake in Disney. And as the Wall Street Journal reports, they are opposing the return of Robert Iger as its CEO. This is citing sources. Tri-N is likely to boost the stake further and pushed for additional cost cuts. They're going to seek a board seat and operations improvements. So that sets up a battle with activist investor Nelson Pelz and his fund. Clearly, some strong moves that is going to leave the market with a lot to discuss and consider for a company that's really gone through a lot throughout 2022. We've got much more coverage ahead. This is Bloomberg. Hey, so you've got to explain this one to me. What does it mean when the White House says we're watching markets carefully? It means they have a Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg.

What does it mean? What does it mean? It means they have a Bloomberg. We were talking about the World Cup quite a bit and you think about travel and the price of booking it ticket these days and what came to my mind is some of the TSA there that we got out of the United States and it tells a story of a relative moderation given the strong rebound we had after the re-opening we'll kind of the feature of 2021 you take a look at the back end of that chart towards the end of 2022 and you can see how it kind of begins to level off a little bit and that is something to bear in mind as we begin to calculate different scenarios for a recession and how those could ripple through the demand side of the equation from there I take you to equity futures in the United States on this Monday we are called a little bit lower about three tenths of one percent bear in mind that we had of course quite a bit of nervousness around what is going on with COVID-0 and some cities that were meant to re-opening clearly not re-opening as fast and in some cases even closing down again a city with as many as 11 million people and that goes contrary to a lot of the optimism that was priced in over the last two weeks in terms of trading activity from equity futures I take you to treasuries as well as we think about what the Fed may do over the next couple of meetings US-10s I've kind of consolidated around the key level 380 379 52 as we speak and from treasuries I take you to Brent Crude which is front and center this morning both because of the price move itself coming off the back of severe losses over the last trading week and now down 1% in today just building on those losses and getting ever closer to the $85 a barrel mark the Goldman Sachs note is a bit of a wake up call that maybe it's time to revisit a lot of the assumptions that you would have had three or four weeks ago and we will of course debate that throughout the morning we haven't talked about Bitcoin and Ethereum as much as we have talked about FTX so that's what we're going to do now and the risk off narrative really feeding into the straight as well we're so holding about $16,000 which is notable given some of the developments over the weekend and the exposure of certain unchecked creditors at FTX or 2 FTX rather which is one of the most red stories of the morning the coverage continues from Dubai from Doha from London and the rest of the world I'm going to be rooting for Switzerland but they're not playing until Thursday so I have to put my cap in my t-shirt sort of to decide for the moment minus joins me in a couple of minutes this is Bloomberg",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1411,2022-11-21 04:59:26

Floating solar rays have been gaining traction in Asia, including countries like Singapore and Thailand. Floating projects typically benefit from an easier connection to the power grid. They can also restrict algae blooms while keeping the solar panels cool. This one in particular has healthy local economy. When the power plant was first proposed, residents were given the chance to invest. Some locals were also offered jobs during construction. In fact, it was the community that requested the panels to be shaped as flowers to look more appealing. South Korea still relies heavily on imported fossil fuels, but will need to change that to reach its goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2050. Solar plants like this one may help the country reach its net zero goals. PSO now is your online home for weekly Boston Symphony Orchestra and Boston Pops performances.

This is public day break, so our top story is this morning. China reports its first COVID deaths in almost six months as cases spike, while another city rumored to be a test case for reopening season lockdowns return. Stocks in Hong Kong and the mainland tumble on the news. The fallout from the collapse of FDX continues. New court papers show that the bankrupt crypto conglomerate owes more than $3 billion to its top 50 unsecured creditors.

And the football world cup finally kicks out from Qatar with a lavish opening ceremony after a build-up that's been marred by controversy were live in Doha for the latest. Just got 9 a.m. across the ever time. I'm used to gment a dean in Dubai. And I'm Manuskriani right back alongside you. So where is Switzerland placed? Going to win? Well, we're playing Cameroon on Thursday. So that's the match I'm looking at. You got a bet on that. Did you make the opening ceremony? I don't think we made it to the cup or to the opening ceremony.

18799," Money is flowing in. 23 billion dollars flowed into equity funds globally up until November the 16th. But of course, the view and the reason why I've put Europe on the bottom of this, of this board is that you're seeing redemptions for the 40th consecutive week from the equity markets in Europe, which they're going to go health a leather really in terms of rate hikes. Or is it the bottom of your screen, Yersif, down 9% last week, Goldman's cutting their view on the fourth quarter oil price for Brent down to 100 bucks. Downed by $10, they say you are right to be anxious. And of course, all of that OPEC plus boost has evaporated. That $12 shot to the moon post the meeting is gone. Yeah, I want to take you from the energy and equity space to the Treasury's market. This are the different 10 years US 10s at 3, 79 71. What stood out to me is that a lot of strategists in the Bloomberg survey are really focused on the Fed minutes in terms of the next potential catalyst for rates. On the credit side of things, GTV go for our clients because what we're seeing is basically black rock with a note out on a rotation into credit funds as investors return forth quarter inflows into credit funds have been surging under cooling inflation data signals that we could get us slowing in the Fed interest rate increases. I want to get to iron ore as well, the other standout in the commodity space sinking after three weeks of gains. You talked about it, Manesty cloud around some of the COVID restrictions in China. That is dampening the demand outlook. And that of course gets rippled into the iron ore trade almost immediately. We're down as much as 4% at one point. Currently we're down 1.4% in today. Yeah, there's an interesting chance to really do tell the story of volatility. There is a lot to deal with this morning. Let's get to Annabelle Druders. She's in Hong Kong with the Asian market wrap. There's no doubt about it. There's a sense of Fibrile China story out there in terms of the risk to another massive lockdown or shot in in Beijing. Annabelle. Yeah, that's right, Manesty trading activity today. Just definitely telling us that any road to recovery in China is going to be a tough one to trade. So that's certainly the major overarching theme for us. But broadly, we're risk off in the session today. You can see here on this board also just really paying attention to what's ahead in terms of the Fed. Given we do have those FMC minutes due this week and more Fed officials including Susan Collins, the Boston Fed president saying that she could still be on board for a 75 basis point move in December. But in terms of what else are watching Malaysia is very much in focus for us today, given that the country did produce its first ever hung parliament at the weekend in the vote. So none of the three major alliances won enough seats to form a majority here. So the clock really just ticking now four party leaders to inform the king of their choice of who will be the next prime minister and the alliances that have formed that is due in less than an hour now. But let's change it on take a look at where we are as Chinese markets come back from the lunch break. We are continuing to see losses here across the board, particularly noticeable in the tech space. You can see here, but also the H.S. index is a decline today of 3.7% at one stage, but taking the monthly rally here to just around 20%. So does really come at a very interesting time, you said, of course, because we have seen a lot more Wall Street banks turning bullish once again. And about thank you for that. That's Annabelle Dhrulers there. We'll let check back in with you later on the program. I want to talk more about China because the country reported its first COVID fatality since May as cases spike nationwide. Hightening concerns that cities including the capital could see a return to tougher restrictions. Let's bring in Rachel Chang, who leads our Asia consumer and health media team. Rachel, what are the parameters that our global investing audience need to look at to better understand how meaningfully the situation has changed on the ground? Right. I mean, I think really what the realization is settling in for global investors is, you know, there's not really a plan happening in China right now. You know, we had this so-called easing, you know, telling officials they can't be doing disruptive lockdowns. They can't be doing mass testing that are really turning people's lives upside down. But at the same time, well, then how do you stop the exponential spread of COVID? Like we know that Armicon spreads very quickly in a COVID-19 population as China is. We know that winter is coming cold weather setting in, and that's the favorite conditions for the virus. So of course, what you're seeing is, you know,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1413,2022-11-21 05:07:56
18800," Quickly in a COVID-19 population as China is we know that winters come in cold weather setting in and that's the favorite conditions for the virus So of course what you're seeing is you know spread really kick off in all of these major cities But officials not having those tools that they had previously Haribas is the data Rachel we're looking here Beijing reported three COVID deaths over the weekend and that's the first documented Death since May That's right, you know the cases in Beijing are really a low number for a city of over 20 million You know about 400 500 cases a day the fact that we're seeing these fatalities come so soon, you know in that outbreak Really shows the vulnerability of the Chinese population We know that for example the population of 80 years old and above only 40% of them have gotten booster shots So you know this is a country of 1.4 billion people which has not really been infected by COVID at all for the last two and a half years Leaving you know really millions of vulnerable elderly and that is going to be a major concern for China as it contemplates opening up Okay Rachel. Thank you very much. It's certainly shaking the markets this morning Let's see what the reaction function actually is Rachel there with the very latest Well the 2022 World Cup has kicked off in Kanta and the lavish opening ceremony Before the match between the hosts and Ecuador made the TV screens last night. It's a combination of 12 years of a build up It's been marbled by controversy over human rights and the environmental impact Simone's on the ground She was there for the pre the pre build up you were in the stands last night It was looking to your Instagram at lucky you you got the ticket you didn't tell the rest of us. No, what's going on? Where is cat ours ability to massive the event because it looks spectacular? It was spectacular and particularly the opening ceremony Very intense music the presence of a singer from the South Korean pop group BTS and overall I think this showed Qatar's ability at least the we at least had one Example here of its ability to host a major sporting event. Yes, there were some issues There was a lot of traffic getting there because this is not a stadium connected to the metro system But these are maybe growing pains that the country can sort out as this tournament Continues the play not as exciting Ecuador really dominant from the beginning ultimately coming away two scores to nil Against Qatar and we did see fans start leaving before the end of the second half But really the focus as with so much of the world cup and most so much of our world cup coverage What was happening off the field? We saw a lot of regional leaders in attendance crown prince Mohammed bin Salman He was seated next to FIFA president Gianni Infantino Maybe talking about the potential for a Saudi world cup We also saw a picture of President Erdogan of Turkey shaking hands with the Egyptian president seemingly for the very first time Showing Qatar's diplomatic might I mean one thing that didn't make sense to me in what was a very glamorous opening ceremony It was a part with with floating jerseys. I don't know who came up with that But nonetheless an initial success for Qatar, but that doesn't take away from some of the major Problems that have marred this event and the hosting of this event. How have some of the corporate Sponsors taken position either for or against some of these issues? Yeah, I did a survey here of 76 corporate sponsors either based in North America so Canada US or in Europe where criticism of the world cup has been particularly vehement We also surveyed as several seven FIFA sponsors based in those same countries and the message I came away with is Yes, there's been all this criticism of the human rights abuses in Qatar But companies are really not changing their tune in terms of global advertising strategy 13 companies mainly in Belgium Denmark and the Netherlands did say they they sort of got together as a group and said We're we're gonna change the way we do this. We're not gonna send our clients. We're not gonna go ourselves To the world cup, but only three of them had even tenuous a business ties to the country And so the vast majority of companies",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1414,2022-11-21 05:12:10
18801," ourselves to the world cup, but only three of them had even tenuous business ties to the country. And so the vast majority of companies looking at the five billion eyeballs that may be on this tournament and saying, well, we really want those eyeballs. We want that advertising. And we're not, as much as we've talked about social impact, ESG, that's not really going to affect us. And we're not going to talk about that publicly. Simone, thank you for that. We will, of course, be checking back in with you many, many times throughout the week. That's a small foxman at the kind of financial center in Doha for a change. She's used it to stadium, so, you know, a bit of a shift. I want to get to FDX minus four a minute because a new publication that tells us a story, A, of top 50 unchecked creditors having about $3.1 billion in exposure. But as much as it's redacted in terms of details of who and how much we're still able to clean details off from it, right? Yeah, I mean, the question you need to ask yourself, some of the most sophisticated investors in the world with some of the best due diligence teams in the world still managed to invest in FDX, but then it's only as good as the information that you're given 50 claims of between 21 and a quarter of a billion. One thing that caught my eyes at John J. Ray who's been visceral in terms of the risk control and the risk management actually said that he's found some solvent-balanced sheets within the FDX family, regulated or licensed subsidiaries of FDX within and outside the US have solvent-balanced sheets and he's found 50 million in cash. Yeah, so FDX said it has assets and liabilities of at least $10 billion each in preliminary court papers. The case may involve more than one million creditors according to lawyers at FDX. Yeah, I mean, the whole world of crypto, I mean, Bitcoin itself is what? 16,000, we made it time, sub-16,000 this morning, so there's a little bit more risk off around the world. We'll check in on those cryptos through the morning. Let's get to the first word headlines from around the world now and get you up to speed. Climate negotiators in Egypt have struck a deal that resets the relationship between the rich and poor countries approved without a single opposing voice. Now the agreement creates a fund that helps developing nations face the devastation of climate change. Although the deal is a historic victory, negotiators failed to secure commitments for more ambitious cuts to greenhouse gas emissions. The US and China have resumed formal talks on climate change. China's climate head voice says that the two countries agreed to discuss how to address the losses and damages developing nations are experiencing as a consequence of climate change, but he also says a new deal should mirror the Paris agreement. Turkey has carried out strikes against the US-backed Kurdish militant groups in Iraq. And Northern Syria. The defense ministry says the raids were to eliminate what it called the terrorist threat and come after a deadly bombing that targeted civilians in Istanbul. The offensive could shore up the flagging domestic support for the Turkish president, Rasa Puerdoan, ahead of the elections next year. The UN's atomic agency says powerful blasts have shaken the area around the separation nuclear power plant. This includes more than a dozen on Sunday morning, the IAEA says some buildings and systems were damaged, but non-critically, the rains nuclear regulator says Russian forces struck the facility, but Russia's army issued a statement, Lenny, you crane for the shunning. Those were your first word headlines. We're coming up on the show, strategy with Gulf investments. Rafael Bertone joins us in just a moment. This is Bloomberg.

18802," China's military power has been growing at an incredible speed over the last 20 years. A strong country must have a strong military, as only then can it guarantee the security of the nation. In terms of sphere of influence, we absolutely know that China wants to be dominant in Asia. So there is a target to get to that point, to be a military that is appear to the greatest militaries in the world by 2035. The competition for influence is a global one. And through a multi-decade trajectory fueled by planning, money, and pragmatism, China is building a military that allows it to shape the 21st century just as the US shaped the 20th. Multi-trillion dollar industry. There's a lot of ground to cover. Come on, these guys got absolutely crushed! We'll show you what's happening in ETFs like no one else. Bloomberg ETF IQ. Monday on Bloomberg. I think that the Fed has this in the right place when it says that they're going to move up somewhat more, and they're going to take stock of the situation. I have to say that if they hadn't made as many mistakes as they did of excessive optimism about inflation, they'd probably have a little more room than they do. Never far from a criticism of the Federal Reserve. The Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, speaking to Bloomberg TV, as you can see, you're looking at the probability of some rate hikes coming through there. You've got St. Louis Fed President. James Bullard has signaled hikes will roll on. A land of Fed President Rafael Bostic says he favors slowing the pace of interest rate increases. What does Rafael A? But Tony, make of that, Gulf Investment Corps head of debt capital markets. Rafael A, listening to Larry Summers, he'll be here in Dubai a little bit later on. I'll moderate him. So I'll see what he makes of. The market thinks it's 5%. He thinks that's too low. But he does think that we're past the big moves of this cycle were near the finishing off. Now, incrementally, everybody's debating whether we're at all near a peak from the Fed, given what you've just heard from Larry Bostic and Bullard, where do you think a reasonable top is? Good morning, Manus. Good morning, you sir. I shared the view that the terminal rate should be something around 5% or 5% or 4%. We had a very strong set of rate increases in the US. But my suspicious is that the Fed will remain in all case in order to keep monetary conditions in an restrictive way. So financial condition must remain in a negative territory in order to avoid any market, the subarance, and in order to make this, I can cycle effective in fighting inflation. I mean, we'll get more of the Fed minutes in the next couple of days, just ahead of Thanksgiving holiday, the long weekend, to give investors a bit more context on potential Fed moves. But in terms of the reaction function from the market, this is a note, Manus flagged to me from BlackRock. Basically, they're seeing a rotation into credit funds with investors returning. We have the full chart on the terminal, G2B go for our clients. It's the fourth quarter, seeing quite a bit of inflows, and both high grade and junk end of credit are looking appealing. Do you agree with that view? Absolutely, Yusuf. As you remember, we have highlighted the appealing of the credit market for a couple of months now. The total return of fixing assets in general, being one of the worst in many decades. And that way the inflation leaking.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1416,2022-11-21 05:20:51
18803," total return of fixing camassets in general in one of the worst in many decades and with the inflation, peaking and the monetary policy, I think, cycle, peaking, we see value in fixing camassets in particular credit. We have, we expected in 2023, a positive total return of around that 67% for investment-grade corporate bonds and around 5% of ore yield, which is only a recover of 50% of what they lost in 2022. So there are reasons, fundamental reasons, technical reasons to be bullish and I'm not surprised to see big inflows in credit, a bunch of funds. Ravela, you called for a mild recession as and when it comes, the yield curve is perhaps screaming for something a little bit more brutal. But I want to look at the savings rate, the elixir of life, the money they saved in the US and around the world during the pandemic, during the fiscal largest. The savings rate was 17% in 2020, the highest on record, were now sub 4% growth for 7 months in a row at the lowest savings rates since 2008. I put it to you that there's landing, it could be a little bit more brutal than the soft one that you've got in the pipeline. That's a very good point. We know how much important consumer confidence is for the global economy, especially in the US and in the Europe. Obviously, inflation has been brutal this year and consumers are on the defensive side. But the current saving rate is not very far from the average of the past 10 years. So it should stabilize around this level and don't forget that in many countries there are still very accommodative fiscal policies that should be a support for the economy. Rafael, the top investors that we've been speaking to are struggling to get their head around what is happening in China. Zero COVID reopening and clearly there's a huge gulf between those two scenarios. What kind of narrative would you succinctly compress the China story into for clients this morning? That's a very very interesting question, you know, as your colleague before said that the reopening trade, it's a very difficult one timing. The reopening in China is difficult because of the size of the country and because of the low rate of vaccination in the population. On top of that, there are other structural issues for China. First of all, the anger in the property market and the percentage of the increase in export in the economy is slowing down significantly. So the two major economic engine of the country, the property sector and the export sector are suffering at the moment. That's suggested to be still on the defensive side, despite the recommendation or the cheapness of the market. And that's the strategy where we are still. We need to have some confirmation on the COVID side and on the new strategy for the economy before investing. Okay, so you need a little bit more convinced. You are incrementally adding risk. What is the biggest risk position that you are adding to? We've heard your credit view, but where else? Briefly, are you adding to risk? We are adding US investment grade, corporate bonds, US yield and emerging market. Even Europe is becoming interesting. We try to avoid the sector most cyclical and in favor of the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1417,2022-11-21 05:25:05
18804," energy market, even Europe is becoming interesting. We try to avoid the sector more cyclical and in favor of the financial sector banks are cheaper and in particular subordinated debt is attractive. All right, straight to the point. Kind of to sum up your conviction views. Thank you for that. That's Rafael Bertoni, the Gulf Investment Corporation head of debt capital markets. Thanks again for your time. So have much more to come on the show. This is Bloomberg. Welcome to Unison Tא Film Festival worth $0.00 elect. How much of a push have you seen from the Kishida government in terms of green funding? The Kishida administration has committed to doubling the amount of investments in so-called green technologies. I think we need more than just pronouncements. We need real money backing, very innovative startups and innovative companies in this space. What do you make of Kishida's new capitalism? Well, I think he is framework is reflective of the challenges that Japan society is facing, namely, that growth has been present, but growth has not been, of course, evenly distributed. But frankly speaking, it's hard to register the income if you don't have a income to begin with, that the government and private sector can work together and collaborate to drive more innovative growth startups that can really drive the income growth that the Kishida government needs to redistribute. Information you want, analysis, you trust. Everything you need to get set for this start of U.S. trading. Watch Bloomberg the Open with Jonathan Terrell. We gaze on Bloomberg. Roe Roe, risk off. And as you can see, we're risk off in equities this morning money. It's nips into the dollar this morning. But again, it goes back to this peak dollar narrative. You got the fund managers piling into dollar shorts. The most since July 2021, the hedge ones are selling the dollar for five straight weeks and that exceptionalism premium is receding according to ANZ on the GMM map. You see that the dollar is up, but it is the yuan which takes the weight in terms of the heaviness in the Asian market effects wrap. You can see the remember there, Yusuf Daan along with the South Korean one as well as the tie bat, those exceptional moves. Yeah, it's one of those days where we have dollar, the king dollar, making a bit of a return. But in terms of the crude oil trade, Goldman Sachs out with a note, I love a juicy note on a Monday morning. So fourth quarter, 2022, the forecast for Brent gets cut by $10 a barrel. That's down to $100 a barrel. They're seeing the possibility of fertile lockdowns. But at the same time, they're seeing Russia potentially draining inventory before the start of this EU curb on seaborn flows. That is expected to start next month from there that's rolled it over to equities, futures, reflecting the broader market costlessness.

18805," Qiu Former The top names in climate change are on Bloomberg. Building out local wind, local solar, hydrogen, these are solutions to not just climate issues but geopolitical issues. We are in position by 2030 to 80% of all electricity generated by wind. The bubbles are the safest, the cleanest and the cheapest form of energy. Today especially for countries such as Greece. Nobody covers climate change like Bloomberg, your global business authority. We will never break, we will never break. Build on our foundation strong enough to stay. We will never, no, we will never, no. It's been Bloomberg, daybreak, Middle East, our top stories this morning. Beijing reports two more COVID fatalities as cases spike while another city rumored to be a test case for reopening. Seize lockdowns return. The fallout from the collapse of FTX continues. New cool papers show the bankrupt crypto conglomerate owes more than $3 billion to its top 50 unsecured creditors. Climate negotiators in Egypt have struck a deal on climate justice but the final compromise left a big doubt over the prospect for new efforts to curb emissions. In the world's biggest single sporting event, the football world cup has begun in Qatar with a lavish opening ceremony were live to Doha. Let's check back in on how the markets are fairing in Asia and through the restores of the Hong Kong studio. You said we are into the afternoon session here for trading this Monday in Asia and so far we are looking quite risky. Of course you can see a lot of red behind the screen but two main factors that play here. So in the first you have China and I will get to that in just a moment but also the Fed because of course we do have those FOMC minutes due this week and it's going to give us more clues on the sides and the scope of Fed rate hanks ahead. So ahead of that we are seeing Bonnual looking a failing mixed in the trading session today but also giving an eye on what's happening with the dollar because more strength coming back into the currency and that is sending some in Asia law particularly the Korean one. It actually had been one of the standout performance in Asia so far this quarter up around 6% over the period. In terms of what we are seeing in the equities picture as well keeping an eye on what we see in Malaysia we are seeing it declining and also the Malaysian ring it today. Jules of course is in Malaysia for us in Kuwait, Lumpur for the results of the election on the weekend so more details in just a moment but essentially the first hung parliament ever that is basically the worst case scenario for investors. But let's change on now and get to the other big story which is China of course because we did see the first fatalities from COVID in several months at the weekend and also more regions now starting to lock down again and so that is really hitting reopening stocks in particular.

18806," particular a chowtie fork one of them for instance the retailer of jewellery down around nearly 10% at one stage but airlines airports tourism all very much in focus manners And I mean the question is I mean there was such bullishness last week in terms of you know time to Reenter China taking incremental risk get involved in it. What are the analysts saying right now? Yeah, that's right, man. That's it was quite an interesting about a turn that came last week It has really been pretty much whipsawed from Wall Street over the past few months as to whether you should be buying into this But definitely it seems that sentiment is once back again in favor of China Even with this latest sell-off to city group is one of them saying that essentially this is a good entry point for investors and basically that we have this reopening at least To ostensibly officials are committed to easing somewhat from COVID-0 You also have that ongoing support for the property sector. So these two factors Combine really support the current EPS downturn and then also help Investors sentiment that though are adding a caveat here that they're not going to be chasing this rally aggressively That's one story Bank of America is another out with a note just in the last couple of hours and again They're saying that in the short term. Yes, we can expect more volatility This is not an easy exit from COVID-0. We know it's a rough path ahead But certainly in the longer term. This is attractive manners Absolutely. Thank you for that. That's an anable drulu is there Well, let's get to the Malaysian story manners apologies. I'm so keen to get there No, no problem. I mean we've got students on the grind there and we have less than an hour to go Before they're due to inform the king of their choice of prime minister That's after Saturday's election failed to produce a clear winner. Jules is on the ground in quarter-lump So Jules where do we stand? There's quite a visceral market reaction The news from where you are Yeah, absolutely as Annabelle mentioned in matters the Malaysia facing its first ever hung parliament It's actually less than 30 minutes. So 2 p.m Malaysian time is the deadline. We're just after 130 now and what an extraordinary election this has been so you have The long ruling bursian national coalition which has basically been in power in some form or another for most of Malaysia's 57-year independence now it didn't win enough seats to form a government But it's pretty much going to be the king maker here in terms of who it gives its seats to and then who they are going to Form this alliance. So will it be the 75 year old opposition leader unwa ibrahim who is leading the more reformist Pakistan Harapan party or will be and give their 30 seats to the pro Malay PN party which has 73 seats now either needs 111 to form a majority BN had earlier asked the king for a little bit more flexibility in this 2 p.m. deadline Unlikely we are going to have that so in about 30 minutes We should hopefully hear some kind of indication as to who is going to lead Malaysia's next government become the fourth Prime Minister in as many years and worth noting use of manners that 97-year-old Mahatya Muhammad who has been Malaysia's longest serving a Prime Minister his first tenure was 22 years he lost his seat his Lancaui seat in Saturday's election ending his political career We have remarkable footage coming through over the last few hours. You've been on the ground for A few days you've had a chance to speak to some of the people there It's just give us a bit of an overview of what stood out to you in terms of dominant concerns among voters Yeah, well, it's about the economy You said if it's about rising prices I mean many cannot afford to put food on the table You have the average national minimum salary per month that 1500 ringate the central bank itself said back in 2018 Couple should have 4500 ringate a month or 6500 if they have children just to put that in context 1500 ringate a month is about 329 dollars We've also had the rising cost of chicken which is a key staple of the Malaysian diet Really rise above the government's price cap as well of $2.7 US per kilo And you have these rising inflationary pressures just really hurting the overall Malaysians at the same time You've seen foreign investment really decline as well and the Malaysian market as we're seeing very much hit today But down about 24% from its 2018 peak a week ringate to it that 24-year-long",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1420,2022-11-21 05:38:15
18807, really decline as well and the Malaysian market as we're seeing very much hit today but down about 24% from its 2018 peak a week ringer to at that 24 year low not good news for Malaysia which is a net food import and minus use of. Jules thank you for that excellent reporting it will be one of the top stories throughout the day and that is Julie's Silent Live in Singapore. Let's get to the 2022 World Cup but it's kicked off in Qatar with a lavish opening ceremony and a match between the host and Ecuador Ecuador 1 2 0 on the well-emaked performance by the hosts in their first outing Bloomberg symbol Foxman has been watching from the stands. I'm a bit surprised that Manus hasn't hooked me up yet with some of the VIP tickets but let's put it aside to ring compliance for that but that aside for a moment tell us about what the first match was like on the ground what did you see what was special. Yeah we might have an issue with standards on that I mean look it was a very exciting opening ceremony certainly the match a little less so but certainly a good atmosphere in the stands for most of the game until some of particularly the Qatar supporters left as it became clear who was going to win. But I was also watching the atmosphere outside the stadium. I went and visited a bunch of fan zones fan areas yesterday and I found a pretty seduced atmosphere frankly not a lot of people milling about normally we expect some kind of party for the World Cup and so far we haven't quite seen it yet that said the opening match was rescheduled a day earlier and a lot of people by the time that time had already booked their travel flight so maybe they're just not here yet. Didn't see any of those flashpoint issues around public drunkenness or around protests protests perhaps of LGBTQ rights again these are things we're going to be watching for hopefully as more people arrive and as we get really into the thick of things in the group stage matches. Yeah I mean I'm very contentious runner but it's interesting how a lot of the broadcasters seem to pivot to the football rather than the issues you know as momentum got going those issues won't go away Simone I'm sure but let's get back to sport what are we watching for today. Yeah well we're certainly waiting for the excitement to kind of pick up on the ground but there are some big matches going on today I'll be at USA Wales this evening there's also going to be a big game between Netherlands and Senegal those are the two top teams expected to lead in that specific group but I think all eyes really going to be on England versus Iran so the Iranian team has been team Mellie has been a united force for the Iranian people over the past couple of decades but now the reaction to these matches is really divided we've seen lots of activists supporters of the demonstrators in Iran coming out saying we don't want to celebrate and in fact some of them called for Iran to be banned from this world cup altogether we've also heard about some divided views within the Iranian team itself so we're going to be watching for any even subtle gestures perhaps in support of the protest moving going on in Iran but we're also going to be watching the English team as well the English team supposed to take in me ahead of the tournament and support of LGBTQ rights and the big question mark does Captain Harry Kane wear his one love arm band even though he may be immediately booked for doing so we will be watching out for that also watching out to see how sponsors respond to his decision yeah that has been a great deal made over the armband and a number of sportsmen and women who have accepted a lot of fees in support of the world cup and a lot of protests around that Simone I'm sure we will talk about this continually throughout throughout the games as well as the football Simone Foxme the Catafanancial Centre in Doha let's talk about the Marcus Nile equities to be precise Farah Abrahi is around the desk with Yusuf and myself this morning we're never far from an IPO front are we what are we IPO we know can we IPO Sheikh Zayed Road can we IPO the fun run on Sheikh Zayed Road I was just one great tonight yes pretty phenomenal pretty phenomenal led by,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1421,2022-11-21 05:42:30
18808," The IPO ain't no, can we IPO Shake's Aid Road? Can we IPO the fun run on Shake's Aid Road? I was just wondering, great try night, yes. There was, was it? Pretty phenomenal, pretty phenomenal led by Prince Hamdan. Pretty major, yes, pretty on Shake's Aid. I'm not sure about the plans to do with the IPO there, but I can tell you about Talium in the private sector. That's a private school operator. They had demand of about $4 billion for, again, a small company, a private company. So, seems that the man is not just for the public company here in Dubai. We have the CEO in here the other week. He just didn't even answer anything. They're getting pretty good, doesn't he? Yeah, they're getting, yeah. Big shout out to Taneo, how are you trying to see or not to answer a question? Well, Talium raised us, 150 million there, Hamza. Yeah, they did well last week, and we'll keep an eye out for the listing, of course, after Empower last week, also had a green debut, so they're still a bit of appetite there. But also, we have Americana increasing the retail size of its IPO in terms of how much it contributes to the overall size. So, it is pretty interesting. It's been up to 10% from 5%. So, the retail part is growing. It's going to be an important part of the investments here in the IPO for the region. What about some of the Egyptian stocks? You're flying a Cairo. I think a few hours. How have they been holding up after the devaluation? They got a bit of a boost, didn't they? They got quite a boost, you see. For now, the highest since February 2020, so we've erased those pandemic losses. We're green for the year. And the market is firmly in bullish mode. Certainly, there is a little bit of protecting, you know, against inflation that we're seeing in Egypt. But at the same time, if you just take a look at which stocks are leading gains in Egypt, you have commercial and international bank, Fawri. These are financial stocks. So, again, with the higher interest rates, they're poised to benefit. But also, we have the exporters, especially the fertiliser stocks. They're also right at the top of the leading gains on the EGX-34 that period, since the pound has been devalued. Again, with a pound of 24 pounds, like we were just discussing before the show, $24 per dollar. Yeah, that's, it makes exporters pretty attractive to investors. I can imagine the conversation, as we get ready, to go to OPEC, which is, I told you also, from the Saudis in terms of having made the two million barrels a day cut, but oil is under pressure. A lot of that is tied to China. So, how is that played out in terms of the market impact for us here? Well, you can see over the last five days in the market, Manus. Yeah, the Gulf equity markets have been hit quite a bit. So, you can see that the correlation between our markets here and oil is still pretty high. We saw weakness, especially in Qatar, out of all places. I know that the focus right now is all on the World Cup there, but the equity market took a little bit of a dip. We're 16% down from the peak we saw earlier this year. So, not quite at a bare market yet, but we'll keep an eye out there. Also Saudi Arabia, down again, last week, and still negative for the year after being a market leader, not just in the region, but globally over the past two years. So, if oil prices continue to pull back, it's going to be a problem for equity markets, not truly, but also, yeah, OPEC is one to keep an eye out on. But thank you very much for highlighting some of those topics. It's fun to have fun all the way there. So, I'd much more to come on Daybreak with Lace.

18809," Anytime! 2022 World Cup will be carbon neutral, but environmentalists are raising alarms as the event kicks off, saying the event has been called greenwash that will add millions of megatons of CO2 to the atmosphere. In 2010 FIFA announced that Qatar would host the 2022 World Cup. In its bid, the country promised to make it a carbon neutral tournament. But as the matches approach, environmentalists are claiming that Qatar has greenwash the World Cup and that the event will put millions of megatons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. That claim is mostly a PR play. Essentially, there is no way that a mega event of that size can be carbon neutral. FIFA can do better and should do better. And my focus would be on encouraging to do that for the next World Cup. The UN defines carbon neutrality or achieving net zero carbon emissions as balancing a measured amount of carbon released with an equal amount offset. First step is to measure your emissions and so that's what FIFA has done for the World Cup. We looked into that calculation and we think that this is quite significantly underestimated. So there's two big challenges with any carbon neutrality claim at an event of this size. The first one is travel. And the second part of this is construction. 75% of the carbon footprint of all sports stadium over their entire lifetime is locked in on day one from the materials that built from. It's not about operating costs. It's about concrete steel. Qatar has invested billions of dollars in infrastructure for the tournament, including building seven new stadiums. Organizers estimate that the World Cup will emit 3.6 megatons of carbon dioxide. The construction of the stadium is the most problematic elements because it's the element that we think was most massively underestimated. From that factor, we think the total footprint would be 5 million tons. International flights in and out of Doha will account for the majority of emissions. However, organizers argue that this World Cup will be more energy efficient than others since fans won't have to fly to different venues and can instead just take public transit. The sticking point is always the flights. Most Olympics and World Cups, it accounts to more than 85% of total emissions. Balancing carbon emissions with offsets is key to carbon neutrality. So far, Qatar has purchased less than 350,000 carbon offset credits of the 3.6 million needed in their estimation. The Supreme Committee says that it has already secured a minimum of 1.5 million credits from the Global Carbon Council and that further details will be forthcoming. So far, greenwashing issues are not keeping fans from rooting for their teams on the pitch. An estimated 1.7 million people will be in attendance with over 3 million tickets sold. But with a warmer future ahead, effects on fans will soon be felt. Sport is the most enormous opportunity to tackle the climate crisis because we can engage football fans and make them advance to the environment through their favourite sport.

18811," Out of those dialogues, I think that's something we're going to have to wait and see. We in the United States probably need to be careful about our evangelizing influence. I don't think it's really for us to tell China how they should organize their entire society. I think it's for us to stand up for some of our fundamental interests in security, and fair economic competition, but to leave it at that point. I think we're going to need to be very careful with respect to our diplomacy. I catch up with the US Treasury Secretary Larry. Some is a little bit later on today. I'll push him forward on some of those comments on his views on China. And rates, but to the markets. The markets are hesitant this morning. You've got Beijing reporting to more COVID deaths. You've got real fear that more curbs could come to capital records, 951 COVID cases a year. And that is the pervasive theme across risk this morning. Iron ore dying. You're looking at this whole reopening narrative last week. We had euphoria over the 16 point plan on how to rebuild China. Rebuild the opening. Copperstein, iron ore stone. The member is done and the dollar is strong. Yeah, so that's something Rafael Bertoni was talking about earlier when he was sharing his views on how to really get a better understanding of the world between COVID-0 and reopening. It's a huge golf. It varies from region to region within China. But as we think about the lockdowns, I'm also considering this chart. GTV go for our clients, the TSA checkpoints throughput. And we've had a strong rebound throughout 2021 as some of the reopening took place. And you can see how some of that traffic passenger data is beginning to level off a little bit as we get into the year end of 2022 rising costs, the potential of a pronounced recession. And then also the rising energy prices, which is weighing on the ability of consumers to be able to navigate a lot of these headwinds. The Bloomberg Dollar Index is in focus. You talked about the movement of capital into Haven. That is something I'm looking at as well. Quick snapshot of what is going on in the oil market. I bring you the front spread. Why do we look at that? This is the front two contracts. And you can see just the complete obliteration. In other words, demand under pressure as Brent falls to $87 this morning, down 9% last week. This Chinese news will reverberate not just in the very front end of the contracts, but also as we go to Vienna. What will the Saudis lobby for with the Emirates and the rest of OPEC plus in terms of additional cuts? Goldman's cut the price of Brent for the fourth quarter by $10 to $100. So there's pressure on the front spreads. Yeah, and then equity futures in the US call a little bit lower about the third of 1% as we begin this trading week with China Front Center and at the same time, of course, to Fed Minutes in a shortened Thanksgiving holiday week. This is Bloomberg. The Tres de Monte is one of this 700th anniversary of Dante, Allegheri's death, has triggered the work of many institutions and offered a very rich schedule of events.

18812," Today in Santa Crochet, we present one of these projects that suffered a difficult start because COVID-19 has stopped the project that was shared by the opera de Santi Crochet by the Franciscan community from Florence Municipality and the fun for religious building of the internal minister. Today, Felice Limousani's project is finally enjoyable. In the Pazi Chapel, the marvelous architecture by Felipe Brunelleschi, the most important images from the Divine Comedy created by the French illustrator Guzdoff Dore. Through these images, we can live the violent emotions of hell, the weight of purgatory and the sublime joy of paradise. The digital humanities are a cultural occasion to exploit. Summing up, it's about merging humanistic disciplines with new technologies. I find this to be an innovating and modern tool to update culture. Cultural heritage becomes something to hand over to the new generations and not to be put aside, so it's about using technology, pixels, and binary code with a human and humanizing content. The US Treaty Watch Bloomberg the Open with Jonathan Ferrell. The US Treaty Watch is on Bloomberg. This is Bloomberg Daybreak Europe. I'm Tom McKenzie in London with Manus Cranny in Dubai and these are the stories that set your agenda. COVID-0 concerns stocks drop treasuries and the dollar gain as China tightens the curves and mid-a-resurgence of the virus, including the first fatalities since May. The US Treaty Watch is a global news conference, seeking the old magic Bob Iger returns as the Disney CEO hoping to stem the show's West Performance since at least the 1970s. Historic agreement, negotiators at COP27 reaching the 11th hour deal for the fund that compensates developing nations for climate devastation that falls short on fossil fuels. We're live to Shamosha. Tom, good to have you with me this morning. We are back to paranoia about what happens next in China. As we see in the COVID cases rise in the capital. Tom, good morning. Yeah, good morning, Manus. Absolutely. A reminder of the complexities of moving away from COVID-0 as we see. The fatalities tear up and additional restrictions being put in place across some of those cities there. And also, of course, as we look ahead on the macro front when it comes to monetary policy to the Fed minutes later this week. Indeed, and the dollar is behaving classically and beautifully as risk off in markets, bit of paranoia, and so the dollar goes stronger. But does that sort of resplendence fade? But these equities are shaken this morning. They are indeed. Well, check across the Asian markets. Then the MSEI Asia Pacific. And of course, what is happening in China is playing into that, the pressure on Chinese stocks. After the strength that we saw yesterday or last week, actually, so the MSEI Asia Pacific, then that major index for the Asian markets currently down 8% of a percent over in Hong Kong losses of 1.5%. The Euro stocks futures then reflecting some of that pressure as well down 3% of a percent, the uncertainty over just how far China can go in easing the restrictions given that the COVID cases keep ticking up. S&P futures down 3% of a percent for the context. You did some modest gains last week for European equities losses though for US equities, but for the month on the run, you're looking at gains about 6% for US equities gains about 9% for European equities. But again, question marks about China, question marks about just how aggressively the Fed is going to be going. And again, the minutes later this week should give us a bit more detail in terms of the clarity in terms of the direction of travel for those Fed officials. Absolutely dynamic.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1426,2022-11-21 06:04:16
18813," is going to be going. And again, the minutes later this week should give us a bit more detail in terms of the clarity in terms of the direction of travel for those vet officials. Absolutely. And then we can debate all the peaks in the world. Bostic, of course, saying that we need to slow the feds pace. But one thing that is pervasive is that the dollar is rising this morning, as we see this risk of narrative in the markets. However, how long does that last for? Up a third of 1% on the dollar index, the fund managers that pile into their shorts on the dollar, the most since 2021, hedges are selling it for the fifth straight week. And I love what Anne's has said, exception is a dollar, exceptionalism premium is receding. Arnor dying at the moment in Dalyan, Singapore is more aggressively lower than that. As you see, a concern about the, as opposed to property pivot that infused the market last week, dissipate somewhat this morning, Brenton, a half of 1% were off the lows of the day, Goldman's cup, their view on Brent, now for the fourth quarter. Down by $10 to $100, they say demand will limp along into the fourth quarter. And two-year yields are falling ever so slightly as we, I suppose, debate where the peak is. I'll be Larry Summers later on today here in Dubai, debating that peak one to one on stage. Let's get to the rest of the markets. Annabelle's with us in the Hong Kong studio with the very latest on the markets, Annabelle. Thanks, Manus. Yeah, certainly you were just talking through some of the major themes they're watching here in Asia today as well, the Fed and then also what's happening in China. But just some other factors that play to cover as well as what we're seeing in Korea, given we didn't see exports there, really slumping in the month of November. So Korea is certainly a global well-weather. It really determines certainly the major trade forces globally for us. And that does really indicate to us the impact that rate rises are having on the global environment. Malaysia also very much in focus as well today are given that we were in a race to form a coalition there. We had an election in Malaysia at the weekend at Proof, and it resulted in the first ever hung parliament. So just in the last few minutes, the party PN has declared that it has a majority. But two parties now have to submit to the king who will be the next leader for the country. And then the deadline for that has now been extended for a further 24 hours until 2pm tomorrow. So that is just around 6am GMT. But let's change on. You mentioned that we do have this sell-off today in China. So that is certainly something we're watching as well, given that we did see the first COVID deaths at the weekend. And certainly is testing the resolve of officials there to start to pivot away from COVID-zero policies. Tom. And I will draw a list in Hong Kong. Thank you very much indeed with the tech there on the Asian markets and the back of the news out of China. Now to one of the big corporate stories, really, of the moment, Disney says former CEO Bob Iger will return to the position effective. Immediately, a company statement says Iger will take over from Bob Chappek and serve for two years. For more on this, let's talk to Alex Wei from Bloomberg, quick take. Alex, why has Disney bought Bob Iger back? Share price. The share price has not been doing brilliantly, basically. Look, Disney made a massive pivot over the past two years under pressure from activists and investors to make themselves more like Netflix and actually invest in streaming content, Disney Plus. And they did that. Netflix, then of course, has not had a brilliantly year. It's subscribed, but numbers have been stalling. It's share price and it's price earnings ratio has come down significantly. So Disney has fallen sort of not quite as much, but almost in lockstep with that. So this is never to fix them of that. And of course, he's famed for doing those monster deals with Pixar and Marvel, isn't he? Let's see what Bob Iger's magic can sprinkle across the kingdom. Put your other hat on, bit of crypto sir. We now know that the contagion is around three billion dollars in terms of unsecured creditors, but that's not the end of the story is in terms of the fallite for FTX. It's pervasive. Yes, there are lots of different stakeholders here. Of course, there are the bigger funds who have had holdings or had their investments with FTX. There are of course the investors in FTX. And then there's just you're running the mill punter who might have savings or just investments with you have their crypto investments in the FTX exchange. All of these are likely to be in fact.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1427,2022-11-21 06:08:43
18814," It's just you're running the mill punter who might have savings or just investments with you have their crypto investments In the FTX exchange all of these are likely to be affected Unfortunately, it looks as though that sort of retail investor if you want to call it that is like to be the last one on the food chain to get Get their piece of the pie so it's not looking good for all of these companies the fear is of course that if they have Huge losses at FTX that some of the big companies have to sell their holdings elsewhere Yeah, it's interesting that the liquidator has found pockets of liquidity and nearly 50 million dollars in cash Which caught my eye this morning Alex will see you through the day. That's quick takes Alex Web on the big tech stories of the day Now as we've been saying China has reported its first covert deaths since May and cases are spiking nationwide Hiding the concern that cities including the capital could return to a tougher set of regimes and restrictions Amoeu Brian is there for us on this story Emma the very latest I mean this is about concern About the velocity of the kind of contagion risk that we saw through Omicron just high fibrill is the situation in terms of lockdown to remaining open Yeah, I mean, I think you are at a make-up break point when it comes to China's Covert pivot they've pushed out this new set of parameters and now it's truly being tested by not only the uptick in cases But the onset of winter You are at this point in the COVID curve where you are going to start seeing deaths in addition to that first death in about six months That came out on Saturday. We've had a further two deaths in elderly people In Beijing over the weekend. So you are seeing the chickens coming home to risk somewhat when it comes to this wave And so we'll provide the ultimate test in many ways of the resolve of officials on whether they they are going to follow these rules Or whether they are going to sort of ease back into the restrictions that they know how to do and we are seeing some signs of that Shijiaatuan which is a city close to Beijing It was rumored a week ago that it was going to be a pilot testing site for full reopening of China Because they got rid of a whole lot of testing in line with these new parameters Well this morning they've basically gone back into COVID-0 They've advised people to stay at home a whole bunch of high-risk areas people are not allowed to leave their homes They're mass testing again something that was discouraged in these 20 new guidelines that were put out just a week ago So we are seeing a reversion to that playbook as cases do Tick higher so we're at a little bit of a knife said just to whether we see people Officials going back to that in orbit name Or whether they start to tolerate higher case levels and deaths Bloomberg's Emma O'Brien incidentally on the ultimate test then as she described it for officials in China as they face up to this surge in cases And which is of course butting heads with this 20 point plan to try and ease restrictions generally right the gochators that UN COP27 climate summit I've reached an historic last minute deal on payments for climate damages Let's get out to Bloomberg's Jennifer to besagged then who's in Sham Elshake Jen what has finally been agreed then? Yeah, Tom, I mean I'm a number of people are calling this historic especially when you think about the 30 years that it took to actually get loss and damage on the formal agenda at COP27 So it is significant because this fund is now a win for poor developing nations who have been calling For what some people call compensation climate reparations for the effects of climate change But a lot of the concerns are what happens next right because a lot of the text surrounding how is it financed how is it structured And our nations like China and other oil producing states donors or recipients that's still not being addressed But when it comes to to the deal itself We did see a number of nations agreed to reaffirm to keep temperatures below 1.5 Degrees Celsius, but really the biggest criticism out of this summit was was the cover decision And not strengthening some of the language that we saw from Glasgow at COP27",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1428,2022-11-21 06:12:53
18815," that degrees Celsius. But really the biggest criticism out of this summit was was the cover decision not strengthening some of the language that we saw from Glasgow at COP26. And namely, when it comes to emissions and emissions of reductions, a number of countries including India, the US, the EU wanted to see this text, wanted to see this text about phasing out all fossil fuels. But instead, it was a recycling of language that we saw last year of phasing down. And so now heading into COP28 in Dubai, which is, of course, a large oil and gas producer. A lot of people are concerned that although we did see the significant wind for developing nations, we still might not be on the path that we want to be ongoing forward, Manus. Dan, great work on the ground. There are visceral criticism from Alex Sharma's going that the clear follow through on the phased iron coal is not in this text. And that seems to be the disappointing point. Well done to you and Oliver. And the whole team on the ground. There are two weeks of just driving through our woman on the ground at COP27, Jen, Zabazaja in Sharma's shake. So we'll have a reset in terms of these markets coming up. Asset managers are turning ever more bearish on the dollar is its exceptionalism fading. The Fed. Are they really approaching peak in Hikes? We discuss with Vajra Stukambum from Northern Trust to Asset Management. Tom. Plus, kick off in Qatar. Yes, we're going to cover the weekends action at the World Cup. Disappointment for the host nation. We're bringing the details. This is Greenbite. What do you think of when you think of a battery? For most, it's what we use to power devices for both work and play, and maybe even your car. Over the past few decades, they've gotten way more powerful, long-lasting, and affordable. But all of this is just a prologue to what the next batteries are going to do. As we drive to an increasingly renewable power-driven grid, we also need to be able to store energy and release it later to cover those periods of weather intermittencies that are driving this new grid that we're in. It's a multi-trillion-dollar opportunity, and it's imperative that we figure out the solution here. How we store energy on a massive scale is, in many ways, the central challenge of the fight to stop climate change. You will shed light on dark matter. You will make aging optional. Because when you subscribe to Bloomberg, you won't just get news. You'll get insight into limitless possibilities. Before you change the world, Bloomberg. The market thinks the number is going to be about five. I look at things, and my sense is, there's more room for that to be too low. And there is for that to be too high. But it's pretty clear that we've had the big moves on this cycle. And now we're going to be finishing that process off. My view is that there's more risk from stopping prematurely. OK, former US Secretary of Secretary of State, of course, Larry.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1429,2022-11-21 06:17:06
18816," My view is that there's more risk from stopping prematurely. OK, former US Secretary of State of course, Larry Summers there talking, of course, to our colleagues on Blue Boat TV. Meanwhile, St Louis, Fred President James Bullard, has signal hikes will roll on while Atlanta, President Rafael Bostick says he favors slowing the pace of interest rate increases. During us now, is Valtors Sturkenborn, who is the chief investment strategist for Amir and APAC at Northern Trust, asset management valet? Thank you for joining us in the studio this morning then. Is the terminal rate more important for these markets, or is it a pair down? Is it the size of the rate hikes that markets are zeroed in on at the moment and looking through a potential terminal rate with a handle of above 5%. Well, actually, I think it's both. OK, if I look at the markets right now, they're clearly very worried that the Fed is going to push on beyond the terminal rate of 5% that the market is pricing in, worried that they won't be sensitive enough to the global growth slowed out, and of course, the fact that inflation has been rolling over quite significantly of late. And if the Fed doesn't account for that trend, then clearly markets have to discount a much higher terminal rate and a much higher discount rate on the back of that. And that's certainly something that we think we're seeing at the long end of the curve right now where rates are rolling over. Valtors, good morning. Good to have you with us. So the debate will be later on with Larry Summers whether we're going to enter a period. He's here in Dubai and we got a monopodium for a 1 to 1. It's whether we enter a phase of financial repression, which is what Rhoag Off and Reinhardt propagated in 2008, because the debt levels are so high. Do you see a period of financial repression? In other words, growth at around 8%, inflation, let's say at 5%, and rates at 4 and a half percent. In other words, grow your way and deflate out of the debt. Well, to some extent certainly we need a bit of financial repression, especially in those countries like think about Italy. Italy needs a nominal growth rate that's higher than its nominal interest rates to grow itself out of this debt situation. But if I look at sort of an anchor country like the USA, I think that case is much weaker. And I think there's still simply a debate going on in the US in terms of what terminal rate, what structural interest rate does this economy need to bring inflate inflation back down to that 2 to 3 percent range in a way that doesn't spike unemployment rates higher to a level that would be very painful for the US economy. And that's where, of course, where some are as a politician and as someone with a strong policy background is taking the cautious view, which makes perfect sense, because they have this asymmetric risk that he highlights, and they do want to be sort of very cognizant of the fact that they have to maintain credibility. But at the same time, we, yes, strategist and economists, we look ahead and we see growth slowing down. We see the disinflationary cycle coming on in the next six months. And we think that the Fed needs to be cautious not to overdo it out of respect for the labor market as well. Vanta, on the question of China, investors whiplashed just over the last few weeks. You see some positives, of course, in terms of the geopolitics, in terms of some easing of restrictions, at least in terms of the policy document they put out. And then, of course, you have what is happening just in the last 24 or 48 hours, which is a tick up in deaths and a tick up in case loads. And question marks about whether officials can, in fact, implement some of the easing on those restrictions. Are you seeing a case now for getting greater exposure to China? What is the timing around the reopening of China? Because clearly, there is going to be upside when that happens. You're absolutely right. And this is a very important question we're trying to answer. We are underway China. We're still on the cautious side of that debate. We have been highlighting the fact that monetary and fiscal policy has been easing. We've been looking at those property sector developments. But at the same time, we've been stepping back and saying, look, they haven't yet developed a domestic mRNA vaccine. They haven't yet rolled out a decisive health care policy that allows them to deal with COVID as it stands, which means that the zero COVID policy is still in effect, which means that risks are still tilted to the downside. So in that environment, where we saw the strong market reaction, we said, we're actually not participating in this, nor did we actually see international investors participate in it. So we're staying on the cautious side of it until we get much firmer confirmation that China has turned a corner on the zero COVID policies. And on the back of that, can turn a corner on its property sector developments as well. That sounds like a man that has no-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1430,2022-11-21 06:21:35
18817," has turned a corner on zero COVID policies and on the back of that can turn the corner on its property sector developments as well. That sounds like a man that has no that you have no fear of FOMO. So with no fear of FOMO in your highlight, if you're not going to have China in your in your bucket, where else in Asia do you want in your bucket? Well, we do like certain parts of Asia. We like the parts that are a little bit exposed to the what we call the regionalization trend that's happening in Asia where countries are taking some of their production capacity out of China and putting it in Philippines, putting it in Vietnam, putting it in Thailand. So there are parts of Asia that are looking structurally attractive, but for the region as a whole given how dependent it is on the China macro economic story, there's still a caution baked in there in our view. So there is for us, still simply a timeline that we have to monitor here. When is China going to turn the corner on COVID? When is it going to move forward on the property sector? We're simply not strong believers at this point that we're there yet. Pound, I want to get your views on credit before we let you go. It's almost a consensus trade, investment grade US credits seems to be something we hear from strategists and guests on almost a daily basis. You like high yield though. Are you getting the premium to reward you? Are you getting what's needed to reward you for taking on that extra risk? We think we are. If we look at the quality that's embedded right now in high yield, high yield average quality has actually moved up. So when we look at the spread relative to quality, we think there is still value there. And if we look at the tilt per leverage, we also still think there's value there. I do also want to highlight that for us, high yield is also a substitute for equity risk at this juncture. So we are taking it on as a low risk, risk asset, which is also, it's important to contextualize that in the in the broader asset mix. But still, we like high yield as it stands as well relative to IG. Okay, let's hope it's not too brutal to slow down. Vider, thank you very much. Vider is talking about that. Chief Investment Strategist for Emia and APAC over at Northern Trust asset management. Coming up in the show, it begins the world count that is kicked off at our bedroom yesterday. We discussed the action, the fireworks, the controversy. And oh yes, the football. A digital first approach to the future work is where the industry and all companies will be heading. The future work not be at home or in the office, but in the metaverse instead. There's that word, metaverse. Good. Well, how are you doing? When I think about the metaverse, I think about immersive experiences that have a sense of active presence. Wow, look at this. This is me. The metaverse is projected to become over a trillion dollar market by the end of this decade. And whether you know it or not, you'll probably be working there in the future. We're moving into a world where we're going to be interacting with computers with our bodies. This is definitely trippy. I think the adoption curve is going to be slow. It's weird. It's a real floaty thing right now. Oh, look at you. You have no legs. It's kind of a fun world and we're just at the very beginning of the very long journey. We're in the early stages of a sustainability revolution that has the magnitude of the digital revolution. And the digital revolution coupled with the speed of the digital revolution.

18818," MUSIC It's daybreak Europe with me, Manuscrenny and Dubai. Tom McKenzie alongside me at London HQ, it has begun. 2022 World Cup. It kicked off in Qatar. It was a lavish opening ceremony followed by the opening match between the hosts and Ecuador. The culmination of 12 years of a build-up marred by controversy over the initial bid. Human rights concerns, top the agenda and the run-up to the opening game. And the environmental impact, the moon, the Foxman has been covering it all and had a seat in the stands last night. She didn't send me the invitation, Tom. She just left me behind here in Dubai. So you got a ring-side seat. How cool was it? Oh, it was very cool. I mean, particularly the opening ceremony, there were light displays, there was dancing, there was music. And very exciting. And you certainly felt that in the stands. I think the excitement kind of tailored off a little bit after it was clear that Qatar was outmatched by Ecuador, ultimately losing to Nile. Also important, though, the geopolitical players in the stands. Sheikh Tamiñm, the emir of Qatar, sitting next to his father, who really wanted the World Cup, as well as Johnny Infantino, the FIFA president. But Infantino's left was Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. And I wonder if they were talking about the possibility of a Saudi World Cup that was key to me. Also, looking around the country, a little bit of a subdued atmosphere here, unclear whether that's because of the rescheduled match. Again, it was pushed a day earlier in order to garner the full global attention. So I'm going to be watching closely if we see a little bit more excitement on the ground. Oh, a Saudi World Cup. Can you imagine the controversy? That would attract this controversy about the controversy over Qatar. So how are the brands managing all of this? Yeah, this was a question I was really interested in, because we've seen brands really embrace social, impact ESG over the past couple of years. But I got in touch with 76 brands that either were team sponsors in North America, US, Canada, or Europe, or FIFA sponsors based in those same countries. And really, very few of them told me that they were changing their marketing plans in order to reflect the human rights criticism that Qatar has received. Now, this wasn't as much about Qatar and its human rights as situation as much as about how brands respond. There were 13 brands in Northern Europe, specifically Denmark, Van Netherlands, as well as Belgium, who did say they were changing their brand strategy, but only three of them had any even tenuous business ties to Qatar. OK, Simone Foxman, who has the arduous task of following the World Cup for us live from Doha Simone. Thank you. Thank you for the update. All right, coming up, Rishi Sunoz's government is forced to deny that the UK is seeking a closer relationship with the EU after a ports emerge, it's looking into a Swiss style deal with Brussels.

Yeah and there was that cautious optimism last week wasn't there that China would be back in terms of a global catalyst for growth of maybe offset some of those recession fears. And that is back in question as you say. And you are seeing that reflected across a benchmark over in Asia to drop a there of 9% of 8% on the MSCI Asia Pacific over in Hong Kong losses more pronounced down 1.8%. And the futures in Europe pointing to losses are 2% to 1% after a week where actually you did not shut just very modest gains on European stocks. So you saw stocks off for the week currently futures pointing lower by 3% to the context is you've seen a 6% rise in the month for US stocks. But again we look ahead to those FOMC minutes in terms of the guide. Given that flurry of commentary from Fed officials last week really pushing back on the idea of a pause. Right let's check in on the first word headlines now from around the world. A city near Beijing that was rumored to be a test case for removing virus restrictions across China has asked residents to stay at home for five days. And the potential sign officials are reverting to.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1433,2022-11-21 06:34:30
18820," To be a test case, full removing virus restrictions across China has asked residents to stay at home for five days. A potential sign officials are reverting to tighter COVID-0 curbs. Meanwhile, the country's first COVID-related death in almost six months has sparked concern that Beijing could see a return of restrictions. The report comes amid a continuing outbreak in the capital. Malaysian political leaders face a mid-afternoon deadline to inform the king of their choice of prime minister. That's after Saturday's vote produced the country's first ever hung parliament. Opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim says he has the numbers to form a government despite falling short of a simple majority. New court papers show Sam Bankman-Fried's bankrupt crypto empire owes its 50 biggest unsecured creditors a total of $3.1 billion. According to the redacted list, entities linked to FTX owe their single biggest creditor more than $220 million investors continue to pull funds from digital asset exchanges despite efforts to reassure markets about their stability. That is your first word news, Manus. Yeah, coming up more on COP27 over and they wrapped up the final communique from the conference. The winners, the losers and the opinions on success or failure. We'll wrap it up from Shama Sheikh. This is Bloomberg. There's more activity in the fusion world than ever and not just in government research labs. There's also an emerging private fusion industry that attracted billions of dollars in capital in recent years. Governments and private investors alike realize that we've got to find a solution that's going to allow us to get to net zero targets. This is one of the hardest but most rewarding problems that humanity could work on. Ultimately, we all want the same thing. We want someone to put electricity on their grid from a fusion power station as quickly as possible. Frankly, the scale of the challenge, 3000 gigawatts of fossil fuel to replace. There's not many things that can do that. In fact, there may only be fusion that can really do that. And while many in the scientific community predict fusion power will take decades, some in the private fusion space, believe we'll get there in just a few years as soon as the 2030s. In a multi-trillion dollar industry, there's a lot of ground to cover. Come on, these got absolutely crushed. We'll show you what's happening in ETFs like no one else. Bloomberg ETF IQ Monday on Bloomberg. Why do the biggest names in business choose Bloomberg? I have great questions. Great question. Great question. Best question I get all night.

And so, COP and is wound up, but the UK government is also in focus as they have denied that they're seeking a Swiss-style relationship with the European Union outcomes after the Sunday Times reported that British SNHF administration is exploring the options that would likely anger many within the party. Let's get to Lizzie Burden. She is live in Birmingham with a very special guest. Lizzie, good morning. Morning, Managed. Thank you very much. I'm at the confederation of British industry's annual conference. And I'm joined by the director general of the CBI Tony Dankeerts.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1434,2022-11-21 06:38:46
18821," Joining, Manus, thank you very much. I'm at the Confederation of British Indoor Industries, annual conference, and I'm joined by the Director General of the CBI, Tony Danker. Tony, thank you so much for joining me. Good morning. Thinking back to the fiscal statement from the Chancellor last week, how's he done enough to boost growth in the UK economy? No, not really. Let's be honest. I mean, look, this is probably a two-part play, right? Part one, the Autumn Statement last Thursday, was focused on calming the markets after a pretty difficult mini-budget, and also on combating inflation, which was the Prime Minister's state of aim. What it didn't do, as you alluded to, was really give any new momentum to Britain's growth story. And that's really important because, look, we've got a government now that's not spending money on growth. We've got a bank of England that's not trying to spend money on growth. So it's going to be even harder than ever to get growth going. But if we don't, then, yeah, the worry is, we're going to have another decade of flatlining productivity and low growth. And do you have the sense that Labour would have a more balanced focus on growth in inflation? Well, so far, the Labour Party have said I had an industrial strategy for investment in Britain, which is a good strategy, but it's very expensive. And I think the question that Keir Starmer will have to answer when he comes to CBI conferences, can they still really afford it? You know, we're in stagflation territory now, as Britain, that hasn't happened for decades. And so you can't really make a choice to tell you what, we'll fight inflation, not worry about growth. Or I'll tell you what, we'll go for growth and ignore inflation. You have to do both at the same time, so we're going to need some fresh thinking to do that. And were the measures that the Chancellor announced to close this gap in the Labour market sufficient? No, we didn't re-, we saw intent, but we didn't see any plans. And you're right to focus on the Labour market. You know, we've got hundreds of thousands of people not economically inactive after the pandemic. We've got an immigration system that's far too nervous about bringing in the skills we need. We haven't had a shortage occupation list for two years. And it is very important, because you know, when the Labour market is as it is, two things happen. One, inflation goes up because of wage pressure. And two, firms don't have the people to grow. So I think you're right to raise the importance of the Labour market. You mentioned immigration, and Manus mentions the reports over the weekend, denied by the government that it's looking at a Swiss style deal with the EU. Would closer ties with the EU help the Labour market problem? No, I don't think they will. Look, the truth is, and Simon Wolson of NEX said this, you know, Brexit meant we get to make our own choices on immigration, right? It doesn't mean we go back to an immigration system of the past. It means we choose to bring in the workers we need for the jobs we're missing. Now, in the long run, we want British people to fill the jobs we're missing. But until then, we're going to have to rely on immigration, on short-term visas. Otherwise, I'm afraid wage inflation will keep getting worse and worse, so therefore, will inflation, and we won't get growing. So it's a pretty serious issue for Britain now. So what style of Brexit does business want? Well, look, in the first instance, we just want the Boris Johnson Brexit deal to be implemented, and that's not happening right now because of the Northern Ireland protocol. It's a complicated situation, but if we don't get it solved, we're not going to have that science partnership with Europe. We're not going to have the recognition of professional qualifications for British professionals. So there's so much more economic growth could be within Boris Johnson's own Brexit deal. So forget about the Swiss thing. You know, let's implement the Boris deal because at the moment it's not happening. And what do you remember think about investment zones being announced and then two months later, completely scrapped? Is something completely different? Yeah, look, I think it's fair to say that in the last six months, businesses have been pulling their hair out at how everything is changing. But one thing Jeremy Hunt did say last Thursday, which I think is pretty interesting. He wants to get behind this idea of business clusters. That's the idea that across the UK, there's some real specialism and strengths, whether or not it's in the northeast of England, hydrogen and carbon capture, in the southwest of England, it might be cybersecurity. If we can have a system that the Chancellor's backing that really grows these UK-wide success stories, that would do a lot to get the economy growing. And what could really convince business to start investing in the UK again? Well, we have the Prime Minister here this morning. I'm hoping we'll hear something from him, not again about stability. We heard that on Thursday, but about growth, about what he and government can do to drive momentum.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1435,2022-11-21 06:43:16
18822," I'm hoping we'll hear something from him not again about stability. We heard that on Thursday, but about growth, about what he and government can do to drive momentum. You're right because, actually, right now a lot of firms out there are making their budget decisions for 2023. The ones I speak to say, we'll look on the one hand, I think we're going to grow. On the other hand, everyone's telling me there's going to be a very deep recession. I think we do need to give signals about confidence to invest. We do need the Prime Minister to say government will back you if you invest. We probably need people like me and the thousand businesses here to come away with the message. Let's go for growth. Tony Danker, CBI Director-General, thank you so much for joining me here in Birmingham at your annual conference. Tony's going to be making a speech later. We're expecting him to focus on growth and we'll also be hearing from the Prime Minister Rishi Sunak who are expecting to focus on innovation back to you, Manus Tom. An important place to gator sentiment of British business, but particularly important on the back of that autumn statement. Lizzie Burnham with some important interviews from the CBI in Birmingham. Thank you very much indeed. Now, from Birmingham, let's head to Egypt then, negotiators at the United Nations COP27 climate summit. Well, they've reached an historic last minute deal, finally, on payments for climate damages. I'm Sue Bloomberg, Jennifer Sapsarger, then who's been across all of this for us in Shamal Shake. Jen, tell us about the details of this deal, how it's going to work in terms of the funding and the commitments. Yeah, Tom, I mean, I think the biggest thing with this deal was that it got on to the formal agenda, but really when you think about the details behind the deal, the hard work might start for a lot of negotiators at this point in time because yes, a fund was agreed upon, but the terms of the fund are still unknown. And so we don't know who is going to be a part of this fund, who are going to be the nations that are actually going to be benefiting from this compensation, and also who are going to be those that are contributing to this fund. So a lot of the tension last week that we saw was what should be considered, who should be considered developing or developed nations. And right now, the UN is basing it on the 1992 framework, but if you look at that framework, it includes countries like China, Saudi Arabia, and a number of other countries that, of course, as we know today are some of the biggest emitters, and that is going to be key for negotiators to hammer out moving forward. So when it comes to this fund specifically, we heard from Sami Shukre, who is the COP27 president, say that there's going to be a committee that is set up to hammer out some of these details, and it will include two chairs, one from a developed nation and one from a developing nation, to start to hammer out some of these details, what this new funding will look like, and also what if anything more is agreed upon at COP28 next year, how that will actually be implemented. And so we know that this committee is starting to meet for the first time in March of 2023. So it is significant that the steel was reached, but now the hard work begins. But there is also disappointment, I mean, it depends on which minister you talk to. If you look at the previous COP Chair, Alex Sharma, I mean, he's visceral in terms of, and this was the debate, India, on coal and a number of other nations, it's clear that the follow-through on the phase down of coal, it's just not in this text. So is that just bashing the agreement, or is that a deep disappointment in terms of coal, and in terms of a commitment to phase out fossil fuels? Not phase down, but phase out. And that, Manus, was the tension that you could see last week. I mean, and the language is so key for a lot of ministers when you think about this. And the fact that it wasn't included in this final decision really upset a number of people. You mentioned the COP26 president. We also heard from Franz Timmerman, who said he didn't feel like this was actually taking us a step forward in the direction that we want to be in. And a lot of the criticism, depending on who you were speaking to last week, was the fact that it was reported that a number of fossil fuel lobbyists were actually around at this summit, making their own case for not phasing out all fossil fuels, but just some. So there's a lot of.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1436,2022-11-21 06:47:35
18823," around at this summit, making their own case for not phasing out all fossil fuels, but just some. And so there's a lot of disappointment in not taking this another step further from Glasgow, because yes, there is a loss and damage fund that is significant. But if we're not getting anywhere closer to keeping global warming below the 1.5 degrees, if major emitters are still able to do so, then are we really taking this a step forward? And so, like you mentioned, man, that really depends on which minister you speak with. Jen, before the 27 summit started, and show my show, you did have the warning from the United Nations. And in fact, meeting this 1.5 degree commitment was almost dead in the water, essentially. And that was going to have significant consequences across this climate. What has been agreed to try and close the gap on that? What are the details that have been confirmed during this meeting? In terms of the climate action? Right. I mean, the one most significant part that a lot of negotiators and a lot of the climate activists here who we have spoken to was the fact that a lot of countries signed up to this global methane pledge, excuse me, which is significant because if we have 150 nations signing up to this, that is taking us a step in the right direction. There's also this idea that the US and China are now working together again. We heard from John Kerry on Sunday talking about how significant and how crucial it is for the US and China, of course, two major emitters to be working together and in dialogue about how to bring down a mission. So those were some of the two biggest takeaways from this summit. But of course, there's still a lot more work to be done, Tom. There is indeed the baton passes here to the UAE. And let's see what they deliver going into next year. Now you can maybe do a little bit of scuba diving you and the team, you and all of her crew. Well done, on the ground. Staying there to the bitter end are very own Jennifer Zabazazia on the ground in Shamel Shake. Coming up after a fairy tale farewell two years ago. Long time, Disney CEO, Bob Iger returns to sprinkle his magic across the kingdom with the details on Blimpogue. What do you think of when you think of a battery? The most is what we use to power devices for both work and play and maybe even your car. Over the past few decades, they've gotten way more powerful, long-lasting and affordable. But all of this is just a prologue to what the next batteries are going to do. As we drive to an increasingly renewable power driven grid, we also need to be able to store energy and release it later to cover those periods of weather intermittencies that are driving this new grid that we're in. It's a multi-trillion dollar opportunity, and it's imperative that we figure out the solution here. How we store energy on a massive scale is in many ways the central challenge of the fight to stop climate change.

18824," The music plays on the SO season sponsor Bank of America. Welcome back to Brunbo, David. I'm Tom McKenzie in London with Manus Pranay in Dubai. Now Disney says former CEO Bob Iga will return to the position of the current effective immediately. Iga stepped down in 2020 after leading the company through a period of enormous growth over 15 years. For more on this, let's talk to Alex Wefton-Bruber, Quick Take Joneses in the studio. Alex, I remember speaking to Bob Iga in Shanghai when they opened Shanghai Disney. And the question always was, once you got paused, the question was about the result and what they were trying to do in that particular country. What is happening? How long are you sticking around for? He's leading. He's leading. They couldn't find someone to replace him. Then Bob Chappecket to go over it. Now what's happened? Bob was not in place. Chappeck for very long. Pandemic hit, of course. Bob Iga back. It's a remarkable turnaround. Actually, part of the issue might well have been that a lot of the big strategic decisions were taken by Bob Iga and then handed it over to Bob Chappeck to execute. Now, what Disney had really been doing was under pressure from activists and investors trying to become more like Netflix, doubling down on streaming. Now, of course, we've seen over the past few months. Netflix has not had a brilliant time of it. So therefore, there's a corollary. There's a knock on effect to Disney. The investors have started asking, was this the right choice? Now, Disney shares are not down as much as Netflix. Of course, Disney has a huge, for instance, theme parts business as things have opened up. That has improved. But the share price has been down and you've tied that with the internal morale. That Bob Chappeck has been making decisions that have not affected the internal morale positively. And that is a fact here as well. Alex, let's just talk a little bit about Twitter. I mean, more reports than Elon Musk is considering more layoffs. I'm sitting with him. I Trump tweaked open in front of me because there's been a poll over the weekend about letting Donald Trump return to Twitter. I don't know which is the bigger piece of news, but I suppose making sure Twitter operates is the starting point. Elon Musk has obviously been cutting quite a lot of jobs already. He then issued this automated last week to employees or just the week before they had to complete it by last week, saying whether they're willing to be part of this new hardcore Twitter, far more employees left than he had anticipated, but crucially, those employees were largely in engineering. He wants now the reporting suggests to cut jobs in sales. And that is now coming into his sites. Now, on the Trump side of things, Trump is playing a little bit coy. There's no guarantee that he is going to come back to Twitter. I suspect that as we get closer to the election, to the 2024 election, he will get back on the platform. He has, of course, got his own inadvertent comments competitor. It's not very big, truth social, largely aimed at his supporters. And so for now, he says he's going to stick to that. And this is just how nimble Alex Webb is because we're now switched to crypto, FTX and its creditors. This is just a new line in this saga. What do we know at this point? So we know that they've got three-point, the creditors of 3.1 billion of holdings in theory in FTX. They are really the third party we're hearing about right now because these are the big institutional, the insent of crypto institutions that have holdings in the company. Then, of course, you've got the actual investors in FTX who are looking as though they're probably going to lose all of their capital. And thirdly, you've got the retail investors, the smaller players who have investments. And for some savings in FTX, they look as though they're probably going to be, unfortunately, they're coming after the big institutions in terms of getting any capital back. So it's not looking rosy for a lot of those players. When it comes to that 3.1 billion, the risks of contagion in crypto are broadly a considerable because if they need to find other ways of covering those losses, then maybe they'll have to sell down, for example, Bitcoin holdings elsewhere. Okay, Alex, thank you very much. Yeah, the contagion is far from done. And yet the liquidator has found pockets of healthy balance sheets and nearly $15 million in cash. It was quite surprised to see that out. From the Bloomberg Quicktake team. Redhead line from China last week was a 16-point plan to, as opposed to reinvigorate the housing market.

18825," take team. Red headline from China last week was a 16 point plan to, as opposed to reinvigorate the housing market. We now have the PBOC saying that they are going to talk to bank regulators, Tom, urging stabilization in property financing. Now it's yet to really materially impact on the markets, per se. We'll keep an eye on the on the billing sector. But the PBOC, the bank regulator will hold a seminar today on bank loans. So this is one of the big levers, Tom. Isn't it in China in terms of stability to the economy and, indeed, reassuring the world that they are on some kind of a regrowth trajectory? I mean, this is a sector managed that accounts for to your point about 20% on some calculations of China's GDP to the importance. And this is another measure that's just building on these measures that have been pushed through by officials to try and ease the burden on this property to say so. As you say, across the benchmark, CSI 300 is still down by 8 cents of 8%. But this is an unfolding story, we continue to watch it for you. As again, they try to put a flaw under what has been, of course, a collapsing real estate market in China. Right, up next to Bloomberg markets, Europe, of course, we're going to bring you more market analysis as we look ahead, of course, to getting further clarity on the direction of travel from the Federal Reserve. And we continue across the China story when it comes to COVID, Manus, as well, with the number of cases surging. And to your point about the property plan, the plan for COVID, as well, being challenged in China, Manus. Yeah, and that's what we see here, which is on the global market map. You are seeing risk off across the markets this morning on those rising cases within Beijing and within China. What are the next steps in terms of taming the resurgence of COVID? That has caused the dollar to rally and the remember to roll down. As you can see, down by some six tenths of 1% iron ore and copper, the fundamental building blocks of a reopening narrative in China, also under pressure this morning, copper down by 1.3%, iron ore down by 2.67%. And of course, they had rallied quite considerably on the back of that 16 point plan last week. We'll leave it to Anna and Mark in Singapore and London to take you through Bloomberg markets, Europe, the first reaction to the breaking news that the PBOC, the bank regulator urging stabilization in property finance. AIs is the chance of humankind to really understand itself. How much of that is true? How confident? Did you actually over achieve? Did you, you know, back then realize that we would be using AI in many different jobs? Was it slower or faster than you thought at the time? I think if I had a 35 or 40 here prediction task, I would have been more or less on track as to where we are today. But I would have predicted steady linear increase over time. But instead, the field had very minimal improvements until the last five or ten years. Then it really took off. I think we ended up in the right place, but I was very wrong about the trajectory. To this date, we still know very little about how the brain works, but these machines are getting ever more powerful. And I feel in some sense, we did end up learning how.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1439,2022-11-21 07:00:36

If we exclude all the things machines can do better than us as what makes us unique in our human intelligence, then now we can rule out many, many things because AI or machine learning has become so good at so many things that what's left must be the key aspects of human intelligence. Good morning. Welcome to Bloomberg Market's Europe. I'm Anna Edwards live in London. The cash trade is just less than an hour away here on your top headlines. Covid-0 concerns reemerging China driving Asian equities lower as Beijing tightens curves amid a resurgence of the virus, including the first fatalities since May. Seeking the old magic, Bob Iger returns to Disney as CEO, hoping to stem the shares' worst performance since at least the 1970s. One historic agreement negotiators at COP27 reach an 11-hour deal for a fund that compensates developing nations for climate devastation, but falls short on fossil fuels, we'll get a live update from Shamel Shake. Welcome to the programme already. It's Monday morning. Just under an hour away from the start of cash equity trading here in Europe. So let's get straight to the future's picture and see how we are positioned. A bit of negativity creeping into futures, not by much on FTSE futures, a little more elsewhere. The session on Friday saw European markets making some gains, but the US session was yes positive, but flat in some cases and now that was fairly flat. So we pair expectations here in Europe a little bit, add into that the news flow surrounding China, of course, and things look a little bit negative as we stand right now. The future's picture for the US looks a little bit weaker as well. We're down by four tenths of 1% on E-minis. Now features now three tenths, now stack futures, down four tenths of a percent. So a bit of weakness, setting in, risk of aversion, setting in, and that is clearly visible on the GMM. If we have a look at the GMM, you'll see Asian equities under pressure and particular Chinese stocks, MSCI Asia Pacific as a sort of measure of the whole region, down by just over 1%. And this has a lot to do with China. You can see that everything in the FX column is red, apart from the dollar, the dollar is catching a bid today that move into the perceived safety of the US greenback. Has, of course, to the detriment of the detriment of the Chinese, where MIMB, the Euro, the pound, all of those on the back foot as you see there in the second column under 4X. He's also weaker and this once again to do with the China story, expectations that perhaps getting back to growth in China or getting back to growth that we'd recognize in China is going to take a little bit longer. Let's get to some breaking news before we return to the China story. Let's just get to a bit of breaking news on the German data front. And we have German PPI coming in, 34.5%, which by historic standards is an enormous number. So this is by no means the end of worries about the price factory gates in Germany. So this is the price that businesses pay essentially for their supplies, 34.5%, but it is lower than have been anticipated and much lower than the prior reading. So this has fallen a whole 10% for 45.8%, or 10% whose points I should say from 45.8%. And it is weaker, that it is sorry, lower than the survey number, which was 42%. If you're looking for signs that the inflation story in Europe is moving in the right direction, then perhaps we have at least one month of data that would suggest that is the case. Let's return to the China story. These are the futures then for Europe, as you can see, in response to that Chinese number, not particularly move, sorry, to that German number, not particularly moving. Let's get to the China story. China has reported its first COVID death since the month of May, as cases spike nationwide, heightening concern, cities, including the capital, could see a return to tougher restrictions. Let's speak now to Blinkbanks, Emma O'Brien.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1440,2022-11-21 07:04:50
18827," about seasonality. Either the market realizes that this easing of COVID policy will come in the spring. And it wants to look through all of this. Having a full reopening in the midst of a winter, when case usually grow, was unrealistic from the very beginning. So the markets need to get a grip around this, decides to look through to the spring or really take a negative view like it is this morning. OK, so where does this leave risk appetite, do you think, Geraldine? Is this what we're seeing a little bit of a pullback, just a small setback in a broad re-rating and return to appetite for risk in China? Is today more significant? I would say it's probably what you said first is that ultimately, if the rest of the world is looking like we are getting disinflation, central banks are going to give it the market might be able to look through. If the negative news come more, like maybe we're looking for a higher peak in interest rates from the Fed or such things, then it will be a lot more complicated. OK, so the Fed, and of course still in the driving seat, more on that in just a moment. Let me ask you about the sort of further fall out from what we expect from China. I noticed that Goldman Sachs have cut their oil outlook by $10 and part of that is to do with China, it's to do with lockdown spreading. I wonder if we can be in a situation where commodities respond with downside moves on expectations that China won't deliver and yet equities count on the positives. How do you view those two dynamics, Geraldine? It is very true that when we look at our model and what different markets are saying, they're not all saying the same thing. And in particular, the equity market, we think a sign of very low probability to recession. Whereas other markets like credit, for instance, have a much higher probability. So there is somehow of each of their own at the moment. And we think that the market needs to reconcile all of this. And it would seem that the fixed income market is much more ahead in terms of this global slowdown. The fact that China is not going to reopen before the spring, and that might actually coincide with a global recession. So the impact overall on commodities should be a lot more than equity seems to be in the world of their own at the moment when we look at valuation and the very strong bounce that we've seen of it. Yes, and you're slightly dubious of some of those valuations, I think, Geraldine. And as a result, don't have quite such appetite for equities. But you see the near and long term case for fixed income as being pretty strong. It gives us the reasons for that. When we think that we're coming into the zone where the market is trying to find tune, where is the peak of interest rates of various central banks? But it's getting mostly priced in the market. But looking a little bit further, we think that inflation is going to come down throughout 2023, the fact that commodity prices are going down, the fact that freight rates, the fact that goods prices are going down is all very encouraging signs. And there are four, with relatively high yield at the moment that we bring income, we think that fixed income is looking relatively attractive. And if you think like our forecast, that the recession is fairly likely looking at 2023 pretty much in every developed market economy, then we would think that the old correlation that we're used to really assert themselves, that therefore, having fixed income in portfolio, starting to make a lot of sense. So that's the case for fixed income. Going back to where we started the conversation, finally, Geraldine then. So taking on board what you said there about how commodity prices have been coming down. If we did see a strong rebound in China's economy, and then commodity prices went higher in conjunction with that, would that actually strangely act as a threat then to the global economy? Well, it could put us train on various commodity prices and maybe we get another wave of inflation. If it hadn't been in the surprises on the way, we've had the Delta wave, we've had the conflict, and if you train, maybe we get another wave that's sort of derails.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1441,2022-11-21 07:12:02
18828," Any surprises on the way? We've had the Delta wave, we've had the conflict in Ukraine. Maybe we get another wave that sort of derails and push yet again, and slightly upward, the peak of interest rates. And that's why at the moment, we are repositioning portfolio to start to increase a little bit, positioning in terms of fixed income. But it's not yet pound the table call. And we remain cautious on this. And certainly give some powder dry to be able to continue adding into the year and into some low liquidity dislocation or into the first part of the year in 2023. Geraldine, thanks very much. Stay with us. Geraldine Sunsir and Pincoportfolio Manager for Acid Allocation Strategy. She will be with us a little bit longer on the program, more from her shortly. Coming up on the program, we will also get you up to date with what's been going on on the environment. COP27 ends with then historic agreements. We'll be out in Charmell's shake for details. Plus, one global event ends and another begins, of course. We'll get the view from Doha on the controversial World Cup. He has at least started. We'll get all of the latest from Doha. We're back with Pincoport. Geraldine Sunsir and shortly, with more on the global outlook, the global outlook for the bond market and for global growth. If you have any questions you want us to put to our guests, please do send them in. IB plus TV Go. That is the function to use still dark here, very early in London. This is Blinkback. A digital first approach to the future work is where the industry and all companies will be heading. The future work not be at home or in the office, but in the metaverse instead? There's that word, metaverse. Good. Well, how are you doing? When I think about the metaverse, I think about immersive experiences that have a sense of actor presence. Wow, look at this. This is me. The metaverse is projected to become over a trillion dollar market by the end of this decade. And whether you know it or not, you'll probably be working there in the future. We're moving into a world where we're going to be interacting with computers with our bodies. This is definitely trippy. I think the adoption curve is going to be slow. It's weird. A real floaty thing right now. Oh, look at you. You have no legs. It's kind of a fun world. And we're just at the very beginning of a very long journey. We're in the early stages of a sustainability revolution that has the magnitude of the industrial revolution coupled with the speed of the digital revolution. Nobody covers climate change like Bloomberg, your global business authority. The world is going to lose 1.5% of GDP just because of divisions that may split us into two trading blocks. This is $1.4 trillion. For Asia, the loss is much more significant because Asia is so integrated in global value chains. It could be 3% or more. As Chris Vina Goghi gave for the IMF managing director, speaking to Bloomberg Steven Engel in Bangkok on Saturday, she was talking there about global growth, the risk to global growth, the risks to global trade and where they fall in particular in that Asia conversation. Let's talk about the global growth story. Geraldine Sunstrom still with us and the PIMCO portfolio manager for asset allocation strategies is still with us. Geraldine, you think then if we do enter into a period where we're preoccupied instead of inflation,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1442,2022-11-21 07:16:17
18829," with us, Pemko portfolio manager for asset allocation strategies is still with us. And Geraldine, you think then if we do enter into a period where we're preoccupied instead of inflation but by recession fears that bond markets do well, is that just treasuries which are the bond markets you favor? Going into a recession you should opt for quality. So of course, government bonds and in particular, those of countries that have very interest rate sensitive economies, I'm thinking about Australia or Canada for instance and a little bit behind the US. But we also like high quality triple A, securities bond or agency mortgages in the US, certain investment grade corporate bonds really staying in the high quality. It's too early to venture into lower quality assets like high yield or equities when the recession is just about to start. And we don't really know yet the full control of it if it's going to be only mild which would be our forecast or might be more severe and put certain weaker companies and credit address. Where does that quality razor leave Giltz, Geraldine? I was reading over the weekend about how by a lot of people's analysis, Gilt markets could be threatened in particular next year where we look to perhaps see all time highs in terms of guilt supply. In terms of the UK and Giltz were fairly neutral on this market, we feel that of course Giltz are quite higher than in Europe. The situation is complex. It's a very, it's a smaller open economy will be very sensitive to the level of currencies and inflation is going to, it has risen pretty high. It's probably has more in the pipe with the price of energy looking ahead. So this is something where we're not really risking anything neutral because yields are looking more attractive than in continental Europe but wouldn't go overweight because the risks are also less controllable. The risks are less controllable. We've seen of course Gilt markets very focused on fiscal policy setting. We saw the pound was focused on that. More broadly the effects narrative though is very much has been around strong dollar and given today's risk aversion we returned to a strong dollar Geraldine in today's session up half a percent on the DXY and the Bloomberg dollar index. Do you think we topped out on the dollar? We think the dollar is expensive. There's no question about that and whichever way we try to cut it it does look expensive. That said we are still in this period of uncertainty. Markets are still trying to find the speak of interest trade this you know inflection point in inflation and central bank policy. And in this period of uncertainty the dollar will have a tendency to remain expensive. So it means that we remain underweight European currencies which are very sensitive to the situation in Russia. However we're still willing to start dipping a toe in those currencies in emerging market that have extremely high level of yield more often than not in double digit territory. This is a shy call we think that those economies started much earlier the process of hiking interest rates tend to have you know current account balances or terms of trade that are much more positive than those of Europe for instance and they were willing to go and try to fetch a little bit of carry. So for now we tend to say like you know don't bet the wrench on being short the dollar and be cautious but certainly an expensive currency. Yes an expensive currency and one that the dollar expensive and so from that you suggest that maybe the emerging market dollar story is different from the European dollar story and thinking about whether euro heads I started this program this hour Geraldine talking about the PPI story out of Germany and yes PPI looks really still very elevated in the 30% range but much but weaker than it was a month ago but that has very little impact on the euro this morning I mean it is only Germany but but you would think that that would be an important indicator I suppose it's the it's the Chinese growth story that is that is weighing more heavily because the euro continues to be down by around 6% this morning. Yeah I think when I look at the PPI what comes to mind is corporate profit margins and this is much more of a risk to the European stock market than anything else the fact that we might not have seen in the second and third quarter earnings.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1443,2022-11-21 07:20:38
18830," that we might not have seen in the second and third quarter earnings what's really going to happen and we're going to see this in the fourth quarter earning more likely and the market has been very sang with around Europe and that's what might be where in fact is the mistake. The foreign exchange market probably has been much quicker into taking into account the flows and the fact that Europe is turning to a trade deficit zone. Geraldine thanks so much for your time really gets to get your insights. Geraldine Sunström, PIMCO, Portfolio Manager for asset allocation strategies. Thank you very much for joining us. Let us get a broader update on some of the global news flow. A Bloomberg first web news update here's Alice Atkins. Good morning, Alice. Morning Anna, the COP talks in Egypt have ended with an agreement to help developing nations face the devastation of climate change. Although the deal for a loss and damage fund paid for by rich countries is seen as a breakthrough. Negotiators fail to agree further cuts in CO2 emissions. Malaysia's political leaders now have until 2pm Tuesday local time to decide on a prime minister. The King has extended the deadline by 24 hours after Saturday's vote resulted in the country's first ever hand parliament. Opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim says he has the numbers to form a government despite falling short of a simple majority. The UN's atomic agency says powerful blasts have shaken the area around Ukraine's Leporizia nuclear power plant. The IAEA says some buildings and systems were damaged but none critically. Ukraine's nuclear regulators says Russian forces struck the facility. Moscow blames Ukraine for the shelling. The UK government says it isn't seeking a new Swiss style relationship with the EU. The pushback comes after a Sunday Times report that Prime Minister Rishu Sonek's administration is exploring closer economic ties with its European neighbours. Switzerland is a member of the European Free Trade Association and participates in the single market for most goods. Global news 20,000 a day on air and on Bloomberg quick take card by more than 2700 journalists and analysts in more than 120 countries. This is Bloomberg Anna. Alice, thanks very much. Thanks for the update Alice Akins here in London. The headline across my Bloomberg's similar around Qatar is around energy. China's cynopech and Qatar energy sign long-term LNG supply deal which we're interesting for European nations finding it difficult to get their hands on enough gas over the winds of a half. But coming up we will get you up today with the World Cup and how that is playing out. The World Cup finally kicking off yesterday in Qatar after 12 years of hard work preparation and just a little bit of controversy. We will go live to Doha to get the wrap of last night's action. This is Bloomberg. There is an epic saying in Italy when it comes to family generations that the first generation creates the second generation expands and the third generation destroys and that's almost what happened in the Gucci story. So, Hating and Love again. Now I would have had a much more experience about Doha who says I love you and then they'll trade you. The Gucci family was the strength but also the weakness of the label. The situation became dire with Gucci's finances. They were not able to pay salaries.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1444,2022-11-21 07:25:05
18831," of their label. The situation became dire with Gucci's finances. They were not able to pay salaries. They were not able to pay suppliers. Gucci's really teetering on the brink of the stage. We still have 35 minutes to go until the start of cash. We will see in China as cases of Covid tick up and even deaths. We will focus on that. That is what is going on. The Asian session is down by 1% on MSCI. Let's return to something we talked about last week. The World Cup will be very front and center for many watching the markets and distracted by this. The World Cup, 2022 World Cup is kicked off in the Qatar. A lavish opening ceremony was followed by the opening match between the hosts and Ecuador. It is the culmination of a 12 year build-up that has been marred by controversy over the initial beard human rights concerns and the environmental impact. Let's get to move on to Simon Foxman who has been watching from the stands. Simon, a privileged position to be in no doubt. You can see the opening ceremony online. The BBC decided not to show much of the opening ceremony on its main broadcasting channels. What are we watching for today? Yes, Qatar is not coming out ahead in that match. It was exciting in the stands. However, we haven't seen that same excitement reflected on the streets. We were walking around to some of the fan zones, the fan areas yesterday. They were pretty empty, frankly. Part of this may be that first match was rescheduled to a day earlier late in the game after a lot of people had already booked their travel plans. We want to see for this to be a success. We want to see some excitement in the streets and fans enjoying themselves. The other thing we are going to be watching for particularly is the England Iran game. That will kick off at 4pm local time. There are protests in Iran. We are very closely watching to see how the Iranian team, whether or not they make any gestures and support of those protests. Also, Harry Kane has wanted to wear a one love arm band in support of LGBTQ rights. May not be able to though. Okay, so certainly all known off the pitch. A lot to watch today. I mentioned a headline a moment ago about Qatar signing a deal with China. I see Qatar to supply sign-up with 4 million tonnes of LNG a year for 27 years. I suppose given the spotlight on Qatar, we ask how significant this could be. This is the very first supply agreement for Qatar's Northfield expansion project to dramatically expand the amount of LNG can produce by about 60%. But note that the deal be signed with China and not with the European buyer, Anna. Yeah, absolutely something that no doubt will not be lost on Brussels. So, mate, thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1445,2022-11-21 07:29:21
18832, My grandfather got into the mutual fund business because the average investor could not get a diversified stock portfolio and it was too dangerous to put you know your entire savings in it just a couple of companies. So the mutual fund was created to give a diversified expert management at a reasonable price. Today we have a phenomenon where companies are waiting much longer to go public and so in 2000 the average company went public after three years. Now companies are waiting nine to ten years because there's so much money available in the private markets. As a matter of fact there are half the number of public companies that there were in 2000 and there's five times the number of private equity back companies. So just from an investible universe you look at the private markets and it's you know significantly bigger. So the question is that return that used to be captured in the public markets is now captured in the private markets. But the problem is you know is you're really tied up for a long time when you invest in a private equity fund. And so trying to figure out a way to solve the same problem my grandfather was trying to solve which is how do you bring those returns responsibly the democratization of the private markets to the retail investors and I describe it as a bit of like running the scissors. This is a great tool if you use it appropriately. And so we're focused on trying to figure out responsibly bringing it in to the average investor. A multi trillion dollar industry there's a lot of ground to cover. Come on and he's got absolutely crushed. And show you what's happening in ETFs like no one else Bloomberg ETF IQ Monday on Bloomberg. This is Bloomberg daybreak with link. Welcome to daybreak Australia. It's time under the close welcome to Bloomberg crypto. Welcome back to Bloomberg markets here at 30 minutes to go until the start of cash equity trading for another week here are your top stories. COVID zero concerns reemerge in China driving Asian equities lower as Beijing tightens curbs amid a resurgence of the virus including the first fatalities since May. Seeking the old magic Bob Iger returns as a Disney CEO hoping to stem the shares worst performance since at least the 1970s. And historic agreement negotiators at COP27 reach an 11th hour deal for a fund that compensates developing nations for climate devastation but falls short on fossil fuels. We are live in Shamel Shake for an update. Welcome back to the program everybody let's have a quick look at the future speech and it looks negative but we're down by around 2 3 tens of a percent on European stocks. We had seen some positivity yesterday that was on the way in in the last part of the US session. So perhaps we play catch up there also weighing on sentiment is what's going on in China and the COVID fight there. The rising case rate sadly deaths from COVID of course in China as things open up a little. But also the policy response and the response function. We're seeing signs of the old playbook the COVID zero playbook according to our colleagues who are covering this story which is interesting if you're thinking about growth expectations. Interesting lines coming through from the PBOC comforting that monetary support remains robust in the Chinese economy. Those lines coming through from Ye Gang at the PBOC. Let us get a blue-and-bag business slash top corporate stories we're covering this morning. Here's Alice Ackins. Hi Anna new court papers show Sam Bankman freeze bank corrupt crypto empire owes its 50 biggest unsecured creditors a total of 3.1 billion dollars. According to the redacted list entities linked to FTX owe their single biggest creditor more than 220 million dollars. Investors continue to pull funds from digital asset exchanges despite efforts to reassure markets about their stability. Walt Disney is bringing back former CEO Bob Aiger to run the company. The 71 year old spent more than 4 decades at Disney including 15 years as chief executive. The company says he's agreed to serve for two years succeeding Bob Chaperk who is leaving immediately.

18833," leaving immediately. Disney shares are heading towards their worst annual loss since at least the 1970s. The IMF says the rise of trade barriers against China and other countries over the past year could cost the global economy $1.4 trillion. Fund manager director Kristalina Jordie Eiliver says the potential loss for Asia could be more than 3% of GDP, because the region is more integrated into the global value chain. The world is going to lose 1.5% of GDP just because of divisions that may split us into two trading blocks. This is $1.4 trillion. For Asia, the loss is much more significant because Asia is so integrated in global value chains. It could be 3% or more. That's your Blinberg business flash, Anna. Thanks very much. Thanks, Alice Atkins here in London now. Let's get to UK politics. The UK government has denied it is seeking a Swiss style relationship with the European Union. That denial comes after the Sunday Times reported, which is soon-academy is exploring the option that would likely anger many in his party who were more in favour of a hard Brexit. Let's get to Blinberg's Lizzie Burton, who joins us now from the CBI conference in Birmingham. Lizzie, very good to have you with us, because I imagine the CBI conversation could be sidetracked by this reporting by the Sunday Times about the possibilities of changing the relationship with the EU, but also very much taking place in the aftermath of the last week's budget. Yes, very much hot in the room, this conversation about Brexit, the B word back on the table, Anna. And really, the idea of a Swiss style relationship with the EU is anathema to the Brexit wing of the Tory party, because Switzerland accepts the free movement of labour from Brussels, it accepts EU market regulations, it makes annual payments to the block's budget, and they're all red lines to the European research group, the Brexit wing of the Conservative Party. But the problem is the office for budget responsibility estimates that Brexit will lower Britain's trade by 15 per cent a year in the long term, and at this moment Britain is desperate for growth. But here in Birmingham, at the CBI conference, I've just spoken to the Director General of the CBI Tony Duncan, and he says that Brexit won't be the silver bullet that fixes the labour market in the UK, and what business wants is a Brexit style deal that Boris Johnson arranged. We just want it to be implemented now, he says he. Now I'm going to put that very question to my next guest. It's Simon Eves, Chief Executive of Accenture UK and Ireland. Simon, thanks so much for joining me. Is what business wants a Boris Johnson style deal? It's what business wants stability, and it recognises that the Brexit debate in all of its forms will continue to run and run and run. What it needs is what it can do now, approaching this Christmas trading period and the start of the next year. And what we've shown is that business confidence is at an all-time low since 2009. Last week provided some stability. Where do we go for growth? We believe the UK has a 33 billion opportunity of growth through digitising the core of businesses. All of the funds will be a great place to start. Did the autumn statement last week help to reverse some of the damage in terms of business confidence from the minibudger in September? I think that's clear. The market's reacted in a positive way. Business seems calm, so the timing is now right for thinking about where we go for growth. That's what Tony's speech is all about. Are you convinced that the Conservatives are more focused on fighting... Well, as focused on fighting growth and inflation, as Labour perhaps would be. I think the party politics seem much of a muchness at the moment. What business needs is stability, clarity, certainly for the next year of fiscal policy, which seems in place, and now, businesses to step into the vacuum, invest itself, invest in R&D, invest in sustainability in its talent. It can't keep looking elsewhere. It needs to step into the vacuum itself. But in terms of the labour market, would closer ties with Europe help to fix this in activity problem? Well, it might do, but interestingly, I think business needs to look closer to home. We've got about 50% of those under 40, perhaps looking for a new...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1447,2022-11-21 07:38:12

So business needs to step up its game, with its agenda, supported by the government if we're to achieve our ambitions. Supported by the government, but what can the government do to ensure that business reaches those goals? So I think the sort of framework of support around renewable energy will be very positive. But also businesses have all sorts of sustainability issues in their value chains, which they need to change. And again, support for that would be the right thing to do.

OK, so, Jen, so loss and damage, as it's known, I think, in the lingo done to some extent, and at least progress on that front, as far as emerging markets have been calling for and can see here. Let's progress.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1449,2022-11-21 07:46:59
18835," on that front as far as emerging markets have been calling for and can see here. But less progress or no progress made on the rate that we see emissions come down and getting to COVID-0 essentially. So no movement on that side. Does that been quite a disappointment? Right, and I was just hearing your last guest talking about whether or not that 1.5 degree Celsius is still within reach. And that was a lot of the disappointment that we did here after this deal eventually came through because despite attempts by the US, India, the EU and others to phase out all fossil fuels, that didn't make it into the final text. And that is significant because that potentially does not get us on the path that we need to keep that 1.5 degrees and at least see our emissions peaking in 2025. And so what we heard from a number of negotiators and leaders, namely Franz Timmerman, who we saw running back and forth between meetings last week, is that he is afraid that we may have missed that potential to get on a better path. And there was a lot of lobbying going on from fossil fuel lobbyists, from oil producing states to not include this. And so when you think about again, COP28 being in Dubai, of course Dubai is a major producer of oil and gas. Many people think it's going to be even harder to get any stronger language into a cover decision for next year. So it depends who you speak to what the outcomes of this summit is. But that was our big takeaway, Anna. Jen, thanks so much. Jennifer Sampasagia there joining us from Shamil, shaped with the latest on COP27. Coming up, but after a fairytale fair well two years ago, a long time at Disney CEO Bob Igo returns. In fact, only a year ago because he stepped down as CEO two years ago but had other roles at the business just up until a year ago. But he's back at the entertainment giant. We'll get the details next. This is Bloomberg. There's more activity in the fusion world than ever and not just in government research labs. There's also an emerging private fusion industry that's attracted billions of dollars in capital in recent years. Governments and private investors alike realize that we've got to find a solution that's going to allow us to get to net zero targets. This is one of the hardest but most rewarding problems that humanity could work on. Ultimately, we all want the same thing. We want someone to put electricity on the grid from a fusion power station as quickly as possible. Frankly, the scale of the challenge, 3000 gigawatts of fossil fuel to replace. There's not many things that can do that. In fact, there may only be fusion that can really do that. And while many in the scientific community predict fusion power will take decades, some in the private fusion space, believe we'll get there in just a few years as soon as the 2030s.

Let's get a blue book first word news update, Alice Akins joins us with a briefing as you start, in fact with China Alice. Hi Anna, a city near Beijing that was rumored to be a test case for removing virus restrictions across China has asked residents to stay at home for five days. A potential sign officials are reverting to tighter Covid zero curbs. Meanwhile, the country's first Covid related death in almost six months has sparked concern that Beijing could see a return of restrictions. The report comes amid a continuing outbreak in the capital. Malaysia's political leaders now have until 2pm Tuesday local time to decide on a Prime Minister. The King has extended the deadline by 24 hours after Saturday's vote resulted in the country's first ever hung parliament. Opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim says he has the numbers to form a government despite falling short of a simple majority.

Global news 20 hours a day on air and on Bloomberg quick take powered by more than 2700 journalists and analysts in more than 100 and 20 countries. This is Bloomberg Anna. Let's get to some news from the inter-samellum technology sector. Disney says former CEO Bob Iger is to return to his old job effective immediately. Iger stepped down as chief executive in 2020 after leading the company through a period of enormous growth over 15 years. He remained on the board of directors for another year. So has been away about a year. Let's talk to Alex Webb from Bloomberg Quicktake who is with us on set here in London. Alex will start a conversation on Disney. There are lots of other stories in this space to cover right now. Why has Disney bought Bob Iger back one or two years after he left depending on how you define leaving? The simple answer is the share price. It's down about 50% from its peak in March last year. The reasons for that are obviously quite complex. There's a lot of internal morale issues where he has made decisions that haven't internally been necessarily totally popular. The company has been pivoting towards streaming. That was something that had been pushed forward by activists and investors. At the time Netflix was trading it about 50 times forward earnings. Investors looked at that and said we'd like a piece of that. Thank you very much. They did so and the share price was rewarded as a consequence. Since then Netflix obviously has not had a brilliant year. It's subscribed and now has stagnated and Disney has followed it downwards. It is now trading at a discount to Netflix again 22 times forward earnings versus Netflix is 27 times forward earnings. That battle on the streaming side. Clearly dominating a lot of the conversation away from Disney then. But sticking with the media tech space I guess. Alex Twitter very much in focus over the weekend. Elon Musk creating a lot of headlines by questions around which account he's going to reopen and which not. As well as more conversation about further layoffs despite a lot of criticism about the level of moderation that must be happening on the platform with so few staff. Yes. Firstly we had just the week full ask he said that they want to be able to commit to hardcore Twitter and if they were employees yes my apologies and hardcore insects at the work ethic right that he wanted people to say I'm one ball for this more people quit than he had expected but crucially those people who quit were largely in engineering. What he is now looking at is the sales teams and going actually the sales teams over staff we need to cut that too. At the same time he's talking about bringing back Trump now that is something that would presumably increase engagement in the platform. Trump had something like 80 million followers there were 250 million daily active users of Twitter. But those followers are only that engagement is only useful if you're able to generate ad sales and actually at the moment we're seeing that brands are massively pulling back from Twitter they're very nervous about seeing their ads alongside problematic content is Donald Trump the person who's going to improve the quality of that content I would suspect not necessarily. And a lot of advertisers might just simply have questions about how these decisions are being made about whether to allow accounts to operate or to be reopened based on the way that it",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1450,2022-11-21 07:51:12
18837," being made about whether to allow accounts to operate or to be reopened based on the way that it was conducted over the weekend with what seems to be a poll which ended 48-52. These things often do. Let me ask you about crypto because there we've got a lot of headlines being generated as well. For years of contagion in the industry as the fallout from FTX spreads, you know, another day, another FTX headline or two. Yes, they think there's about $3.1 billion worth of debt owed to creditors are owed $3.1 billion I should say. And largely these are the institutional, certainly company investors. That means that they are not looking good in terms of whether they're going to get that money back. That has implications for the broader crypto space. Are they going to try to cover their losses by selling down assets held elsewhere? That perhaps has implications for the Bitcoin price which is already at 16,000, it's down I think 75% or so from its peak. The people who are probably going to be lost on the chain to get their money in terms of people with holdings in through FTX are the retail investors and as ever, they are going to be left holding carrying the can for a lot of this. Third party, of course, almost certainly not going to see any of their money back. The people who've actually invested in FTX itself, big venture funds like Sequoia, like Tiger Global. Okay, it's a lot of questions about whether they did due diligence as with so many of the aspects of people who've looked at FTX. Yeah, really interesting lines. I saw the Fed's cash car we're talking about, the nonsense of crypto just ahead of the weekend which I thought was interesting and Bitcoin down just below 16,000 now in fact with the 15,000 handle. So we watch as that one moves lower. Alex, thanks very much. Alex Web joining us from Bloomberg Quique take with some of the news lines surrounding the tech media space over the weekend. Coming up, we will look at your stocks to watch including the meal kick company Hello Fresh which gets an upgrade from Goldman. This is playback. What do you think of when you think of a battery? For most, it's what we use to power devices for both work and play and maybe even your car. Over the past few decades, they've gotten way more powerful, long lasting and affordable. But all of this is just a prologue to what the next batteries are going to do. As we drive to an increasingly renewable power driven grid, we also need to be able to store energy and release it later to cover those periods of weather intermittencies that are driving this new grid that we're in. It's a multi trillion dollar opportunity and it's imperative that we figure out the solution here. How we store energy on a massive scale is in many ways the central challenge of the fight to stop climate change. Welcome back to Bloomberg Market's Europe. We still have seven minutes until the start of cash equity trading this Monday morning. Let's get to Joe Eastern who joins us from our equities team to take us through some of the stocks in focus this morning. Good morning to you Joe. Hello Fresh very much in focus. I don't know whether this is a business model that benefits from sporting activities and people cooking at home. You give me the link. Yeah, potentially. I mean, trading volumes might be liked today given England are playing at one o'clock, but we do have some news on Hello Fresh so they...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1451,2022-11-21 07:55:28
18838," Give a season people cooking at home. You give me the link. Yeah, potentially. I mean, trading volumes might be light today, given England are playing at one o'clock, but we do have some news on Hello Fresh. So they're getting an upgrade at Goldman Goldman saying people should buy this stock, given they are on tracks for profitability within the next couple of years. And they've also got a very strong balance sheet as well. That stocks down around by half this year or even more, as you can see on the chart there, and Goldman sees around 80% upside for the shares. They do caution that it hasn't yet been tested during recession. So it's yet to see whether we will see cancellation rates for those subscribers. OK, yes. I mean, maybe the end of trading today here in London is somewhere around five to one this afternoon. Sure, perhaps a pass. Let us get to Virgin Money then some news flows around in this business and a buyback. That's right. So the company has announced a £50 million buyback and also some strong profit numbers as well, given they're getting a boost from the interest rates as the Bank of England pushes up those base rates there. However, they have announced a £50 million impairment as well. So this is bad loan expected to come through as the recession takes hold. That might seem like a small amount, but probably a sign of things to come, given the exposure to the mortgage market which we know is slowing. They also do pass on a lot more of the Bank of England hikes to the positives. So potentially see less of a boost than companies like that. OK, and just briefly, Julius Bear. So Julius Bear, seeing around $4 billion worth of flows coming back into the business, after they saw massive outflows in the last reporting period as the market declined. So it looks like some of the investor appetite returning and that's helping the company to fund an expansion in areas like South America and also Asia. It's a pretty positive one for Julius Bear today. Joe, thank you very much. Bill Bakes, Joe Easton doing his best to keep his eyes on the stocks despite the football action. Thank you very much. That is it for this hour of programming the open. He's coming up next, of course, five minutes until the start of equity trading. The team will be here to take you through the open shortly. This is Lingberg. A digital first approach to the future work is where the industry and all companies will be heading. Put the future work not be at home or in the office, but in the metaverse instead? There's that word, metaverse. Good. Well, how are you doing? When I think about the metaverse, I think about immersive experiences that happen to me. I think that the future work is a good thing. I think that the future work is a good thing. I think about the metaverse, I think about immersive experiences that have a sense of active presence. Wow, look at this. This is me.

18839," specifically younger voters. Bringing you the political news you need to know. The president has made it very clear that this is a significant focus. For the intersection of Wall Street and Washington, nobody covers politics like Bloomberg. We're in the early stages of a sustainability revolution that has the magnitude of the industrial revolution coupled with the speed of the digital revolution. Nobody covers climate change like Bloomberg, your global business authority. It's a really a reminder, isn't it? Just how sensitive the markets are to any commentary about trade. We did see pressure on the U.N., we did see pressure on the futures. That is now being reversed. Welcome to the European market open everyone. A minute to go until the start of cash. I could be trading in front of Seenlacquant in London with Tom McKenzie. And here are your top stories. COVID-0 concerns, stocks drop, treasuries and the dollar gain. As Beijing Titans curbs amid a resurgence of the virus, including the first fatalities since May. Seeking the old magic Bob Iger makes a surprise return as Disney CEO amid a string of disappointing results and a slumping share price. Plus, towering decks. Court papers show that Sam Bankman freeds bankrupt FTXOs. It's 50 biggest, unsecured creditors more than $3 billion. We have some pretty interesting stories today that we'll get through. This is a picture for the futures. As Tom was saying, it's all about concern in China and the fact that we could see this COVID-0 policy stop and start again. So there's definitely moved to shelters such as for example, treasuries and dollar. And you can see pressure, deck futures and FTXOs down through Tens of weeks. Yeah, the move to shelters quite pronounced. Two key factors as you touch on. It is China and it is concerned about Fed Hawks as well. We had that push back from officials last week. But as China's front and center and the complexities around moving away from COVID-0, just being underscored by what is happening in places like Shujajuan, which is about 180 or so kilometers away from the capital Beijing. Currently, you're seeing the FTZ100 down 310s of A-Basenters investors here digest that news. The CBI conference, by the way, under way in Birmingham will be gauging the business reaction to that autumn statement of last week. The current urban France down by 310s of a percentage of the Spanish Ibex in similar territory of, by 19 points and over in Germany, the DAX down at this stage by 210s of A-Basent. Let's see how things are playing out cross asset. Then we look ahead to the US. US markets, US equities just ended the week lower. European equities just notching gains towards or for the full week. The context is you're gaining about 6% across the month for US equities. But today, futures pointing lower by 410s of a percentage, Euro Dollar under pressure because of dollar strength, that moving to the green back 102 on the single currency down by 610s of A-Basent. The benchmark at 381 on your 10 year and just that inversion between the 210s remains pronounced around recession fears. And Brent, $87.00 about WTI, by the way, dropping below $80 a barrel for the first time since September. This again, time to the China story concerns about demand down by 410s of percent on Brent. Fancy. Now, China may tighten Tom Covid curbs after a string of reported deaths, which has led to declines in Asian stocks and a bid for haven assets. That's exactly what we were talking about. So joining us now to unpack all of this for us is Enda Kern, Archive H.I. economic correspondent Enda. Good afternoon or good morning. We've seen a lot of optimism recently in China. That seems to have ebbed away with today's news. So what's the latest? Well, it will be a big test of that optimism, Francine. As Tom was saying, this particular city, not too far from Beijing, was actually rumored to have been something of a pilot zone for how China might transition away from Covid. Well, in fact, we're getting news now of fairly severe restrictions there, an ongoing testing regime, something of a lockdown going in place there because of an outbreak. Now, what economists are saying is that obviously cases in China are continuing to hit multi-month highs. We're now getting news of fatalities. The first is that big Shanghai lockdown back in March, April. And of course, we're heading into the winter season. So it's obviously going to be a big test of how China does try to manage its transition away from Covid-09. To be clear, China still is seeking to very strict rules on the coming to managing Covid. It has quarantine requirements. It has the underground testing.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1453,2022-11-21 08:04:15
18840," It's transitioning away from COVID-19. To be clear, China is still seeking to very strict rules when it comes to managing COVID. It has quarantine requirements. It has the underground testing and restrictions. So China has a long way to go. But of course, it has been signaling some softening of that regime by trying to target these measures. They're not going for mass broad-based lockdowns, a damage economy. But this news now, these spreading cases and the particular restrictions are imposing in this particular city, for example. I think is your reminder of just how far China has to go. And it will be a test of the optimism for where China is at on the trajectory of moving away from COVID-19. And end of briefly, when those who have exposure to China, those interested in the developments in China looking very closely, of course, at COVID-19. But also the property market. And early this morning, we had some reaction at least an announcement around further steps to try and support that part of the economy, that sector. What do we know? What are the details? So this came from a meeting between the regulators, including the central bank, Tom, with some of the big lenders. The essential message was there were some technical measures rolled out, including ensuring there is sufficient support for those who are borrowing in the real estate market, ensuring there's sufficient credit and liquidity for those who needed to ensure the housing sector keeps taking over. The backstory is it gels with recent measures from the government that recent 16-point plan where they're rolling out steps to put a floor onto the housing sector. And economists say this could prove to be a game changer for that part of the economy over the months ahead. Okay, excellent. As ever, Bloomberg's end of current out of Hong Kong on the latest when it comes to the property sector and the challenges around implementing some of those easing measures around COVID-19. Joining us now is Klaus Bardet, global chief economist at South Jen corporate investment banking. Klaus, good morning to you on this Monday morning. On China, you say in your notes to us that you're becoming more certain that China does reopen in 2023. What would that mean for the European economy, a reopen China? Well, it would mean, first of all, that there's a reduced risk that we get again intensified supply chain issues. I think that's one. And the second one too is, of course, that it's going to be good for a private consumption. You know, as we've seen in recent data, retail sales, for example, the threat of lockdowns, of course, has made Chinese consumers very hesitant. Now, you know, it applies. Goods are concerned. Chinese consumers, of course, primarily consume goods that are made in China, but not exclusively. It's of course a huge market for luxury, for European luxury producers. And so it would be good news if China reopens, that's for sure. Klaus, how quickly do you think we'll get to a reopen China that can sustain the world economy? There are also a huge concerns about property and maybe asset bubbles. Well, I'm not so sure about the asset bubble. You know, there's always an idea that beholder. The real estate is definitely going to be a long-term story. You know, the demographics alone in China suggest that real estate is not going to be on the real estate sector isn't going to be anything like the support it was for economic growth in China. And so I think China, in that sense, will have entered a much slower trajectory of economic growth. But I think as far as reopening, they're going to be very careful through the winter. Winter is always a bit more dangerous period for COVID, for flu, for all of these infectious diseases. So it's going to be, you know, sometime early in 2023 when China really does reopen and really permanently or hopefully permanently, lastingly, will access all these restrictions. Okay, so we looked at early 2023 as we, in the moment, to hear and now see how complicated it is to move forward on that front for Chinese officials. When it comes to the trade component, Klaus, exports such a key driver, particularly through the pandemic for that economy, what is the data telling you now about the resilience of China's export sector? Well, you know, there is, you know, clearly, global trade has benefited from the shift of consumers away from services towards goods. And you know, that shift, I think, is unwinding gradually. I mean, trade has been a good trade and goods has been remarkably resilient, much more resilient than...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1454,2022-11-21 08:08:33
18841," is unwinding gradually. I mean, trade has been a good trade in goods, has been remarkably resilient, much more resilient than people expect than that, because demand for goods didn't fall off a cliff once, people you know had bought their new IT equipment and maybe some new furniture etc. as people shifted towards working from home and to homeschooling and all these things. But what I definitely see is that there's now a shift of holds, i.e. a shift of strength, because China and a few other Asian economists, Taiwan, Korea, very very strong in IT and those things were of course very much demanded. And so I think global trade is going to be fairly resilient, but we're seeing a shift away from Asia. Overall, do you think we've touched peak inflation in the U.S. and elsewhere? We're very close. You know, when you look at upstream price indicators, be it energy, be it transportation costs, all of those things, food that have pushed inflation up, they're all rolling over or have already rolled over. So I think we're probably at very close to to peak inflation. In the UK it's probably around the turn of the year in the first quarter of the year next year. But at the same time, I think that doesn't mean that we're going to now switch to go back to 2 percent because in my view, what is taking over now rather than upstream price measures is wage costs. And in Europe, the big wage acceleration is only just beginning. And in the U.S., I distrust the signs of slightly weaker wage growth. Certainly in the UK, we're looking at strikes because a lot of people want their wages put up. Klaus, thank you. Klaus Bodr, the Global Chief of Economy, the Socialist, the Digital and Corporate Investment Banking, stays with us. Coming up a bit of a humble pie, central banks seem to be accepting they did not act as fast as they could do to control inflation. So we discuss that next. This is Bloomberg. There is an epic saying in Italy when it comes to family generations that the first generation creates the second generation expands and the third generation destroys. And that's almost what happened in the Gucci story. So, Hétun, I love you. Now I would have had much more experience about those who say that love you and then they'll trade you. The Gucci family was the strength but also the weakness of the label. The situation became dire with Gucci's finances. They were not able to pay salaries. They were not able to pay suppliers. Gucci is really teetering on the brink at this stage. There's a lot of ground to cover. So, I'm going to show you what's happening in ETFs like no one else.

When US jobs numbers are released, Bloomberg brings you crucial data at terminal speed and instant expert analysis. Nobody covers jobs day like Bloomberg. Welcome back to the Open. Everyone 11 minutes into the European trading day. This is a picture across the board that stocks falling as Thomas saying there's a lot of concern on China. The fact that they may tighten COVID curbs after a string of reported deaths. And of course the impact that has not only in the administration across the world, but also on just the world economy. Yeah, absolutely. So that anticipation that we saw last week of maybe some of those measures being eased. We know that officials put out this 20 point plan or so. And just the challenges in terms of implementing that when you have soaring cases. So that is a conundrum for officials in Beijing. And then we look every day about who's right. Is it equities or actually bonds? So central banks desperately trying to write in inflation and inflation problem that was allowed to spiral out of control. That's eroded their credibility in the eyes of investors and society at large. What Larry Summers is the latest to blame the Fed for dragging its heels. I think that the Fed has this in the right place when it says that they're going to move up somewhat more and they're going to take stock of the situation. I have to say that if they hadn't made as many mistakes as they did of excessive optimism about inflation, they probably have a little more room than they do. I mean, I don't think I've ever heard Larry Summers actually say anything good about any central bank to be fair. Yeah, well, he was out front. He was out front, right, with his calls that they were not going quickly enough. They needed to address it and they need to raise rates. And the area is, again, saying they still have some work to go. Yeah. So if you look forward, what can they do to correct the course? Let's get back to class, butter, global chief economist, that's the decision I had, corporate and investment banking class. If we assume that central banks were wrong, although inflation did come in quite thick and fast, what do they now need to do to make sure that people believe them, that they're credible? Well, they don't really have a whole lot of means. Do they mean they have to, of course, pursue interest rate normalization, or actively go to a stance that is somewhat restrictive? And they have to unwind their bounce sheet. So take away that stimulus. But yeah, it wasn't just the Fed. I would say the Fed wasn't really the worst. I'd say that probably the ECB takes a cake when it comes to being laid and they're fooling itself into the narrative that inflation was temporary. You know, I looked at them as I was writing our latest global economic article. I looked, it was in June 2021 when we were already writing that mantra policy was completely out of whack with economic reality. So this was obvious for quite a long time. And Clouster Kauras in terms of what we're hearing from Fed officials and others who've watched the Fed are looking at a terminal rate of above 5%. What does that do to your view around the relative resilience of the US economy? Well, we think that the economy does have quite a lot of resilience. And there are a few factors behind that. I mean, the most important for me is definitely what I call excess savings. How's the saved enormous amounts of money during the COVID crisis? Now, Americans almost have begun to dip into those excess savings. But in Europe, they really have not, or at least as far as they have data. In Germany, they probably did in the most recent quarter, IE, that we know of the third quarter. But I think that gives a whole lot resistance to the economy. And with yields and earnings as high as they are, I think that the economy is unlikely to fall into a big black hole. I mean, we think that the concerns about the US recession are either overdone or overblown or at least premature. We don't think that the US economy is going to meet recession before maybe early 2024. Class, we talk about the tensions, which Tom and I love talking about. The bond market gets right or what it gets wrong. And a lot of people think that the bond market in general is just a lot smarter about what the Fed needs to do and what it's going to do. At the moment, they're basically telling us that they won't be able to get its rates up to 5% nor will it need to. Are they right? I'm not 100% sure why you think.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1456,2022-11-21 08:17:17
18843," to get its rates up to 5% nor will it need to? Are they right? I don't know 100% sure why you think that the bond market is saying that. It's certainly saying that that period is going to be relatively brief, because we still have, of course, long-term yields which are significantly below 5% or just about 5% where we think Fed funds are going to go. I'm a little bit skeptical about this level of long-term interest rates. I think we've just gotten used to in the last 10, 15 years to these very low bond yields. And I don't think it's unlikely. Completely unlikely. There were maybe going to go back to bond yields, which we used to consider normal before 2010. So yields are somewhere in the 4% to 5% range and that they're going to stick around in that region. I think that's definitely possible. And for my mind, the demographics are also pointing that direction. But that's a bit choppy. And people disagree on that quite a lot. Yeah, I guess the reference there was to the US 10 year, of course, the yield has come down fairly precipitously over the last few weeks. It was at, what, 420? Currently, 381 on the 10 year. When it comes to what's happening in the UK, you also have a fairly nuanced view. I mean, a lot of hangaring, a lot of anxiety in the back of the autumn statement and pretty dire predictions from the OBR last week. But you don't think the recession is going to be two calamities here in the UK. Well, we think that we definitely think that the recession has already started. We think that it's a recession that's going to drag on for quite a long time, a 4 or 5 quarter recession. That's a long recession. Yeah, but it's true. We don't think that there's going to be a complete collapse and that it's going to be a terribly deep recession. And I come back to the point that I made earlier. In the UK, you also have these enormous household savings. And so household balance sheets are certainly in all those economies where fiscal policy has been very active. Household balance sheet are incredibly healthy and natural to help cushion the economic pressures. And in particular, in the UK, the interest rate pressures, the UK is exceptional too. I think in its fiscal pressures, there's a lot of fiscal consolidation pressures. And then, let's not forget, the aspect which is economic poison. Yeah, the economic poison of Brexit.

This is a picture for European stocks that are down between two-tenths and four-tenths of 8%. No matter what we need to talk about is a Swedish housing market. I know Tom and I, especially Tom, we really want to talk about this. The reason why this is important because we are seeing around, and usually these are just hiccups. Sweden has been pretty much stable and so the fact that there is a huge route could spell big trouble ahead for other countries. Right, and what exactly? Whether it's the canal in the coal mine for the broader global housing market and you're talking about and you're looking at places like Australia and New Zealand, here in the UK of course. So, seven straight months where housing prices have fallen in Sweden. Somehow, prices have dropped by as much as 14%. So, again, given what is happening in Sweden, they had a big run-up particularly during COVID. We saw that in other markets. How much of this is a nod to what may happen in places like the UK where some economists have looked to potentially downside as much as 20%. But I know you're fascinated in just how to build a house in Sweden. You buy them on a catalog which I'm obsessed by, but on a more serious economic point. A lot of young people, they have never experienced housing market crafts, which people here in the UK have, and at the same time, corrections have been shallow and very short-lived. So, one to watch. Now let's get straight to the Bloomberg business flash. Here's Alice Atkins. Hi Alice. Hi Francine. Walt Disney is bringing back former CEO Bob Iger to run the company. The 71-year-old spent more than four decades at Disney, including 15 years as chief executive. The company says he's agreed to serve for two years, succeeding Bob Chaperk, who is leaving immediately. Disney shares are heading towards their worst annual loss since at least the 1970s. The IMF says the rise of trade barriers against China and other countries over the past year could cost the global economy $1.4 trillion. Fund manager Kristalina Gjordieva says the potential loss for Asia could be more than 3% of GDP because the region is more integrated into the global value chain. The world is going to lose 1.5% of GDP just because of divisions that may split us into two trading blocks. This is $1.4 trillion. For Asia, the loss is much more significant because Asia is so integrated in global value chains. It could be 3% or more. That's your Bloomberg business flash, Tom Francine. Thank you. Crypto prices continue to fall in the ongoing crisis sparked by the downfall of San Bank when freed once. FTX Empire, over the weekend it emerged that FTX owes its 50 biggest unsecured creditors a total of $3.1 billion USD. That's bringing Alex Webb, who leaves our tech and media coverage from Bloomberg, a quick take. Alex, just every day, every 24 hours or so, we get an update in terms of the turmoil inflicted on these crypto markets by SBF and the downfall of FTX. What is the importance around the creditors situation? $3 billion USD that's owed? If there are a lot of companies, and it seems like there are 50 companies named there with between them size 1 amounts of capital invested through FTX, if a significant part of their resources is in that, then it has...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1458,2022-11-21 08:25:56
18845," in there with between them size when amounts of capital invested through FTX. If a significant part of their resources is in that, then it has risks of contagion for their balance sheets. Do they have enough capital to survive? Even if they do have enough capital to survive, does that mean they need to sell down assets elsewhere that then has other implications for the prices of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies? So there's a lot of things we don't know that could be creating bigger problems for the space. Alex, I have a rather bizarre question, but actually there seems to be some rich space on what's going on with Twitter. Elon Musk is tweeting every two seconds that the media has like wall-to-wall coverage on Twitter. Are we not spending enough time talking about FTX? Like, which is the biggest story? Well, the cover story of Business Week this week is about FTX. I think I certainly think of Bloomberg. We're giving it plenty of attention. I generally think that there's way too much coverage of Twitter as a whole, because less, it has a certain amount of influence when it comes to election cycles and things in the US. But ultimately, it is a small company. In the grand scheme of things when it comes to selling a valley, it's 250 million users. Its revenue is less than BT's profit. It's pre-eal on, we should say. We're on for the same right now, it's getting even worse. So it has an outsized influence when it comes to the thing that venture capitalists and web-three enthusiasts are super enthusiastic about. It is the broader crypto space. This is having big implications for that. Now, some of the optimists, this, this, if you turn, if you turn, if you turn, in for instance, they've found one of the leaders of Ethereum. He's saying, well, this shows why decentralization is actually important. Because when you have any sort of centralized institution of some sort, then things start to go awry. So inevitably, the crypto web-three enthusiasts are sort of saying, well, this is, reinforces our thesis rather than detracting from it. They're very, very good at pivoting on a crisis, aren't they? When it comes to, when it comes to the question of twist, and it was interesting your point on the relevance, I think a really important question as well. And so Martin Sorrell, to just point into us when we spoke to him about how ministerial it is when it comes to ad revenues, just very briefly reinstating present Trump, the controversies there, more advertisers could pull. If they haven't pulled already, a lot of them are already pulling back. I guess this is the question of whether they're going to come back. And if he is going to bring in a certain sort of audience, and there's not going to be enough calling out of untruths on Twitter, which if they're tamping back on on the kind of quality team, then that is the risk, particularly towards the election. Alex, thanks so much, Alex Web, from Bloomberg. Quick take, coming up, but we're live at the CBI conference, where are the Prime Minister's set to address the UK's biggest business group? That's next, this is Bloomberg. You've been advised at the President's United States on infrastructure and manufacturing, but on infrastructure, you've been involved with the legislation that was passed not long ago. Why is the United States infrastructure so terrible compared to so many other wealthy countries? I have been around US politics like you for a couple of decades and have served a variety of presidents from the different parties. And the attitude in the United States is obviously to keep taxes low and keep the public spend under control. And the word control is interesting, but that stops forward thinking in terms of planning. And therefore, the short-termism around our fiscal policies has hurt us. I mean, in essence, you infrastructure is a long-term return. And to give...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1459,2022-11-21 08:30:15
18846," in terms of planning and therefore the short termism around our fiscal policies has hurt us. I mean in essence you infrastructure is a long term return and to get a long term return putting it into private hands is one way of doing it but really the public side of life has to be willing to brew the forward spend. The forward spend on airports and roads and EV charging stations has to come from the public domain. Now raising taxes to spend money on infrastructure means you've got to trust the people doing the spending and I think the public private model is the way to go there which is actually create an infrastructure bank that these US public sector owned that has private sector matching funds. I think that sort of breakthrough has yet to occur in the United States so where we go is tax and spend which unfortunately one side of y'all disagrees with.

Let's get straight to Bloomberg's Jennifer's Abbasaja in Sharma shake and someone Foxman in doa to very different stories to very important story So Jen what's actually been agreed regarding this new fund at cop Yeah, friend I think the key word that you just said there's new and that's what a lot of developing nations were hoping for coming out of this cop So it is a new agreement to establish a lost and damaged fund for developing nations That is what was agreed upon what was not agreed upon was the terms of the steel and what it will look like who are the countries that are going to be a Part of this fund who is even considered developing in this day and age because when the UN first started this framework back in 1992 China Saudi Arabia and other major countries were considered developing and of course today that is not the case So what needs to be figured out as part of this loss and damage fund is How is it going to work? How is it going to be classified and then it will start and they'll start to figure out how much is going to be included and When these first things will actually start happening so there is a meeting a committee that is going to be set up Starting in March of 2023 to start working this out and of course get things hopefully moving in the right direction heading into Dubai cop 28 And Jen, of course, it was a compromise. It was a torture compromise. It was messy What has the reaction been from climate activists and from those in the business community and indeed policymakers around this eventual deal? Right, I mean depending on who you speak to it's a different reaction Mainly from policymakers what we heard Let's just start with someone like John Kerry right. He's been on the ground here for the past two weeks Saying that this was a successful Cop congratulating Egypt for the progress that we did see coming out of it Of course the US and China did reestablish communications Talking about climate but when you talk about the 1.5 degrees Celsius That that the goal that we want to keep the world below that degrees There's a little bit of disappointment that there wasn't any stronger language put into this final cover decision from Glasgow There were a lot of fossil fuel lobbyists reportedly here on the grounds and working to Not include that bold language of phasing out all fossil fuels and so a lot of upset a lot of them People were pretty upset about the final language not being stronger not being bold or not getting us closer on this path To keeping below the 1.5 degrees All right, Jen. Thank you so much Simone. So you're at the World Cup and it's not really about football It's first of all about all of the controversies and also the president of FIFA with a pretty Incredible price conference over the weekend Yeah, very strong statements in support of the Qataris and essentially against some of the criticism They've been receiving but some of that controversy has focused on what might happen on the ground How will security officials deal with drunk fans? How will they deal with people who go walk around waving rainbow flags and flanking? We haven't seen that if you go out to the fan areas the fan festivals They've been pretty empty.

18850," in the game after most people had already made their travel plans. We're also going to be watching very closely the England-Iran match. A lot of interesting matches today, but that's the one where there's probably a lot of political controversy. There are massive protests going on in Iran. The team, this Iranian soccer team, typically co-opted essentially by the regime for national fervor, and that's a very divisive issue. At the same time, we'll see Harry Kane whether or not he wears this one-love arm band representing LGBTQ rights, even if he faces fines and a booking because of it. All right, Krutzeney on Harry Kane and how he maybe potentially pushes back on some of these rights abuses that have been flagged in Qatar. And talking of those abuses and the controversy, how have those corporate sponsors kind of reacted to the whirlwind of controversy and a hand-ringing and angst around this event? If this is a really good question that I was struggling with because this is the most controversial world cup probably in recent memory. And over the last couple of years, corporates brands have embraced social impact in ESG. But I got in touch with 76 brands sponsoring either national teams in the US, Canada, and Europe where criticism has been widespread or FIFA sponsors based in those areas. Very few of them told me that they are changing their marketing strategy in any way because of some of the human rights issues that Qatar has faced. 13 of them ultimately said they were, but only three of those 13 actually had even tenuous business ties to Qatar. So brands talk big about ESG, but in reality when it comes to add dollars, when it comes to billions of eyeballs, it don't seem to be doing quite as much. Yeah, indeed. So we have England, Iran, later today, and then Wales, USA as well, around 7pm UK time, I believe. Thank you very much.

Even human waste is in demand as farmers hunt for alternatives. Fertilizer helps increase crop yields. You can see how much moisture is held into this.

The nutrients in, the water in, really increases the kind of bite and anacrofoil the soil. The recent price spike could mean more farmers going organic for the long term. A multi-trillion dollar industry. There's a lot of ground to cover. Come on, these got absolutely crushed. We'll show you what's happening in ETFs like no one else. Bloomberg ETF RQ Monday on Bloomberg. Why do the biggest names in business choose Bloomberg? It's a great question. It's a great question. Great question. Best question I get all night. Bloomberg Top Experts Great Questions. Welcome back to the open. Everyone 52 minutes into European trading day. Still a bit of pressure on European stocks for the DAX down 510s of 8%. To all eyes on China. Disney says former Chief Executive, Bob Iger, is to return to his old job effectively. Well, Iger stepped down as Chief Executive in 2020 after leading the company through a period of enormous growth over 15 years. He remained on the board of directors for another year. Well, joining us now is Rachel Chang covering Disney. We also saw a share price. Actually, the ADR here in Europe beginning some 6.8% at the open. Why has Disney brought Bob Iger back, Rachel? Right. I mean, I think it's no surprise that the CEO that's just been outstored Bob J. Pack down has not been doing that. Well, Disney has had a very rough year. Its streaming platform is looking shaky with enormous losses. It's stock prices down 40% in one year, which is really the most it's ever dropped in pretty much since the 1970s. So, I think it's not a surprise that Disney will be looking for a new leader at this time. What is a surprise is that they will be turning to the previous guy in a Bob Iger who was obviously a very high profile, very successful CEO. You know, and to some extent, turning to the old guy right now speaks to another problem that Disney does have, which is that it doesn't have that bench of leadership talent. It doesn't have a bench of succession. That's going to be one of the challenges that people will be looking at Bob Iger to fix. And that was, yeah, Rachel, absolutely. That was a key question, wasn't it, towards the end of his reign. Bob Iger was who is going to replace you. They kept extending his contract and extending his contract. Look, you've touched on some of this. What are the challenges that Iger is going to face now is back in the hot seat? Right, exactly. And I think the immediate thing that the people are going to want to see from Iger is, you know, a stabilization of Disney's two most important businesses that theme parks and the streaming platform. You know, we know the streaming platform is still unprofitable. It's very competitive. 1.5 billion in losses in the last year. You know, they've been saying that they...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1465,2022-11-21 08:56:17
18852," theme parks and the streaming platform. You know, we know the streaming platform is still unprofitable. It's very competitive. 1.5 billion in losses in the last year. You know, they've been saying that they won that platform to be profitable in 2024. People are going to want to see that. At the same time, the theme parks are not bouncing back to the same sort of revenue that was expected post-pandemic. That's going to be really another important thing for IGA to stabilize. And you know, what you said as well, people want to know what's next, right? Because the problem is when will Disney ever get past the age of IGA? You know, is it always going to be circling this guy? Is that no other leader capable of bringing it to the next chapter? That's also going to be an existential question for the company. So Rachel, can you give us any insight? Is this because Bob Iger is a genius of business? Or is it because the other guy was just no good? I mean, Bob Chepack, you know, a string of missteps. Everybody knows the thing with Scarlett Johansson. You know, he's made a lot of gaps. The Florida don't say gay bill as well. You know, IGA, I think, is very closely associated with Disney's glory days, right? 15 years of uninterrupted growth. They bought Marvel. They bought Pixel. They just became this enormous company under Bob Iger. So there's this attachment to him as somebody who's going to steer Disney back onto safe ground. But at the same time, you know, what he's facing ahead is so different from the past. You know, now it's all about streaming. You know, the strategies that he used in the past are no longer relevant now. So the question once again is, really, can Disney chat that new future? Can Disney find that new direction beyond what Iger used to do? OK, really excellent context. Thank you very much. Indeed, Bloomberg's Rachel Chang on, of course, the story around Disney, the change in the media back to Bob Iger. Let's check it on the markets then before we let you go. You're currently seeing losses of 3.10 of a percent across the benchmark futures in the US. Also, by around 5.10 of a percent, yes, it is China and the concerns around COVID, the inability to extract themselves from COVID-0. And, of course, we're looking ahead to the FOMC minutes later this week following those officials and their hawkish comments, Francine. Now, that's it for the European market open. Surveillance early edition is up next. We'll continue covering the UK, the Brexit debates, and, of course, markets for the moment, lower, as Thomas saying. This is Bloomberg. A digital first approach to the future work is where the industry and all companies will be heading. Click the future work not be at home or in the office, but in the metaverse instead. How's that word? Metaverse. Good, well, how are you doing? When I think about the metaverse, I think about immersive experiences that have a sense of active presence. Wow, look at this. This is me. The metaverse is projected to become over a trillion dollar market by the end of this decade. And whether you know it or not, you'll probably be working there in the future. We're moving into a world where we're going to be interacting with computers with our bodies. This is definitely trippy. I think the adoption curve is going to be slow. It's weird.

Seeking the old magic, a cabobiger makes a surprise return as Disney Chief Executive amid a string of disappointing results and a slumping share price. And historic agreement negotiators at COP27 reach an 11th hour deal for a fund that compensates developing nations for climate devastation but falls short. On fossil fuels were live. Here's your omelchake. Now good morning. First of all, let's check on the markets. All, of course, about what the Fed does, but also China concerns after we see that China may tighten COVID curbs after a string of reported deaths. This is also having an impact on European stocks, down to 10 to 8 percent. The US 10-year yield, we did see this move into risk havens such as treasuries, but it's also such as dollar. The US 10-year yield at 381-19 and then stirring 1.1820. Now, the one story we also need to keep an eye on is Disney. It came as a surprise to a lot of people that they decided to bring back the Chief Executive that left two years ago. So, just on the back of that, we don't have any announcement of what he'll do to put Disney back in shape, but actually the stock price in German trading is up 10 percent. Now, the picture overall for Europe, and there are a lot of country-based concerns, or certainly stories that are different from one another. Now, the Ibex River in Spain is getting three tens of 8 percent. Here in the UK, the Prime Minister will also be in Birmingham addressing the CBI, our Lizzy Burden. Is there on the ground for us? There was quite a lot of debates on whether they were looking for a Swiss style agreement. The Brexit tears came up in arms over the weekend. Cat 40, down to some three tens of 8 percent, and then the DAX down 5-10 of 8 percent. Now, let's get straight to the Bloomberg. First, we're news with Alice Adley's. Hi, Alice. Hi, Francine. Malaysia's political leaders now have until 2pm Tuesday local time to decide on a Prime Minister. The King has extended the deadline by 24 hours after Saturday's vote, resulted in the country's first ever hung parliament. Opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim says he has the numbers to form a government, despite falling short of a simple majority. The cops' talks in Egypt have ended with an agreement to help developing nations face the devastation of climate change. Although the deal for a loss and damage fund paid for by rich countries is seen as a breakthrough, negotiators fail to agree further cuts in CO2 emissions. The UK government says it isn't seeking a new Swiss style relationship with the EU. The pushback comes after a Sunday Times report that Prime Minister Rishis and Axe Administration is exploring close economic ties with its European neighbours. Switzerland is a member of the European Free Trade Association and participates in the single market for most goods.

Alex, thanks so much, Al-Satkins here in London. Now, China made Titan COVID curbs after a string of reported deaths, which has led to declines in Asian stocks and a bit for haven assets. We're now joined by Trevor Greetham, head of multi-assets at Royal London Asset Management. Trevor, thank you for joining us. I mean, the market's definitely concerned about what's happening in China after we were expecting COVID-0 to be relaxed a little bit. What kind of China does the world economy and world markets need? It's a really good question. And I think this may be a bit counterintuitive, but we're still in this kind of topsy-turvy world where good news is bad news, because the markets are still really sensitive to interest rates and where the peak in Fed funds would be. And in our team, certainly, we're talking about a possible reopening of China next year as something that could keep inflation high, keep interest rates rising and therefore being bad for stocks. So it's a bit of a strange one, actually, that it's bad for earnings if China is shut down, but it's actually good in terms of the peak of interest rates. Yeah, so it is all about what the Fed does. And of course, where we see peak inflation at interest, where do you expect the terminal rate to be for the US? Oh, it's really hard to say. I mean, I... I often do get asked that. How really? Well, do you know... I think it's one of those things where you sort of... you look for the signs of what will cause the Fed to pause. And in my view, that either pause because unemployment has started clearly rising and you know what unemployment does. It gradually moves lower during expansion and you're waiting for that moment when it cracks, but when it cracks, it cracks. You know it when you see it. So we're waiting for that moment when the Fed is likely to... to pivot because of either rising unemployment or maybe there'll be a credit event that will cause them to step back. But we don't see either of those things yet. And so that means that what we're going to see... I mean, have we reached peak inflation? And when we've reached it, how do you know? Is it just literally month by month data that keeps on going down? Or is there a measure that you look for to preempt? Well, there are measures that can preempt. So inflation is more than one thing. And there's like a leading edge of inflation, if you like, that's already falling. So some commodity prices... If you look at surveys of things like supply chains, they're very much opening up. So there is lots of slack and supply chains now. So less focus on China and what it might do to supply chains. But core inflation measures, like wage inflation, service inflation, shelter, they can take a year to peak after the headline measures peak. So we're at that early edge now where it feels like the markets will be talking about falling inflation next year and headline measures should be falling. But that doesn't mean to say the federal immediately cut rates. Sure. Can we avoid a recession in the US? And overall, where's the leverage? Is this the biggest question that you need to try and answer as interest rates go up? And they're going up quite rapidly? Are there parts of the markets that you worry about funding? Yes. So can you avoid a recession in the US possibly? So I've heard the argument that inflation will fall so dramatically that real incomes will expand and there'll be no need for a recession. I'm really skeptical about it because if you look at things like housing, so you go back to the interest rate sensitive bits of the economy. Housing looks like it did in the mid-2000s. It's looking horrible. And this is a fed-induced recession. So I think it's very hard to avoid the recession. So where do you put your money? Well, at the moment, we were beginning to like government bonds. So beginning of last year, we were maximum underweight. Of this year, I should say, maximum underweight government bonds. But the way we look at next year, it should be a slowdown. But this time, with headline inflation measures dropping. And I think the long end of bond markets is starting to look interesting. OK, interesting. Trevor, thank you so much. Trevor Greeth, in the head of multi-asset at Royal London, asset management, states with us. We'll talk a little bit more about bonds, but we'll also talk about some of the corporates out there. Coming up, Disney soars as a media giant, brings back former leader, Baba Eiger, as chief executive. We'll have all of the details next.

So, Hating Love again. Now I would have had much more experience about those who say that love you and then they'll trade you. The Gucci family was the strength but also the weakness of the label. The situation became dire with Gucci's finances. They were not able to pay salaries, they were not able to pay suppliers. Gucci is really teetering on the brink at the stage. No one covers the world like Bloomberg. My team thinks 2023 we avoid a recession. I'm a little more skeptical about that.

This is Bloomberg's available. It's early edition of Fronting Lackway here in London. Now Disney has sword and pre-market trade after welcoming back the former chief executive, Bob Iger, to his old job effective immediately. Well, Iger stepped down as chief executive in 2020 after leading the company through a period of enormous growth over 15 years. Well, he remained on the board of director for another year. Joining us now is Alex Web of Bloomberg Quicktake and Trevor Greetham, head of multi-assets at Royal London Asset Management is still with us. Trevor will talk about corporates and some of the changes in general. What kind of leader you're looking for in companies. But this is incredible. I mean, this is an incredible story. So Bob Iger's back. The magic in them hasn't been so magic in terms of returns in the last couple of years. Estonishingly, Bob Chepack was awarded a new contract just over the summer. So the change here has been rapid. The thing that had happened with Disney is that activists investors had looked at the share price of Netflix and particularly the price to earnings ratio. It was trading something like 50 times forward earnings. Disney was trading around the 20s and they said, well, we'll have a piece of that. Thank you very much. You should be more like Netflix. That therefore Disney pivoted, investing significantly in the streaming platform, Disney Plus. Then got pretty close to Netflix as a price to forward earnings ratio, I should say. Then of course, we saw the fallout of the pandemic, conditions easing and Netflix. It's used in numbers stagnated. It's share price value. Disney followed it. I mean, I just find it incredible. So the share price in Germany at the moment in pre-market trading today is up 10%. I mean, they still have an activist investor on their back. Was it because the chief executive was shockingly bad or is it really because Bob Iger can turn this around once again? A lot of the commentary we've seen is that actually the messaging is kind of what's important. It's not necessarily there will be significantly changes in the strategy. The one thing that Bob Chepack had not been terribly good at communicating was actually how this capital that is being spent right now on content for the streaming platform might ultimately yield dividends. And...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1469,2022-11-21 09:13:36
18856," Interestedly good at communicating was actually how this capital that is being spent right now on content for the student platform might ultimately yield dividends. And you compare that with the impact internally on the culture where Bob Schaepp and Maiden's decisions, they weren't terribly popular. Try and move staff to Florida. Political things that he maybe hadn't been as outspoken on as Iger had, tends to support seemingly for Republicans as has been reported. Because there was an expectation that they would do very well at the midterms that has maybe backfired as we can see. So there's lots of moving pieces here. Ultimately, Bob Iger, steady pair of hands. It's only a two year contract. We'll have to see who else comes in. Trevor, I know you don't want to talk specifically about Disney, but does this show the difficulty of media companies? I mean, these are again, they have parks, they have now to make TV shows catering for a streaming service, which is what they bet on, or is this just a stamp kind of bad chief executive going, being replaced? I think stepping back a little bit, there's a general message in the markets for growth companies. So with the media, be their technology, where rising bond yields are seen multiples collapse in the stock market. And as a macro person looking at that, it's been very interesting to see how people immediately point the finger and say every chief executive of a growth company must be terrible. Their most recent decision must of course, the stock price to drop in 2022. That's not the message markets are giving at all actually. They're just derating the growth stocks because interest rates have changed. That said, in this environment, as a CEO, you do need to make sure you're not over investing in things which will be very economically sensitive in the recession. So the message to sort of scale back a little bit with some of these companies have taken, isn't because their last move was stupid, it's because the cost of money has changed. Yeah, and one of the things they say, I mean for IGRAS specifically, is that he is, for example, very popular with the rank and file workers. How do you choose what industries you want to be invested in right now? Well, I think it's a question as a top-down investor of that interest rate sensitivity, where that's starting to become more interesting and earnings resilience. And so if you can imagine that we're getting more interested in government bonds, that means there'll be sort of stable growth companies that could actually do very well, the consumer staples, or some of the technology media companies with more reliable earnings. I always enjoy your Twitter feeds and sometimes Trevor also gives it back to Elon Musk, or certainly you weigh in on some of the big ones. Well, I'm not the only one. You're not the only one. I mean, it's like a national obsession. Why are we so obsessed with what's happening to Twitter? Thanks for great copy. A lot of it, you know, it's so many moving parts. There's great, huge personalities, not least Elon, but some of the other people involved. It is a fascinating story. The thing I've long been trying to point out, Twitter is not a big company in the grand scheme of things. It has an outsize influence in terms of politics, particularly given who its audience of largely is. But the data point I often point to, Twitter's revenue is less than BT's profit. It is not a large company. It is not a big tech company, but it is very influential to look at Valley. Yeah, I know you also call it FTX, and this, you know, 50 creditors are owed something like 3 billion. What does that tell you about the space? You know, I'm one of these sort of skeptics that sort of back in 2017, I was sort of saying, I was being asked a lot, as an asset allocator, why don't you have an allocation to crypto generally? My view was there's no long-term track record, you don't understand its economic sensitivity, and it's very prone to fraud. And I think that's what we're starting to see here. So I think it does cast a bit of a pull over the space. All right, thank you both for joining us, Alex Webb. They're a Bloomberg quick take and Trevor Greeth. I'm also going to give them a follow on Twitter head of multi-assets at Royal London, asset management coming up, or live at the CBI conference, where the Prime Minister is set to address with UK's biggest business group that's coming up next and this is Bloomberg.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1470,2022-11-21 09:18:00
18857," B There's more activity in the fusion world than ever, and not just in government research labs. There's also an emerging private fusion industry that's attracted billions of dollars in capital in recent years. Governments and private investors alike realize that we've got to find a solution that's going to allow us to get to net zero targets. This is one of the hardest but most rewarding problems that humanity could work on. Ultimately, we all want the same thing. We want someone to put electricity on their grid from a fusion power station as quickly as possible. Frankly, the scale of the challenge, 3000 gigawatts of fossil fuel to replace. There's not many things they can do that. In fact, there may only be fusion that can really do that. And while many in the scientific community predict fusion power will take decades, some in the private fusion space, believe we'll get there in just a few years as soon as the 2030s.

According to the redacted list, entities linked to FTX owe their single biggest predator more than $220 million. Investors continue to pull funds from digital asset exchanges despite efforts to reassure markets about their stability. Walt Disney is bringing back former CEO Bob Aiger to run the company. The 71-year-old spent more than four decades at Disney, including 15 years as chief executive. The company says he's agreed to serve for two years, succeeding Bob Chapak, who is leaving immediately. Disney shares are heading towards their worst annual loss since at least the 1970s. Sweden's home prices decline accelerated in October, with values now 14% down from their peak earlier this year, according to data from Value Guard. It's the most severe housing slump in three decades, fueled by soaring inflation and central bank moves to curb price increases. The IMF says the rise of trade barriers against China and other countries over the past year could cost the global economy $1.4 trillion. Fund manager director Kristalina Jordie Eva says the potential loss for Aiger could be more than 3% of GDP because the region is more integrated into the global value chain.

I was, thank you so much, I was at Kinze in London. Now the former Treasury Secretary learns summers has a warning for your policymakers focus on building your own economic strengths in the contest with China rather than attacking them. Here's more from his conversation with Bloomberg TV. I think it's a mistake to be slavish about terror rules. The market thinks the number is going to be about five. I look at things and my sense is there's more room for that to be too low than there is for that to be too high. But it's pretty clear that we've had the big moves on this cycle and now we're going to be finishing that process off. But I think that the Fed has this in the right place when it says that they're going to move up somewhat more and they're going to take stock of the situation and see what the inflation data is saying and seeing what the inflation forecasts are saying when we get to next get to the spring of next fall spring winter rather spring of next year. I have to say that if they hadn't made as many mistakes as they did of excessive optimism about inflation they probably have a little more room than they do to rely on forecasts that hadn't yet proved out that inflation was going to come down. Larry, you and I talk a lot about monetary policy, even fiscal stimulus and things. But geopolitics have also factored increasingly and some of the issues having to do with the economy. This week we had what is potentially, we don't know if it is, an important development in the meeting of President Xi of China and President Biden. What do you make of those discussions and even ongoing discussions because now we have the USTR, a madam tie actually meeting with her counterpart. What do you make of the situation with China right now in the United States? Look as Churchill famously said, George Shaw is a lot better than Bang Bang. And so the fact that they had a meaningful conversation that lasted more than three hours, the fact that they both came out of the conversation with the sense that there had been satisfying dialogue, the sense that there are some follow on steps. I think that's all to the good. What it's really going to mean, what really is going to happen, is there going to be constructive movement out of those dialogues? I think that's something we're going to have to wait and see. We in the United States probably need to be careful about our evangelizing influence. I don't think it's really for us to tell China how they should organize their entire society. I think it's for us to stand up for some of our fundamental interests in security, in fair economic competition, but to leave it at that point, I think we're going to need to be very careful with respect to our diplomacy. Well, that was a former US Treasury Secretary Larry Somers speaking on the US and China to Bloomberg TV.

For most, it's what we use to power devices for both work and play, and maybe even your car. To the past few decades, they've gotten way more powerful, long-lasting and affordable. But all of this is just a prologue to what the next batteries are going to do. As we drive to an increasingly renewable power driven grid, we also need to be able to store energy and release it later to cover those periods of weather intermittencies that are driving this new grid that we're in. It's a multi-trillion dollar opportunity, and it's imperative that we figure out the solution here. How will we store energy on a massive scale is in many ways the central challenge of the fight to stop climate change.

I would say so much to Alice Atkins here in London. The negotiators at the UN COP27 climate summit have reached a historic last-minute deal on payments for climate damages. Let's get out to Bloomberg's Jennifer Zabashazra, who is in Shamao's sake. Finally, there's something new that's been agreed, but it's not the online-compassing deal that many were hoping for. It's not, Fran. You know that because you were here for the first week. Developing nations that we've been speaking to, we're noting that it took 30 years to even get loss and damage on the agenda. The fact that the summit is ending with the fund in and of itself is seen as a positive. We heard that from Pakistan's climate chief, who noted that this is the first positive milestone. And how the work will really begin on how to actually structure this. And that's going to be key for the transitional committee that is going to be tasked with deciding what this is going to look like, heading into COP28. But really, ending this COP, there's a lot of disappointment from a number of people who say that this COP really failed to deliver a stronger stance on mitigation. We know that there was a lot of calls from India, from the US, from the EU to potentially include the language of phasing out all thoughtful fuels. But instead, the final text includes just phasing down unabated coal, which is the same text that we saw from last year in Glasgow. And we heard Fran's temperament specifically noting that it's not enough of a step forward for our planet. So there's really a lot of different opinions out there right now. We did see a lot of progress on climate finance fronts for countries like Vietnam and Indonesia, but still Fran. Not exactly the outcome that I think everyone was hoping for ending this COP.

18861," Jen, thank you so much, Jennifer Zabezaja. There are four us in Charmone Shake at COP27. Now, stocks lower today, I'm concerned that China am a tight-in-covid curbs after a string of reported deaths. Investors are seeking shelter in the haven assets of treasuries and the dollar. And we're joined by Saxo Banks Chief Executive and founder. He's Kim Furnay for an exclusive conversation. Kim, as always, thank you so much for giving us a little bit of your time. You make a smarter on some of the macro trends and some of the opportunities out there for the market, participants, and the bank. What do you see unfolding over the next six months? How ugly will the markets get? Well, clearly we are still in quite a bit of a turmoil and I think many, many different things are hitting us. Climate crisis, walls, inflation, rising interest rates, soft stock markets. And I think it'd be unlikely also with everything we see in the crypto market and so forth that that would not be some fallout from this because clearly dead levels in the world are bigger than ever before. Interest rates are going up. So servicing the death should be more difficult. Clearly we have not seen any specific signs yet, at least not the grave ones. But I wouldn't anticipate that we're not kind of done with this. There will be delayed effects from everything we've seen now. And obviously there's still a lot of money, but I think it would be more difficult in this environment, not to see things very accelerating on the down. So Kim, what are you most worried about? I know of course it's inflation, it's a terminal rate, but do you worry about leverage that parts of the markets are fine when interest rates are at 1, even 2% and it gets much trickier at 5, 6%. I'm sorry, could you say that again? I didn't hear it. What's the problem? Yeah, I'm sorry about that. Yeah, Kim, I was going to ask you whether you saw a lot of concerns on leverage, whether parts of the markets are over leveraged so that it's, you know, there could be a liquidity squeeze or a crunch similar to 0.8. If parts of the markets go under as interest rates increase rapidly. Sure, well, I think for exactly that leverage is there due to much debt because debt really is leverage. And a state levels have never been bigger. Of course, this is a big problem when interest rates are going up. So I do think we will see some fallout from that. And I think it will obviously particularly hit the ones who do not have the proper solvency or capital or do not have appropriate cash flow. So I would think of it unlikely that we do not see some fallout from that leverage and we'll see potentially something that could even end up in certain areas to be a credit crunch or something. The FTX fallout is pretty incredible. I know Saxo offers some crypto trading opportunities. How do you look at this pretty incredible story over the last three weeks? Well, I think it's an incredibly and terrible story. Unfortunately, another one in quite a long line of unfortunate events. Again, the way we offer crypto trading in Saxo is very different. It's really linked up against the main currencies US dollar yen and euro. So we are actually having a compliant product. We don't have any cold or hot ball wallets or anything. So we offer very tight spreads. But also that means that you have best execution. You have basically a compliant product. And I think what's the problem within the crypto industry in a larger scale is the fact that all the consumer protection, all the best execution, all the perspectives knowing what you're buying and so forth. It's just not there and it's not being regulated. And we have seen not one but many fallouts FTX just being a really, really big one here. And it's kind of our we've talked about this for a long time. But it obviously needs regulation. And we need to make sure that when people are taking an unbought inclined and client funds, well, they need to also be responsible and make sure they keep the proper capital and liquidity levels. But so Kim, what does it mean specifically for a Saxobank offers? Are you cooling off crypto until there's more regulation? Does it impact the services that you will bring forward?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1475,2022-11-21 09:39:41
18862," The bank offers, are you cooling off crypto until there's more regulation? Does it impact the services that you will bring forward? Actually, the way we do it is, you know, we are fully licensed bank and we do deliver a compliant product. So we call it crypto effects. So you can trade Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum against Euro, Yen and US dollars. And that business has not had any issues. We do not have any code or hot wallets and we don't offer that for clients. So you can say that we trade cryptos in a compliant and regulated manner. And we also offer the exchange-traded products on this. So we don't really, we've not experienced any fallout from this, other than what everyone can see, which is obviously very soft markets. And again, an unfortunate situation for the whole marketplace, where global valuations have gone from three trillion to, I don't know what it is now, maybe maybe 600, 700 billion. So there's still a lot of money in there, but they're flowing out quickly. And we can see a lot of people who have lost many, many money. And that's a sad thing. Okay, first of all, congratulations on Saxo Bank. On the 30th anniversary, what happens next for Saxo Bank and how you want to grow? Will you IPO? Will you be part of the SPAC? Well, we are looking. I think my mark went down. We are looking at doing a listing. And we have announced our intent to list. So we're working hard on that as we speak. But right now it's really about running the business and trying to have a good situation there where, you know, we completed the bank migration a few weeks ago. And this has been a very, very big effort for us. So we're really focused on just working with the clients. We have a lot of additional products, platforms, services that we are rolling out across the board. And so we are working very closely with our clients and our partners. And obviously navigating difficult times, but I think Saxo is in a very good shape. And eventually we would like to be a listed company. And that is what we're pursuing full speed ahead. Even though the external circumstances are obviously not so optimal for that. But the internal one, Saxo Bank is having a good business. And I feel very good about the future after 30 years. So Kim, again, congratulations. How fast do you think you can list? And where would you list? And how much would the bank be valued at? Well, we are working on this as we speak. And that's not so much information I can provide on this at this stage. It's not going to be this year. So hopefully, beginning of next year, we'll come out with some more firm information on what all of that looks. We are aiming for Amsterdam urenex. So at least that part of it is pretty clear. But again, it's not happened since it happened. Many things can, I mean, we live in an unpredictable world. The good thing is that Saxo is a profitable business. We have very, very good capital levels. So we are very stable. We don't need to do anything. But we do believe that it will be good idea to come out with a smaller slice of the business and create a liquidity and a structure for futures shareholders. And also, we did by Bank Bank some years ago, which was successfully integrated. And to get acquisition currency to maybe do something like that again would be helpful for us as well. Kim, thank you so much, as ever, for your time and wisdom and also, unflappable. Kim Ford, a real justine is Mike, two executives there and founder of Saxo Bank. Coming up, COP27, over and out.

When I think about the metaverse, I think about immersive experiences that have a sense of actor presence. Wow, look at this. This is me. The metaverse is projected to become over a trillion dollar market by the end of this decade. And whether you know it or not, you'll probably be working there in the future. We're moving into a world where we're going to be interacting with computers with our bodies. This is definitely trippy. I think the adoption curve is going to be slow. It's weird. A real floaty thing right now. Oh, look at you. You have no legs. It's kind of a fun world and we're just at the very beginning of a very long journey. No, no, we will never know. This is Bloomberg surveillance, early edition of Frontenacqua here in London. Now the 2022 World Cup has kicked off in Qatar. A lavish opening ceremony was followed by the opening match between the hosts and Ecuador. It's a culmination of a 12 year buildup that's been marred by controversy over the initial bid human rights concerns and the environmental impact. Bloomberg's Monfaxman was watching from the stands. So, first of all, what's the opening ceremony and match say about Qatar's ability to manage this massive event? Well, as a test of Qatar's ability to manage a major sporting event, I think all went pretty well. Yes, there were quibbles. There was a lot of traffic getting to the event. Some of the food options ran out. But for the most part, there was an exciting opening ceremony, match on the field, a little less exciting. Qatar clearly outplayed really from the start. Two to nothing, Ecuador winning that match. And that likely cuts off Qatar's chances for advancing out of the group stage in the tournament. But really clear to me was who was in attendance on a geopolitical front. There were lots of regional leaders here. He saw a picture published by the Turkish state-run news agency of President Erdogan shaking hands with President Abdel Fattah, a CC of Egypt for the first time. There are massive tensions between those two countries. And then we also saw Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman. He was just two seats away from the Qatari ruler and he was in close discussions with FIFA President Gianni Infantino. And what they were talking about the potential for a Saudi world cup maybe. Maybe, certainly that would court more controversy. How are corporate sponsors responding to an event that's garnered so much public criticism to Simon? Yeah, if this one's been controversial, imagine what would happen. There was a world cup in Saudi. But look, I reached out to 76 sponsors, both of national teams based in the U.S., Canada and Europe, and also to FIFA sponsors based in those same places and places where the criticism of human rights abuses in Qatar has been widespread. And let's ask them about the rights issues themselves. Then I did, how are you responding to this? Are you changing your global marketing strategy? The vast majority said no or.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1477,2022-11-21 09:48:15
18864," The rights issues themselves, then I did, how are you responding to this? Are you changing your global marketing strategy? The vast majority said no or just plain didn't respond to me. I found just 13 teams said they were changing their strategy in order to account for human rights. And only three of those brands actually had ties in some way, business ties to Qatar. So as much as corporate CEOs go out there and they talk about ESG and social impact, you know what I found was $ add dollars, five billion viewers potentially watching the world cup. There's not much change in the way these companies say they're going about things. So I'm going to thank so much, Moon Foxman, they're joining us from Doha. Now coming up, Com 27, over and out, we'll wrap up the finale of the climate conference. That's coming up next on this evening. Saying in Italy when it comes to family generations that the first generation creates, the second generation expands and the third generation destroys. And that's almost what happened in the Gucci story. So, Hating and Love is good. Now I would have a much more experience about for those who say that love you and then they'll trade you. The Gucci family was the strength but also the weakness of the label. The situation became dire with Gucci's finances. They were not able to pay salaries, they were not able to pay suppliers. Gucci's really teetering on the brink of the stage. The top names in climate change are on Bloomberg. Building out local wind, local solar, hydrogen, these are solutions to not just climate issues but geopolitical issues. We are in position by 20, 30 to 80 percent of all electricity generated by wind.

Economic finance politics. This is Bloomberg surveillance. Early edition I'm from St. Michael here in London. The COP talks in Egypt, have ended with an agreement to help develop nations face the devastation of climate change. Although the deal for loss and damage fund paid for by rich countries, seen as a breakthrough, negotiators failed to agree further cuts in CO2 emissions. That were joined by Nasmir Amula, Chief Sustainability Officer at 91. Nasmir, thank you so much for joining us. First of all, we have heard quite a lot about G-Fans and the fact that maybe some money behind the transition.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1478,2022-11-21 09:52:40
18865," The bill is at 91. Ms. Miller, thank you so much for joining us. First of all, we have heard quite a lot about G-Fans and the fact that maybe some money behind the transition are, if not getting cold, feed wondering what the parameters of this is. Are you a bit disappointed that the move to sustainability or to greener technology and transition could have more teeth? I think it was always going to be a long journey. It was never going to be as clear as we all commit in the same year and everything moves in a straight linear line. So I think there are some disappointments from this cup, but there are also some major wins. As you noted, the loss and damage fund, the announcement on that I think is a big positive. I think also the announcements around plans to reform the global financial system, particularly around the MDVs to provide more climate financing is also a big positive. There were some areas which were not as positive, the fact that there's not as much progress around mitigation commitments, the fact that there's no agreements on peaking emissions by 2025. But I think what gives me the most hope at this point is this continued push to just build up the new technologies to get the mitigation technologies onto the ground. Ms. Miller, Republicans have also signaled that they'll use their very slim majority in the house to make it maybe more difficult or make life harder for companies embracing ESG. Is this a real threat? I think that we need to differentiate between the concerns around ESG and potentially concerns around moral values being imposed on portfolios and the idea of investing in the new green technology. I think a lot of what we've seen from the Republicans is concern around phasing out of fossil fuels, which is a big part of what needs to be done. But the part they seem to be very happy to go along with is just building the new green technology. So, the biggest boulder of renewable energy in the United States is Texas. If you look at the inflation reduction act, there may not have been a whole lot of support from the Republican Party, but there are many Republican states that are going to take massive advantage of the benefits of that act. But do you see any of this actually affecting the flow of capital, potentially, away from some of the ESG goals? I think that's something that we'll have to monitor as it goes along. I mean, I think as far as COP goes, as far as COP27, I think the focus on mitigation has been clear. We saw that with the Indonesia transaction, if you look at South Africa last year, was much more combination of the shutdown of old coal-fired power stations and building the new energy. Indonesia is much more around how quickly they can build new renewable energy. And I think that's where the focus is increasing and shifting at this point. Ms. Mara, overall, what kind of adjustments are you making to your allocations to reflect some of the developments at COP27? I know there were slim, but there's a couple of things that happened and were signed off on. I think one of the things we saw at COP is this continued rhetoric around the need to fund the emerging market transition. What worries me a little bit is you haven't seen capital flow in anywhere near the quantum needed for that. So we know that portfolio flows into emerging markets have been challenged because of the macro, but the blended finance flows are also done. So the latest report from Convergence shows blended finance flows into emerging markets, particularly around climate, but in general, are done if you take the last three years compared to the previous three years. And that's exactly the opposite of what we need. Now, we talk about these jet peas and, yes, they're important and they're catalytic, but we aren't seeing substantial amounts of really concessional capital coming to bears yet. I'm hopeful we may see more, but it hasn't happened as yet. So what I'm doing is we are looking at allocating towards the companies and countries that are doing the most to transition because a large part of that transition can be done by the commercial private sector. And that's what we need to support. Great. So much. And as Miramula, their chief sustainability officer at 91.

It's one of the biggest floating solar plants in the world. Floating solar rays have been gaining traction in Asia, including countries like Singapore and Thailand. Floating projects typically benefit from an easier connection to the power grid. They can also restrict algae blooms while keeping the solar panels cool. This one in particular has healthy local economy. When the power plant was first proposed, residents were given the chance to invest. Some locals were also offered jobs during construction. In fact, it was the community that requested the panels to be shaped as flowers to look more appealing. South Korea has to rely heavily on imported fossil fuels, but will need to change that to reach its goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2050.

It's 10 a.m. in London, 5 a.m. in New York, and 6 p.m. in Hong Kong are top stories today. Disney's surprise, Bob Iger is back as CEO, after a string of disappointing results and a slumping share price. Far from zero, China's first COVID-related deaths in almost six months has sparked concern that Beijing could see a return to heightened restrictions. And $3.1 billion, that's how much FTX owes its 50 biggest unsecured creditors. We've got the latest on the ongoing crypto crisis. Welcome to Bloomberg Surveillance, early edition, I'm Anna Edwards in London with Matt Miller and Kaley Lines in New York. Morning to you, Kaley, Antomat. And Kaley, it seems another week. And we've turned a bit of a corner on the China story, now worrying about the reaction function we're going to see from Chinese authorities, whether it'll be the old COVID-zero playbook, as cases rise. Yeah, Anna, it's definitely an abrupt U-turn on what had been optimism about the reopening of the Chinese economy. We've seen a massive rally in Chinese sensitive stocks as a result, but now concerned back to the forefront that tighter curves could go into place after those reported deaths over the weekend. So that drags heavily on risk sentiment in Asia overnight. The Hong saying China enterprise index down about 2% and the losses were even greater for technology stocks in particular, which had seen really big gains over the last several weeks. The Hong saying tech index down about 3%. And of course, filtering through to other asset classes as well and foreign exchange to Chinese you on a weaker against the US dollar by about 6, 7, 10% of 1%, 17, 17, or 7, 17 rather is where we trade. And of course, there is a read through to the commodity complex given so many of these are very sensitive to the China demand story. Iron ore specifically with those futures down about 3.5% overnight to around $95 a ton, Matt. All right, and we're watching, of course, the yen weakening against the dollar as well right now. Dollar strengthening against a number of other currencies. Here you can see in the second row the Bloomberg US dollar index now up to 12.91, back up to 12.91. So climbing ever higher on concerns about the COVID crackdown in China, we're going to have a look at the current of the about face that we saw there and we're going to talk about that in a little bit. S&P futures down on that as well right now about half a percent. We were up about half a percent of the cash trade of the S&P on Friday to about 39.65. We're losing a little bit of that steam right now. 9X crude is also coming down. If there is a continued slowdown in China, we don't have that reversal that may have been a little bit of a lift for prices. We're going to have a little bit of a low down below $70, a below $80 share at $79.71 on West Texas Intermediate. Finally Bitcoin right now trading just above $16,000, $16,093. It had fallen below that and I'm sure that's going to affect a lot of companies like Riot Blockchain and Coinbase in today's trade. But we're definitely watching the $16,000 level which had been until now a support. Anna, what do you see in Europe? Well, here in Europe then Matt, we've seen four weeks of decent gains across European equity markets. Have we drawn a line under that though? Are we now in a consolidation phase? Are we done with the rally into the year end? Still in November of course. But this is what we've got with European stocks right now. Just down by one tenth of a percent on the FTSE 100, the CACA are on a bit more than that. The DAX down around half a percent. We are off earlier lows of the session. So we were down weaker than this little bit earlier on in the day. Barkley is talking about 2023. Being a better year for European stocks, saying by the end of the year, at least we will have worked through some of the headwinds. That seems a very long way off right now, doesn't it? This is what we're dealing with here in Europe right now. And the FX moves have been big overnight. And Kalea and Matt have talked about some of those. So let's get to what that's doing to European assets. Maybe the pain of that strength of the dollar has been one that US corporates have been feeling. Some European companies feeling it as well of course. And we've got the pound here down by seven tenths of one percent against the US dollar. As we see a return to that strong dollar vibe, the euro also down by nine tenths of a percent. So this really is a strong dollar story, not weakness in these particular particular currencies today. And the strong dollar being driven, of course, by what Kalea was talking about over in China and the fight against COVID that continues there. Brent crude down by six cents of one percent. Matt had the WG.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1481,2022-11-21 10:05:45

Brent crude down by 6 cents of 1% Matt had the WTI price. We're down well below $90. The barrel had we seen support coming through from an expectation of a pivot in the way that China deals with COVID. We've seen that Goldman Sachs has reduced its call on where energy goes from here and bringing down its oil price call by around $10. Julius Bear Group up by 6 cents of 1%. So outperforming the broader space, we heard from them in terms of numbers reporting to the markets today. The money manager based in Switzerland in line with expectations really as far as its targets are concerned, not changing those, but saying it sees better things in terms of the net new money that owe the new money coming into the business now. All right, very interesting stuff. We're going to continue paying very close attention to that as we do all of the wealth management stories across around the world. A lot of those wealth managers own Disney and had been disappointed with the CEO Bob Chepek. Well, now Disney is bringing back its former CEO Bob Eiger to run the company, which is a surprise moved by the board after a string of disappointing results by Chepek. Eiger stepped down as chief executive in 2020 after leading the company through a period of enormous growth over 15 years. Alex Webb of Bloomberg Quick Take joins us now for more. So this was unexpected and we got a new activist shareholder or an activist shareholder building up a bigger stake as well, right? The thing we'd seen over the course of the pandemic was that early on we had activists come in and say that Disney needs to be more like Netflix. I become a growth stock, cut the dividend, invest the capital in content for the streaming service Disney plus. At that stage Disney had been trading around the 20s something times forward earnings. Netflix was 50 plus times forward earnings. Disney subsequently overtook Netflix on that basis. But what we've seen since then is that growth stocks have been punishes interest rates of increase. So the question that Eiger now faces is will he do better to take more money away from Disney plus and increase the dividend or should he still try to position Disney as a growth stock at a time when it isn't particularly rosy for those kind of equities? Yeah, good morning to Alex here. As money becomes more expensive, more expensive to do new things and to invest in new stuff and in growth. So what can Disney change then from here? Well, it can take money away from Disney plus and decide to increase the dividend. There is some internal cultural things. There's a lot of basically communication with capital markets that perhaps needs to improve. What is the purpose of the spending? What is it going to yield over what sort of time frame? Now, at this stage, people are not looking as much for stocks that have longer returns. They want stuff that's more immediate. And so that might be the first thing I can need to look at. All right, Disney shares up 8.5 percent right now in pre-market trading. Bloomberg Quick Takes Alex Web. Thank you so much. Let's turn back now to the China's story. The country's first COVID related deaths in almost six months are sparking concern that Beijing could see a return of tighter curves and occur in our chief Asia economics correspondent joins us now from Hong Kong with more. So, and how realistic is it that we see a reopening of this economy if deaths might be on the rise? Well, it's going to be a big test of this recent COVID-zero pivot, Danny. As you mentioned, cases are surging now. We've had those first fatalities since in six months. We're heading into winter time. Officials are obviously at a very delicate stage because in the one hand, of course, we had a signalling from the top of government that it could be some more targeted kind of restrictions to slow down the pace of COVID spreading rather than the blanket lockdowns we've seen in the past. Less mass testing, less kind of lockdowns. We have seen now already summer versus of some of that city near Beijing, for example, our colleagues are porting quite widespread restrictions in place there, even though they had been easing as a city themselves in recent weeks. So, it is a big test. Remember, it's a lot in the line politically. China has made a big deal out of their overall fatality rate being so low compared to other parts of world, especially the US. But, of course, we now know there's so much pressure on the economy, both from the real estate and the COVID-zero lockdowns, that there will be a lot of pressure under government in terms of how we do handle this. And I think we're heading into, we're having a government handles it. And we are obviously heading into a very critical period over the coming weeks as we go deeper into winter. Yes. And as far as the market and the economic fallout from this is concerned, of course, last couple of weeks have been dominated by markets rethinking China and thinking there was going to be a pivot away from the really harsh COVID-zero policies towards the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1482,2022-11-21 10:10:03
18869," was going to be a pivot away from the really harsh COVID-19 policies towards something. Lucer, that that would pay dividends for the Chinese economy. Some of that prize just gets pushed into the future, I suppose. Well, it does, but the state press this morning in terms of conflicting signals and at a state press this morning we're saying, look, let's not go back to those blanket kind of lockdowns or restrictions that China has become known for early and the pandemic, tried to do something more targeted. But obviously officials on the ground must be wondering how can they figure that out how can they control cases without reverting to these big broad-based lockdowns. And this is where the market story comes in. There has been optimism that when China does pivot away from COVID-19, the economy recovers and you're back to investing in the China story. But it must be said right now, China remains to have in place some of the world's most strictest measures to control COVID and does feel like we remain sometime away from a fully completed exit from the COVID-19 strategy. And thanks very much Bloomberg's enter current coming to us from Hong Kong. Let's get now the latest on the crypto situation. New court papers show Sam Bankman, Fried's, Bankrupt, Empire owes its 50 biggest, unsecured creditors customers that is as total of $3.1 billion. Anna, there had a Bloomberg senior crypto editor joins us for more. So Anna, two of those customers had more than $200 million on FTX's books. Yeah, so we're trying, obviously, everyone I guess is trying to figure out who these creditors might be because there might be ripple effects, right? Like they might have the creditors too. So, you know, this is clearly a sign that there might be some more contagion coming. There might be some more contagion coming. What do you make of the fact that Bitcoin dropped below 16,000? I mean, on one level, there's been a slow and steady drop on another. It seems fairly controlled compared to the rest of the chaos that we're seeing in crypto. Yeah, it's quite interesting. It seems maybe that people are distinguishing between crypto, the people and the companies and crypto the asset and maybe you would have imagined it would have dropped to like maybe 10,000 if we imagined a chaos of similar proportions. Okay, more analysis on crypto later in the program. Let us thank you then to Bloomberg's Anna Irreira. Let us get back to another story we're following today. Negotiators at the UN COP27 climate summit have reached an historic last minute deal on payments for climate damages. Let's get to Bloomberg's Jennifer Saba Saja, who joins us now from Sharnel's Shake. So, Jen, what has been agreed? The manager agrees something, around the amount of support to poorer countries, but not around increasing targets for emission reduction. Exactly, Anna. And this was a win significantly for a lot of developing nations who have said for 30 years plus that they wanted Lawson Jenda on the agenda item. So, this was significant that a fund was actually created out of this summit. And what it will do is sort of the next step for the transitional committee that is going to be formed leading into COP28. Right now, we don't know the financing structure. We don't know which countries are part of it. So, still a lot of work to go on that. But when just talking about the failures, the disappointments that people are feeling out of this COP, it was really on this front with mitigation. There was not stronger language taken from COP26 in Glasgow this year. There was not a decision to include the determined phase out all fossil fuels and just phasing down like what we saw last year. So, a lot of disappointment from a number of leaders who were hoping that would get us on a better path to keeping temperatures below that 1.5 degrees Celsius. But there were still some positives coming out of it. There was a number of climate finance projects that were announced by the private sector. Also, some public sector support for countries like Vietnam and Indonesia to transition out of fossil fuels. So, some positives and a lot of negatives, but a lot of mixed results coming out of this COP27. And really a lot to still work out going into COP28 that is going to be hosted in the UAE, which is of course a major oil and gas producer. So, many climate scientists and activists are worried that maybe this goal that we had had is maybe diminishing just leading into the next year. All right. Bloomberg, Jennifer Zabisadja reporting from Sharma, Shake, Egypt. Thank you so much. Now, let's get back to the markets and take a look at some stocks moving in pre-market trading here in the US.

Alibaba down 3% for those ADRS JD.com down nearly 5%. And it is also weighing on casino operators that have heavy revenue exposure to Macau, Las Vegas, Sands, win resorts, each under pressure down between 3 and 3% for those who are in the US. So that is weighing on the shares of another crypto exchange. Coinbase, of course, the largest one that is public. Those shares down about 5% before the bell. Coming up on the program, we will get back to the subjects of energy, very topical hearing in Europe and business. One of one's governments at this point. Great Jackson joins us, founder and CEO of Octopus Energy and the US. We will also talk about markets with Jeffery U, BNY, Melon, senior strategist. What is he making for the big pivot back into the dollar this morning that we are seeing around those China headlines. Plus, on crypto, we will get back to that story. Lex Sockle joins us, consensus, head economist, will get his perspective on the latest FTX news lines. This is the latest FTX news line. The FTX news line is a very big pivot back into the dollar. Lex Sockle joins us, founder and CEO of Octopus Energy and the US. We will get back to that story. Lex Sockle joins us, founder and CEO of Octopus Energy and the US. We will get back to that story. Lex Sockle joins us, founder and CEO of Octopus Energy. Hello, somebody is watching and says I want to be Aremani when I grow up. What should somebody do to get into the talent agency business or business you're in. Well its hopefully what I've taught my kids. You've got to be intellectually curious. You got to show up and you know like I know it. I got on a lot of planes. You just yeah even though that voice in your head is saying oh god I'm so tired I don't want to do this. You got to show up. You got to be charmingly relentless. You have to build emotional endurance because there's no straight line of success at the kind of all over place and you have to just be able to work through those things. And then I think one of the things that I do every week is I try to create serendipity. Lots happening on Wall Street. I'm quite encouraged. The center is holding. Need to catch up. This is Bluebird Wall Street Week. I'm David Weston. We've got the information and insight. A lot of these areas still have very very good valuations. From businesses most influential and instrumental. It's knocking it out the ball. It's not a great time to be speculative. It's time for a pivot. We're trying to buy a significant hit to a standard of living. Bluebird Wall Street Week live tonight with Replays All Weekend on Bluebird Television and Radio. This is Bluebird's surveillance. I'm Anna Edwards in London with Matt Miller and Kaley Lines in New York. The UK Prime Minister Rishi Soonak is set to speak to business representatives at the UK's largest business conference today. In fact, within the next 15 minutes also, surging energy prices are among the topics on the agenda. One of the keynote speakers at the conference. Great Jackson joins us. When we look at the government and its relationships of business right now, clearly your business is impacted by the budget last week. What are you looking to hear from the Prime Minister when he speaks a little bit later today? I'm clearly in the short term. It's important that we do everything we can to help consumers through this crisis. The impact on inflation, on their spending power and critically on their ability just to pay their bills is foremost in the short term. But we also.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1484,2022-11-21 10:19:01
18871," The impacts on inflation, on their spending power, and critically on their ability just to pay their bills is foremost in the short term. But we also have to build our way out of this. And the answer is, being able to deploy, you know, dramatically more chemical to build a cheap renewable energy here in the UK. And then this is what we need around the world. It's not only going to help tackle climate change. You heard from COP just now and the critical importance now getting on with replacing fossil fuels with renewables, but also it helps energy costs and energy security. Right. And with that in mind, you talk about needing to build our way out cheap renewable energy. The government has just put a 45% tax on businesses like yours through the electricity generator levy. Where does that leave your investment plans? Yeah, I mean, at the moment, it's very hard for any company to justify the windfall profits that far exceed anything it was planned. When at the same time, you're seeing the damage done to consumers lives and to our economy coming with a fair solution to important. And these kind of sticking past the solutions are okay. What matters is giving the ability to deploy dramatically more investment to grow forward. And at the moment, you know, in the UK and around the world, we face sclerotic grid infrastructure, which means we can't get these new renewable built and connected. We're trying to find an issue that are on necessary. We've got to learn from COVID where, you know, we took 15 year regulatory regulatory process of the vaccine did it in a year. We've got to take the seven or eight year regulatory process to renewable building and do it at the time of the end of the year, which is the year. Greg, I keep reading that at least from an investor's perspective, the UK and the European energy situation isn't as bad as had been expected. What's the worst case scenario for now? We're right in the middle of the storm at the moment. I think what's happened is Europe responded quickly to the needs to start reducing depends on rushing gas, you know, filling up a gas storage in Germany across Europe rapidly building new supply chains to get gas into Europe to replace that Russian gas. We've had a mild start to the winter in the Northern hemisphere. And so so far, the crisis this year is like, you know, prices are still actually higher than they were in the past. But, you know, we can be slightly more positive. What we don't know is what the rest of the wind holds. So what really matters now is, are we going to be able to, you know, leave this winter with some gas and storage ready for next year? Or is bad weather they're going to hit and then we're going to be scrambling for more gas? Are households prepared? I mean, could we have made should we be making more preventative taking more preventative measures such as insulation? In the first thing is there are lots of low hanging fruit that households can do. Whether that be, you know, for a lot of households, they can reduce their thermostat by one degree C. They all reduce consumption 10, 15% very often. And barely make a difference to comfort. Other households can adjust the way that they're, for example, gas furnace, the gas boilers works. And again, saving another five 10% of gas. All to put this customers in October, you 37% less gas last year. That's a combination of warm weather, but also a lot of behavioral change. What we don't know is how long that lasts through the winter. Yeah, so interesting to see kind of those demand reductions. Meanwhile, Greg Octopus is in the process of acquiring bull, which is another UK energy provider that collapsed as prices soared. The government had not hedged for those customers. So how did they make that deal attractive to you? Yeah, so I think, like, first of all, I can't talk a lot about conversation where having with government, it's going through a technical legal process at the moment. But I think government rules in the UK prevent hedging. And this winter that certainly cost the government a lot of money. And the sooner that they can find the roots to playing ball back into the private sector, the sooner they can get certainty to taxpayers. Okay, and finally, bull obviously is not the first that has succumbed to this very volatile energy price environment. It may not be the last. Do you expect we will see more providers going bust over the course of this winter, possibly the next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1485,2022-11-21 10:23:02
18872," We have a little energy price environment. It may not be the last. Do you expect we will see more providers going bust over the course of this winter, possibly the next? Last winter, there would do monger saying that we'd end last winter with less than 10 energy privates. There's still well over 20. So, you know, I think it's a fool that makes those predictions. But the key thing here is pretty much every company that went bust did so because they were not hedged. We need to regulate when the government's made sure companies are hedged. It's the current and financial services of, you know, selling long and buying short. And without a decent regulation oversight, you know, you're always going to have vulnerability. So, the one thing we're calling on is regulatory focus on hedging. And that would secure the sector dramatically better than before. All right. Greg Jackson of Octopus Energy. Thank you so much for your time today. And again, we are watching four remarks from CBI from the UK Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, will bring you any headlines from that when it begins. Meanwhile, let's keep you up to date with other news from around the world with the first word. In a newspaper interview, Germany's defense minister says the country is offering patriot missile defense systems to Poland. Last week, a strike killed two people in a Polish village near the Ukrainian border. Germany says it also intends to extend a deployment of patriot batteries in Slovakia through 2023. The UN's atomic agency says powerful blast shook the area of Ukraine's Zarbiritia nuclear plant over the weekend. Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers warned U.S. policymakers to focus on building the country's own economic strengths in its contest with China, rather than attacking its adversary. Summers tells Bloomberg the U.S. should instead concentrate on its own innovation, infrastructure education, and challenges such as opioid deaths. The world's biggest single sporting event, soccer's World Cup, has begun in Qatar with a lavish opening ceremony. The Gulf state's been under intense scrutiny leading up to the tournament over the treatment of migrant workers who built seven new stadiums as well as concerns about human rights and its criminalization of homosexuality. And it wasn't the start the hosts were hoping for on the pitch either, beaten to nothing by Ecuador in the opening match. And American musician Ye, of course formerly Kanye West, returns to Twitter after a two week hiatus from the social network and the new owner Elon Musk welcomed him back to the platform. Ye's account had been temporarily suspended and restored at the end of October, which Musk said was not his decision. Ye's earlier suspension had been due to an anti-Semitic tweet. And of course it's not just Ye that has made his return to Twitter or at least could in theory former U.S. President Donald Trump, who had been banned from the platform in January of 2021, also has had his account restored. But I just checked that he has not yet tweeted. Of course he tends to stray toward true social these days. But the question is, is that going to be enough reach for him? Does he need to go back to Twitter? Elon Musk had tweeted a pretty cool meme with Lois from Family Guy like shaking and looking at a prescription drug bottle like she needs those drugs. Does Trump need Twitter? Maybe he will if enough people aren't reading him on true social. Certainly he's not getting swing voters that way, Anna. Yeah, I mean some of the memes that Musk was facing funny, some of them seem to pretty bad taste. But interesting to see the poll that he conducted around President Trump, Ben Kayley. And the fact that he said he was going to set up a board to evaluate this kind of stuff. And then he just decided to decide via asking his followers. And would you believe it? The result was 4852. That seems to be the kind of divide we get in all kinds of political situations these days. Yeah, definitely a split, Anna. But on the point of Elon Musk's decisions, it is interesting to see him restoring accounts that frankly were deactivated for a reason because of concern around the spread of false misinformation and also anti-Semitic and other hateful content. When Twitter already is contending with advertisers pulling back from the platform because they're uncertain around the company under the leadership of Elon Musk, concerned that perhaps their advertisements will be running next to misinformation or hateful content. It raises a question of the business decision of restoring some of these accounts. And if this is just going to push people further off the platform. Yep, it's going to have an interesting impact on that ad revenue. We'll watch that very carefully. Back in the markets then we'll talk to Jeffrey Eunex, BNY Melon, senior strategist. We're seeing money flooding back into the dollars as a, all those headlines around China of course making a...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1486,2022-11-21 10:27:26
18873," We will watch that carefully. Back in the markets, we will talk to Jeffrey Eunex, BNY Melon, senior strategist. We are seeing money flooding back into the dollars as a, all those headlines around China are making investors very nervous about what the reaction function is of the Chinese government around Covid. Yes, cases are rising, sadly, death rising too. What kind of lockdown strategies will we see? They look like the old playbook that we have known through Covid-0 from the Chinese government. We will get back to that conversation shortly. And what does that mean for investment strategies more broadly and globally? This is Blinkberg. We have invested more than $10 million in our employees over the past year and we are going to continue to invest more. We are testing four day work weeks to help especially our working parents kind of juggle that balance between childcare and their work. I know I deal with that all the time. This is really a people first company. In an inflationary environment, you are going to see us continue to lead with our people. Do you worry at all of that price wage spiral, not just here, but in the industry, in the economy? Yes, and I think that this is something that many business leaders are focused on and time will tell kind of how all of this lands. I think the wage-price spiral continues for quite some time and I think we probably have been a lot less aggressive than we can be and that many other companies have been. In terms of raising crisis, we've taken our time. If you look at a 20-year history of pricing in this company, we've taken about 2% a year on average. We've never taken what we could, we've always taken what we should. We have to pay people more. We have been and will continue to do so. We'll take a little bit of a margin compression on that as we've had to and I think that's the right thing so that for the long term, Shake-Chack continues to be what we're building which is the next generation's burger joint. The multi-trillion dollar industry, there's a lot of ground to cover. Come on, these got absolutely crushed. We'll show you what's happening in ETFs like No one else, Bloomberg ETF RQ Monday on Bloomberg. Every Friday with 30 minutes dedicated to fixed income, I'm Jonathan Farrow this is Bloomberg Real Yield. This is Bloomberg's available in early edition. Here's what you need to know. Disney's surprise, Bob Iger is back at CEO after a string of disappointing results and a slumping share price. Far from zero, China's first COVID-related deaths in almost six months of spark concern that Beijing could see a return of heightened restrictions. And $3.1 billion, that's how much FTXOs is 50 biggest unsecured creditors. We've got the latest on the ongoing crypto crisis. I'm Anna Edwards in London with Matt Nile and Kayley Lines in New York. Matt, the crypto story, the Twitter story, plenty of individual business stories and indeed stories that risk contagion to follow. But in terms of the broader markets, we've got this Chinese",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1487,2022-11-21 10:31:46
18874," the Twitter story, plenty of individual business stories and indeed stories that risk contagion to follow. But in terms of the broader markets, we've got this Chinese story coming through and having a bit of a downward impact on US features, at least something is pushing them lower. Yeah, the Chinese story is huge, right? Because it turns around a lot of the narratives that started to look like they were driving the market. For example, we thought, okay, there are a lot of short positions now in the US dollar. The green back is going to start to weaken against other currencies around the world. Now we're seeing the US dollar and it's the Bloomberg US dollar index here in the second row strengthen against other currencies around the world. You may also have thought, okay, if they start to unlock big cities in China, a ton of people are going to be driving, there's going to be huge gas demand. We can expect oil to start to bounce back higher as demand comes back in the picture. Well, oil is now back lower. Again under $80 a barrel for this is West Texas and immediate and I'm X-True, but you can see the same thing on the global benchmark Brent. We're coming down on concerns that that demand just isn't going to be there regardless of the supply cuts that OPEC puts into force. All of this of course is pressuring S&P futures in a downward manager as well as other indexes around the world. Right now we're at 39.51 on futures. We're at 39.56 I think on the cash trade, we were up about half percent on Friday, but that's now turned back around. Then Bitcoin also looking at some downward pressure, but still higher than 16,000. We had dipped below 16,000 temporarily that is seen as a support level for the cryptocurrency, but it's now back up there. The question is, will this contagion spreading out from FKX, all the customers that were owned owed $200,150,000,000 and looking to put a big zero under that, is that going to hurt across? I think that someone put it earlier, are those creditors going to have creditors of their own? Kelly, what do you see in terms of pre-market effects? Well, I have to begin first with one of the shock corporate stories of the day and that is Disney. A surprise ouster, a Bob Chepac, the CEO, the prior CEO, Bob Eiger, who stepped down in 2020 after leading the company for 15 years is back in. He will be CEO for another two years while they search for a permanent replacement. He's going to be charged with turning things around for Disney stock, which is down more than 40% so far in 2022, but it is higher by 8.2% on that surprise news of the morning massive move for Disney. But back to the crypto story you were mentioning, Matt, the kind of ripple effects contagion concern around FTX and the fact that Bitcoin prices are lower. That's dragging on really the entire crypto complex, including Coinbase, of course, a rival exchange, which is down 5.2%. And then for the China story that you and Anna were mentioning off the top, they're concerned that the reopening of the economy maybe is not actually going to be coming so soon as cases rise and the first deaths in the country were reported in six months over at the weekend. So JD.com, down 5%, Alibaba ADRs, down about 3% as well, Anna. Katie, here in the European session, then I just wanted to show you the European side of some of the big macro themes that Matt was talking about a moment ago. So we've got the European stocks on the back, but down by two tenths of one percent, just as we see US features a little bit weaker, the big global story coming out of China, it seems to dominate. That pushes money into the dollar that perceives safe haven of the green bag, and that takes out the pound and the euro, both the pound and the euro, then down around 8 tenths, 9 tenths of a percent against the US dollar. That's quite a substantial move in one session for those currencies. And Brent Crude, Matt, was talking about WTI, he's Brented down by 6 tenths of a percent. Again, this is related to China concerns about the growth story there, and how long we have to wait for any kind of normalization in the growth story out of China. Galburn, Sachs, for example, Kaylee, taking down their estimate of where oil prices get to by around $10. Yeah, really seeing across asset classes, the concern reflected about growth in the Chinese economy, but it raises the question of whether good news is bad news, bad news is good news because a reopen to China and spur demand from China could fuel the inflation problem that countries around the world are dealing with. So let's get the assessment now from Jeff, you B&Y Melon, senior market strategist who is joining us from London. Jeff, how are you viewing the China story going into 2023 as we have optimism on the one hand about reopening? Question marks if that's even going to happen and ultimately what it all means for inflation. Good morning. So I think the overall census maybe market's got a bit ahead of themselves in anticipating some kind of a big bang reopening. I think globally we've noted in the past and we've seen through experience so that a big bang reopening in the middle of winter and winter is a northern China can get.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1488,2022-11-21 10:36:08
18875," It solves an anticipating some kind of a big bang reopening. I think globally we've noted in the past and we've seen through experience that a big bang reopening in the middle of winter and winters in Northern China can get very, very cold. You know, it's quite adverse in environment for a reopening. That was always a bit of a stretch. However, you know, right now what I'm watching is whether Beijing and some other cities and at risk right now, they're willing to sort of experiment a bit. Now, there has been a gradual symbolic, you know, to note of that changes, you know, in a more precise way of managing COVID. You know, they're being a bit more transparent, I guess, about in a death-sapning. Maybe this is preparing the groundwork for some tough times to come. People are being told, you know, to stay at home rather than or to stay at home at least according to official communicates. So this is going to be a stop start. But a full scale, let's say, pick up activity. We're still looking at maybe Q2 next year at the earliest. And when that pick up and activity comes, does that equate to a higher terminal rate, Jeff? Well, it really depends who you're going to ask. Because there probably will be upside surprises to, let's say, services, demand and industrial demand in the eurozone. So about to pick between the ECB and the Fed, you know, who needs to revise their terminal views. So from China's reopening, it certainly is probably more to the ECB side. And also, of course, in Asia, that's where you really can revise upwards your terminal rate views. And also allows them currency appreciation, right? We're seeing that in the yen. Maybe some more interesting, the same dollar, for example. So different implications for different economies. And different implications for different assets, Jeff, good to speak to you. What about oil prices down here at 87? I say down because you really, really, really, really, really, much higher prices. 87.07 is where we are on Brent. So once again, below $90, Goldman Sachs taking down their full cast for where oil prices get to you. Are different asset classes telling us different things about the global economy? I really think it does. And also, if you look at oil prices, you know, what's the relationship between oil prices and the dollar, right? So oil prices, you know, just going down normally, we'd see, well, if it's dollar strength, right? So it tends to depress commodity prices in general. But right now, I think it's more of a demand story because we're seeing dollar weaken, you know, largely due to positioning and evaluation issues. And that's only good for commodity prices. But the struggling right now, I think that's due to the demand story as well. Again, you know, next year, if China reappears, I do think there's going to be a sting in the tail for prices for commodities, maybe less on the all side, at the front, the industrial side, I think that's something we need to watch out for. Okay, commodities will watch that carefully. Back to the dollar. The dollar actually gaining in today's session, as we've mentioned, because of risk conversion, but do you then generally see, well, if the dollar has topped out, Jeff, what does it top out again? What would be better opportunities in FX right now? Well, right now, for example, in G10, we're looking at Euro dollar, we're looking at, you know, dollar yen, for example, yen positioning and evaluations, you know, that's something really to look at. Euro, you know, right now, we've three months ago, according to our custody flow days, we're an eye flow. We saw Euro holdings reach almost financial crisis and sovereign debt crisis lows. At that point, so we're not too positive on the Euro either, but that was extremes. But now we're seeing Euro suddenly flatten out. This is one of the strongest recoveries we've seen. So yes, valuations and policy crucially quite supportive, but have had to pick between those two and probably favor the yen strength and against the dollar, rather than the Euro at this point. So if valuations are getting better, where are you finding the best bargains, Jeff, are there certain sectors that you like, are there certain regions that you like better than others? Well, again, just going back to our flow data, right now, equities are still being sold across the board. Two sectors, you know, worth watching right now. Firstly, if it's still stagnation, you want to own sectors, so defensive sectors with pricing power. And I think that's where utilities and have come through. And even in the lead-up, we were still quite risk off and seeing, right before that downside, CPI, surprise in the US, utilities, basically, globally, the only sectors where which was in demand. But now, of sectors, especially in the consumer side, exposed to China reopening, this could be in Europe and this could be an APAC as well. That's where we're seeing a pick-up in interest. And people looking at financials as well, if China reflates, if Chinese curve steepens, that could help in APAC financials in general. That may be getting a bit too ahead of ourselves right now, but we'll stick to APAC and consumer and also utilities for the time being globally. What about fixed income, Jeff? I mean, have returns gotten big enough of yields gotten big enough for you to think it's time to go back? Or is that period already passed? I still think we need to be cautious on the corporate space. If I look at corporate credit spreads, have they really blown out in a pricing and potential a recessionary driven rise in bankruptcies and globally, especially in Europe at this point? I think that's something we need to be quite cautious on. The repayments for Nataltro's.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1489,2022-11-21 10:40:33
18876," especially in Europe at this point, I think that's something we need to be quite cautious on. The repayments for Tiltrose last week, what impact is that going to have them overall liquidity in terms of funding, the credit in the eurozone, that's something still quite concerned about. However, if we go back to APAC, especially in the property sector for credit, that's something that clients are looking at quite aggressively because of the widening that we've seen and with the support announced in the bi-begin property, maybe we've seen enough widening and corporate credit in property in APAC, but is it really a slam dunk trade time to get back? I think we need for the reopening stories to actually gather some legs first. Jeffrey, thanks very much. Thanks for joining us. Jeffrey, you of B&Y, Melon joining us here on set in London. Coming up on the break, we'll get back to the fallout from FTX. We'll be joined by Lex Socklin, who's head economist at blockchain technology company Consensus. I'm actually trying to draw a line between FTX and, well, all they are, there's all the rest. Let's talk about that next. This is Blinkback. You did not get stronger that moment that you're lifting the barbell. You get stronger as your body is making repairs, making recovery. Recovery is a win and how you get fit or faster stronger. Recovery technology includes everything from massage guns and foam rollers to compression boots, hyperbaric chambers, cryo chambers, infrared sonas, and even infrared pajamas. And athletes are partnering to become investors to take those products mainstream. When you look at tech and sports right now, it's completely innovating the way training's going, completely changing the way recovery's going. I think sky's the limit as far as where it can go. But while some of these products can feel amazing, it can be difficult to differentiate between what really helps the body and what just tricks the mind. Every time you're chasing the latest, greatest, newest tool, you're probably chasing a mirage. The top names in climate change are on Bloomberg. Building out local wind, local solar, hydrogen, these are solutions to not just climate issues but geopolitical issues. We are in a position by 20, 30 to 80 percent of all electricity generated by wind. The global's are the safest, the cleanest and the cheapest form of energy today, especially for countries such as Greece. Recovery's climate change like Bloomberg, your global business authority. This is Bloomberg's surveillance early edition on Matt Miller, O'Kalele, lines here in New York and Edwards with us out of London. Now, crypto prices are falling as more details about the downfall of Sandbankman, Fried's FTX Empire come to light. New court papers show the company owes its 50 biggest, unsecured creditors is a total of $3.1 billion. Joining us now to talk more about this whole issue, the industry and the underlying assets, Lex Sokolin, he's head economist, I should say, at consensus. Lex, thanks so much for your time. I want to start with the idea that this is all very bad for Bitcoin or for cryptocurrencies. When it really seems to me to be an organizational problem, it's a problem with centralized finance, more than it is the underlying assets. What do you think about the differentiation? Yeah, absolutely. Thank you so much for having me. I think it's really important to draw this line, this line between the economic activity and the entrepreneurship and the building that's happening on crypto rails that people talk about as Web 3. And then on the other side.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1490,2022-11-21 10:44:41
18877," between the economic activity and the entrepreneurship and the building that's happening on crypto rails that people talk about as Web 3. And then on the other side, the financial industry that has formed around Web 3. And in many ways is supportive of that. And it can start out as very symbiotic, but it can also turn parasitic. And in that way, damage the actual entrepreneurship and growth of the underlying technology of the underlying economy. And so what we've seen as a large failure for about the last nine months in FTX, in Voyager, in Celsius, in three-Aros Capital, and then going back to Terra is we've seen a failure of the financial services industry around crypto. And that looks like a liquidity crisis and a liquidation cascade. It looks the same way as Lehman Brothers in relation to housing or long-term capital management in relation to fixed income. And of course, it's extremely damaging, but it is not reflective of the underlying economy that's being built in crypto. I mean the thing about Lehman Brothers and LTCM, they didn't shake investors' confidence in the dollar, right? Is this enough to shake investor confidence in Bitcoin? When, you know, ultimately, there isn't much else aside from confidence holding that currency higher. I think there's quite a bit of a discussion we could have on the use cases and the fundamentals of blockchains and in particular computational blockchains. But if you think about the housing crisis and the Lehman collapse, after that, people still bought houses and they lived in them because they need a place to actually live in. And in the internet, in the internet, boom and bust, after all of the financing and the venture investing and all of those companies won belly up in the early 2000s, it's not like the internet went away. We had more internet companies, more value created. And similarly, the crypto movement and crypto infrastructure, and in particular, the building of software on crypto infrastructure, you know, it's a separate theme from how much we can get levered up in derivatives around crypto assets. So I think that the use cases remain. They're getting more adopted. There's more users on all of the chains. But at the same time, any financial crisis is going to be quite painful. Okay. It could point to you, Lex. I mean, maybe you see this as old finance and therefore, you know, you're not very interested in the views here. But Neil Kashkari, you know, if the Fed has a very different view on this, the team is tweeting at the end of last week that this isn't the case of one fraudulent company in a serious industry. He says the entire notion of crypto is nonsense. It's not useful for payments. No inflation hedge, no scarcity, maybe debate that, no taxing authority, just the tool of speculation and greater falls. You still come up against that kind of view. Yeah, it's unfortunate that we have these types of views still out there. I think if you engage with... A lot of people think that. It's not just him. I understand that it's very tempting to use a broad brush, especially for things that can be challenging, can have a different vernacular. But I think if we engage with the underlying data, if we look at, you know, how many millions of monthly active users there are on Ethereum, on Polygon, what are they doing? What are they opening up? What kind of applications they're using? What you're going to see is an analogy that's a lot more like an Apple application store with millions of users and hundreds of thousands of developers building stuff. And so I think it's very fair to react to the volatility in the asset class. But again, I think it's a bit of a lazy view on the whole thing. Well, Lex, as you talk about users, let's also get specific about who exactly they are. Because for so long, the narrative in crypto has been institutional buy-in is going to make a difference. It's going to be a stabilizing force kind of in the industry overall. But institutions aren't the very ones that are probably getting frightened by an episode like this. And really the episodes we've seen over the course of the last year. Where does that leave us if the institutional adoption starts to lag? Yeah, I think this is a really complicated question with a lot of nuance. I think you want institutional ownership of the asset class in the same way that for.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1491,2022-11-21 10:49:00
18878," Yeah, I think this is a really complicated question with a lot of nuance. I think you want institutional ownership of the asset class. In the same way that for equities, you might like to have institutional ownership and wrappers, whether it's exchange-traded funds or mutual funds, around the financial aspects of businesses. And crypto, again, you want stable holdings from high quality financial services companies, and packaging of those investments. But if you look at the actual, again, usage of applications in Web 3, whether that's people coming together through decentralized autonomous organizations, DOWs, whether it's people purchasing NFTs to reflect culture, whether it's people using other on-chain contracts and software, end of the day, a lot of that is going to be driven by how does retail adopt this new internet. And I think it's, while it's easy, it is a bit of a mistake to just think the whole thing is about trading. I will also say that you've seen increased correlation between traditional risk on markets, so whether it's equities or other risky investments and crypto. And that definitely tells us that institutional hands are all over these asset classes. And so they do move together. But the underlying fundamentals of how people are adopting the asset class is very much, how does the software usage go up and down? All right, Lex Socklin of Consensus. Thank you so much for joining us, really appreciate it.

Music This is Bloomberg surveillance early edition. I'm Kayleigh Lines with Matt Miller in New York and Anna Edwards in London. Happy Monday everybody. Let's take a quick look at what is coming up this week. On Tuesday, tomorrow, South African President Ramaphosa will be visiting the UK, the world's first head of state to be hosted first state visit by his majesty, King Charles. Then on Wednesday, we'll be getting Fed minutes at 2 p.m. Eastern time, provide some color on the Fed's meeting from November. U.S. markets will be closed on Thursday for the Thanksgiving holiday. Matt and I will be off eating turkey. Meanwhile, the EU Energy Ministers will be meeting to discuss the European Energy Crisis. And finally, we end the week with Black Friday. Discounts are expected to be higher this year to help drive purchases and all the while Anna, we will be slightly distracted by soccer or football as you call it with the world's. Yes, and I will be here for Thanksgiving. I'm just hoping that somebody in this office makes a peak empire and then it will be worth coming to work. But yes, we will be distracted by the football. So it could be a short and weak in the United States. And a week where we don't entirely concentrate on the markets here either. A lot of traders will be watching other screens. The 2022 World Cup has kicked off in Qatar. A lavish opening ceremony was followed by an opening match between the host and Ecuador. It's the culmination of a 12 year build-up. There's been marred by controversy over the initial bid. Human rights concerns and the environmental impact. Bloomberg's Simone Fulksman joins us now from Doha. The result wasn't the one that the host wanted last night, of course, Simone. But were they satisfied with how things were kicked off? Yeah, I think so. I mean, the opening ceremony in particular was pretty stunning. There were lots of world leaders in attendance, particularly regional leaders. President Abdel Fata, C.C. of Egypt. President Erdogan of Turkey shaking hands for the first time. And also Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman talking very closely with Gianni Infantino. But I think one of the things that's going to bring the controversy home yet again is a new decision by FIFA not to allow or at least threatened sporting sanctions against players if they wear rainbow armans. These are the one love armans. They're meant to be worn by captains of the English team, Danish team, seven actual teams coming out and wanting to wear these. But FIFA's decision has encouraged these teams to tell their captains, no, you can't. However, this kind of adds fuel to the fire around all these controversies, right? In telling these captains, they can't kind of demonstrate their free speech, demonstrate their support for LGBTQ rights. And obviously can't follow what the activists have told them, which is bringing, highlighting the controversial human rights issues in this country and around the world as a part of being players on the field. Simone, thank you very much. We'll be back to Simone folksman in Doha. England pay us Wales later. Matt, I'm sure this won't have a great to your attention. You'll be glued to the screen, no doubt. That was sarcasm, by the way. But maybe for the England USA game that happens a little bit later on? Yeah, no, I'll definitely, I love watching. Sorry, England Iran, I should have said. That's what I meant to say. That one I probably will give a miss. But if England plays the US, I'm very likely to watch that. And any of the big matches, I love to watch World Cup football. But I prefer to watch it, I think, from the television of my house rather than in a stadium, built by people who maybe didn't want to build it in Qatar. Yeah, there we go. Right, that's it for early edition. Surveillance is ahead. They'll be yelling from hearing from Carl Watt.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1493,2022-11-21 10:57:44

They'll be hearing from Carl Weinberg of High Frequency Economics. Among others commenting on the global economy, this is Blaineberg. So, you built a successful company, but you might not want to run it for the next 10, 15, 20 years, or do you? And if you didn't, would you want to go into government, if the president called you to serve our country? Would you go into government, or would you start another company? I love what I do. And I feel like I have this luxury with 23 me that it keeps evolving. You know, we started out just as a, you know, started out a consumer company. We're thick in research. We got into drug discovery in 2015, and now we're getting to the delivery of care. So, I've been really lucky with 23 me that it's been endlessly interesting. And I'm surrounded by incredibly talented, brilliant individuals where I learn from them. And what I always advise people to do is like, you should keep, you should take jobs where you're learning. And if you stop learning in the job, then you should quit. And like, frankly, when people leave 23 me, like, I say, if you're not learning anymore, you should move on. So, I'm 100% committed to 23 me. That said, my other passion is other direct to consumer. Like, I want to build out a true consumer and powered healthcare world. Like, one that is outside of the existing system. And I do, there's no greater force than government. PSO now is your online home for weekly Boston Symphony Orchestra and Boston Pops performances.

Good morning, everyone on radio on television. A really eventful week coming up with lots of mystery and clothing. We're going to get to this Mr. Eiger rejoining Disney and all the rest. China, we've got to talk about as well. But the major discussion at my house, Lisa, was simple. I need garden. Do you put sour cream in your mashed potatoes?

18881," your discussion at my house Lisa was simple. I need garden to put sour cream in your mashed potatoes. Yeah, you know, these are the kind of discussions this week that matter. The big week and the biggest most eventful week you could ever imagine how much are we going to fight over the turkey to see whether we put sour cream on it and whether we discuss Bitcoin over the table. I really do wonder. I mean, honestly, this is not a very eventful week. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. It's pretty good. But we are getting is a lot of your head reviews. And I find that interesting because they're coming out during this whole week. Exactly. Exactly. Maybe don't look at this. We'll revise it in March. And you're getting them and there are some consensus trades that you're starting to feel even in the turmoil that we're seeing. Yeah, we're going to talk about that as well including some disinflationary talk. Chef Patel will join us here to start us off. Margie Patel will join us in Boston here in a moment. This lets very quickly go through some of the immediate headlines. I'm not surprised. This is a cultural issue. Iger back in at Disney, not is chairman. And I'm sorry. I've always said this. Entertainment is about creative. And what this was is a failure of creative. Iger comes back in to jumpstart Disney creative. What this is about Walt Disney Company facing its worst year of stock loss is potentially going back to the 19th level. But they had a lot of company. They had a lot of company. And yet they are uniquely in pain due to perhaps the amount of money that they're emerging from Disney plus trying to rationalize the billion plus dollars of losses that they've seen there. How much does he really revive that considering that Bob Iger kind of founded some of the online streaming movements. Stock 203 down to the 86 level I believe in up to 90 and up nicely at today's. I want to talk a lot about this or trying to effort some of the true experts on this. But again, Lisa, to me, everything here is culture. Wall Street's culture, entertainment, the pixie dust of Hollywood is culture. And this is just a cultural discussion. Chapacout Iger and it's the culture also of activists getting more involved suddenly. You have more activist investors that are going to be kind of pushing things around a little bit more. The other aspect of this is how much are we going back to a pre pandemic norm for some of the entertainment companies, some of the tech companies that really built up in 2020 in 2021 when they were the only human town. And I wonder that was some of the tech layoffs, right? Two or as unique with 75% of the staff cut. Yeah, but is it right? I mean, are we going to start to see layoffs that start to seem pretty momentum? Yeah, I like to phrase somebody had this week tech session. I thought it was pretty interesting. And you wonder if it expands out from that. We've got to talk about China. Yesterday, afternoon late, I said to someone in the family, I said, this isn't normal. This is two, three hundred cases. Maybe it was embaging. I can't remember. As well, boom, in the Chinese Monday, they begin to recalibrate. The first death from COVID and quite a while in Beijing. Three deaths of the year. Yeah, the 87 year old man starting that off. And so you start to see curbs come back. But this really speaks to the how much hope was baked in the market that perhaps China would move away from zero COVID, even though China kept saying no or not. No or not. And so here you are, you're seeing that a little bit in some of the price action, but there is a feeling that China has to move away eventually. And the current schedule to join us. Let's get right to the day to hear. Yes, it's a holiday week, but yes, we continue to watch equity, bonds, currencies, commodities futures were the way to them negative 21 Dow futures. Same kind of idea. Actually, doubt is a little bit better than a percentage basis. Nastyk down seven tenths of a percent. And the VIX was a 24 level 23.90. I'm going to go right to it. We had a 15,000 handle on Bitcoin. It is fragile this morning, 16,000, 1, 1, 4 down fractionally. But 15,000 handle is not 16,000 reality on Bitcoin. In the bar market, Lisa, help me here. The 10s, 3.83 percent two year, you know, it's I'm going to call it a churn of non news. And yet there's that inversion still negative 71 basis. People expect the Fed Reserve to have to have to high rates pretty substantially into weakness. And then it's going to lead to further curve inversion. I'm curious to see whether we get defense big that really discusses that. And before this is really important, I think it's a sleeping time bomb West Texas intermediate American oil 7970. And for American oil to migrate down into the low 70s would be a huge deal in this holiday week. It's amazing to see oil come down. Are you briefing today or because of the holiday do we? Are we brief free? I'm briefing but brief light. So let's just go through it real quick. The Fed speak that we get today. We do get some San Francisco Fed President Mary Tilly.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1495,2022-11-21 11:06:29
18882," Come down. Are you briefing today or because of the holiday? Are we are we free? I'm briefing but brief light. So let's just go through it real quick. The Fed speak that we get today. We do get some San Francisco Fed President Mary Deley speaks from 12 p.m. Eastern to 145 p.m. How much does she talk about what we've seen in terms of what a pivot means? And this is something that's important. People are talking about a pivot meaning the Fed's stopping. Other people saying no. A pivot is when they actually move from a restrictive to a lesser-stricted stance, which isn't going to come in a very long time. We also get auctions today. I've said more than a little please. We'll get to the auctions in a moment. I want to do a shout out Mary Deley. I think she is the most interesting Fed official with first-order economic skill and she came from a really tough background. This is not some person that grew up in the suburbs with a silver spoon in her mouth. I think she's got a very unique perspective for Fed officials becoming hawkish as you see people in the lowest incomes seeing the most pain. She really brings unique perspective to this. We're also going to be getting earnings today, including from Zoom video communications after market. This is a very chart of their stock over the past five years. Kind of shocking to see the round trip. We got as high as nearly $570 on the shares. And currently they are trading at substantially less than that. It's just sort of shocking to see how much of a round trip, $81.64. I'm curious to see whether they can deliver on that. And then today this is what everyone's actually watching, which is the World Cup and the games that we have today are England versus Iran at 8 a.m. Sunday golf versus Netherlands at 11 a.m. And US versus Wales at 2 p.m. Secretary of State Tony Blinken will be attending Mac. Secretary said John Farrow looking towards the 8 a.m. England Iran. There's a skimming. I honest to Godly, so I'm like you I really don't focus on it. But after the 14th article in the telegraph in three hours, you know, you sort of skimmed the headlines. And at the minimum we can state, boy, did they take this seriously? I mean, it's England and Iran, but you know, they might be playing Germany today. We do too. And we'll be talking more about that later on because we're such experts in it. Right now, Margie Patel will join us and we start strong. This is in Lisa Brammer. Brammer was demanded that we start with Patel today. And we do. Margie, thank you so much for joining us. I was talking about you cooking up a storm in Boston this weekend with the distressed bird. I'm sure you'll make something of it. How distressed is the bond market? The bond market is in very good shape, particularly high yield. In fact, I would say if anything, there's actually a supply scarcity of good quality high yield paper to buy. So if had yield spreads widened out only a hundred or 200 basis points more than the treasury move. So high yield bonds, year to date, a far outperformed treasury's investment grade. It's really more lack of supply for buyers to buy. And defaults are under two percent. Michael Dardy in his weekend note is heated that the market is wrong on higher. He's looking for inflation in rates will fall meaningly. That's an opportunity from Margie Patel given a disinflation or price up yield down. Where's the best place to play? In the in the bond market, I think that better quality high yield is a very good place because if we have a real slowdown, if we have deflation, we may see defaults go from 2% to 4% or 5% their historic average. So that says take a little bit of risk and say a double b name, get less yield, but you'll be able to keep it and not lose your principal if there are higher defaults. How much are you looking at stocks under performing next year? We got some outlooks from a number of Wall Street banks and pretty much they are unanimous that next year is not going to be great for U.S. equities. Do you agree? No, I really don't. I think it's really at this point up in the air a lot depends on what the Fed does. If the Fed slows down their very rapid rate of increase, will that allow us to avoid a recession? I think on a relative basis, we'll still be better off than just about any other country in the world. And because people are so wary of this risk that says to me, maybe there's a lot of money on the sidelines. I would like to come in if it looks as if the year is clearing and the Fed is stabilizing or we miss a recession. Can you do it at the headline index level or do you have to be perhaps a little bit more sector-specific based on what's happening in tech? Well, I think you have to look at sectors. I think the technology has had a lot of problems. It's one of the big under-perform.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1496,2022-11-21 11:10:47
18883," Pacific, based on what's happening in tech. Well, I think you have to look at sectors. I think the technology has had a lot of problems. It's one of the big underperformers this year. But if you go back, say, to 2001, the market crashed. Tech was much, much more overvalued. The crash was much bigger. The recovery took much longer. This time, a lot of tech names, some of the semi-names are very reasonably priced for their long-term growth. Still volatile, but the PEs are down closer to what the expected growth rate will be. So we think a lot of parts of the tech market is pretty attractive here. Mark, you have been fearless about looking at equities for dividend growth and is an income trade. Is that true now? I think so, because you've had such a big correction equities, you really put the dividend yield, the cash flow yield, where it is actually competitive with investment grade bonds. So if we have any kind of a growth in the economy next year, it says to me equities well perform. I think 23 will probably be a rather muted, total return year, but I still think equities will do better than bonds. Mark, you tell, thank you so much. With all spring, global investment, it's just wonderful. Good luck with the distrust, Bird. As well. Lisa, John from Coventry emails in in front of the TV set just before England, two hours away from England. Thanks. John's is time. You went right over the auctions. What the hell are you doing? I know. I know. It was pretty much the most important. John was sad. Well, we would basically be blowing up the show. It would be auction Monday ahead of Thanksgiving, 1 pm. We get $54 billion. So what? Of $13 million and $43 billion to five year notes. The five year notes are most interesting to me. How do we deal with longer term inflation? That has been the biggest distinction that I have seen over the past couple of weeks. Suddenly, people are starting to talk about disinflation and outright deflation in a greater number of different sectors to get that feel in some of the auctions. The auction do really well. Do people flood in because this is an area of yields? And in this week, as Lisa mentions, we begin to look forward to 2023. We'll keep you abreast of the different Wall Street global, Wall Street reports on that. I should say, futures at negative 21 oil. I'm watching 79 70 West Texas intermediate Bitcoin 16,000. Keeping you up to date with news from around the world with the first word, I'm Lisa Mateo. While Chinese stocks and the yuan retreated as a string of reported COVID deaths and tighter restrictions in some districts, gave investors a rude reminder that the path to reopening will be rough, a city near Beijing that was rumored to be a test case for restrictions across China has asked residents to stay at home for five days. A potential sign officials are reverting to tighter COVID-0 curves. Meanwhile, the country's first COVID-related death in almost six months has sparked concern that Beijing could see a return of restrictions. The U.S. and Chinese defense chiefs are likely to meet for their first talks since Beijing suspended dialogue with Washington, overhouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi's August visit to Taiwan. Appending on spokesman says U.S. defense secretary Lloyd Austin would welcome a meeting with Chinese defense minister Wang Feng-Ga. Now, it's the latest sign that ties between the two nations are stabilizing. The cop talks in Egypt have ended with an agreement to help developing nations face the devastation of climate change. Although that deal is for a loss of damage fund, it paid for by rich countries. It's seen as a breakthrough, but negotiators fail to agree further cuts in CO2 emissions. Equity investors hoping for a better year in 2023 will be disappointed, according to strategists at Goldman Sachs Group, who say the bear market phase is not over yet. Strategists including Peter Oppenheimer and Sharon Bell predict markets will reach a final trough next year before a strong rebound.

What was your favorite project to do? The Reichstag does stand out because first of all it's an energy manifesto so it transformed something that was dependent on fossil fuels it uses all the technology to produce something which is essentially carbon neutral and there's a public building that's a statement. It's a symbol of a city, it's a symbol of a nation, it incorporates works of art, it's recycling and existing building which as I mentioned earlier is the ultimate in sustainability if you can give a new life to a building. It also creates public space at the roof level, it's the most visited parliament in the world so it puts the public above the politicians who are answerable to them and that of course was made possible by the politicians so it's a demonstration of democracy in action.

18885," We in the United States probably need to be careful about our evangelizing influence. I don't think it's really for us to tell China how they should organize their entire society. I think we're going to need to be very careful with respect to our diplomacy. Lawrence Summers are committed to Wall Street Week and we thank the former Secretary of Treasury for his comments on an often basis here on his economics and also, of course, the way economics folds into the Atlantic and Pacific society.

It has not been a surprise, but yet here it is. From China, there is again rising COVID and the current joins us now, Chief Asia Economic Correspondent here. And then you and I were talking about the symbolism of the hospital in Hong Kong from the 1930s, the Queen Mary Hospital, which is maybe where those T-leaves are discovered in your Hong Kong. Is Hong Kong like the rest of China with COVID or are there certain zones where things are worse? There are some parallels, Tom Hong Kong does have rising cases at the moment. People are watching what's going on with the hospitals and there are warnings that the hospitals are filling up again. Now, if you extrapolate that to what's going on in mainland China, well, there we know that cases are surging. We know that we've had the first reports of fatalities in six months and we know that we're heading into winter in China. And of course, all the warnings throughout the past year or so with since the arrival of Omicron, which is tested COVID-0, has been all about, has been all about can China's hospital network withstand and outbreak, especially China's regional and rural hospital network, or plenty of experts who say it will be put under a lot of pressure. And of course, is the vaccination rate, especially among the elderly at the kind of level that you need to protect your populace? You know, reporting this morning, folks, and this is the depth of the Chinese reporting of Bloomberg, we have age 80 vaccination with booster only at a stunning, really low 40 percent. That equates to I'm going to say 90 percent in America. Is this the moment and the current where Beijing gets on a first name basis with Pfizer in Moderna? Well, you know, China have not embraced the Western vaccines. They certainly have been pushing their own sign of vaccine. There's never been a good explainer, though. I think the outside looking as to why the vaccination rate among the elderly hasn't been at the level that it could and should be. Tom, there's a view that China has wasted the kind of the good COVID years when it was keeping the disease out and not getting the population inoculated. By the way, similar story in Hong Kong, there are parallels to the elderly population here. We're not protected. When it broke out then, we had a major crisis on our hands. So there hasn't yet been a satisfying explanation, I think, on China's vaccination rate, but there is a lot of focus on a due to start to ramp that up among the elderly and then beat your point. Where do they go with the Western vaccines and therapeutics? Do they eventually embrace them? Do they let them to be used in the populace? These are core metrics that are core signposts that people are looking at for, I think. And this doesn't sound wonderful. It's not as terrible as it has sounded. And yet when you take a look at the Wall Street analyst expectations for 2023, almost universally, they are all overweight China. They all expect some sort of recovery in the stocks and bonds of the second biggest economy in the world is what you're seeing on the ground consistent with that that we've seen the worst. And now it's just going to be about recovery and how quickly this nation can do that. So two things are going on. We had that pivotly on real estate, as you well know, a couple of weeks ago, basically the message from the government was continue to support the real estate sector, the banks and everyone involved that has lifted expectations for China's economy. Economists are saying that's a game changer. And on the other side and the COVID side of things, we had that pivot. We can argue what extent of it. But we had that signaling from Beijing that the hour on a path to COVID zero, eventually we have had messaging even today in the state pressing, you know, let's not have the broad base lockdowns or mass testing we've had, let's be more.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1499,2022-11-21 11:23:43
18886," past to COVID-0. Eventually, we have had messaging even today in the state press saying, you know, let's not have the broad-based lockdowns or mass testing we've had. Let's be more targeted and smarter in containing COVID. So that's what's boiling the optimism for China that maybe there is a way out. But let's not forget, we are going to winter now. It's going to be a huge test of how they do navigate COVID, especially their trajectory to move away from COVID-0. And of course, on the other side of things, we have the real estate story, has a long way to go, you know, both COVID has a long way to go in terms of lifting all restrictions. And the real estate story is far from ending its slump as well. So just a basis for optimism that maybe it's hit the bottom. But that doesn't mean the full recovery is in any way underway, just yet. How does the Tony Blinken trip to China really shape this narrative as well, heading into next year? It's more about good music, music, at least say, again, as a view that may be the US and China have put things put things in hold for the moment. It's called timeout on those tensions. Again, nobody's talking about any of these structural underlying issues being resolved. But when you have the government, the officials talk to each other on climate change, your own security or an economic matters, they're thinking that's obviously that's obviously bowed well compared to where they were before the G20 meeting between the two leaders. So I would say better mood music, but it doesn't solve any of the underlying problems. And very quickly here, are you sliding like a 12 hour work week here in football, Mad Hong Kong? I was at the Concert hotel there once and there were four games on at the same time. I mean, does Hong Kong stop for the world cup? Hong Kong is a big football city. Tom, uh, absolutely is. Difficulta this time around is the time zones or the time of the games over in Qatar aren't great for us. So I don't think anyone expects the bars of one-chair, like, why, long to be attacked as you wore in previous world cup, as previous world cups. But there will always be a die hard fans who will be out and watching them for sure. See how he said that? He's slidered by you see how he said, but Tom, you knew the answer to this. Of course. Well, you know, we did we did our, you know, world cup chat. And the current thank you so much for writing color. And seriously, no one talks to team surveillance, does it like end of current in his late evening in Hong Kong? You mentioned earlier the view to 2023. Anthony Dwyer and Michael Welch at Canagher, Genoody, out with a miss on. He's it's for Dwyer. I mean, Dwyer's an optimistic guy. I mean, he's, you know, he's not an optimistic guy. This is not an optimistic guy. The US will be Wells. And this is not an optimistic note when bad news becomes bad news. And look at that. Don't buy the pivot. Yeah. If a recession is coming, don't buy the pivot. Basically, this is something that John's talked about, which is if the Fed does not cut rates into a recession, if they hold rates where they are and the economic trajectory is slowing, that is restrictive. Even if they're not hiking further, and Mike of America put this out, well, they said to us, a pivot isn't stopping with rate hikes. It is cutting. And that is not going to be necessarily on the table for a while. Well, it's going to be interesting to see, but certainly for Mr. Dwyer, who's made a career of linking equity drops to recession. This is a unique note. He says, here's a recession, and he has trouble going along. So more instantly is Mike Wilson over the weekend, coming up today. He basically was defending some of the hate mail that he was getting on his projection that the S&P could fall to 3000 before going back to where it is right now. It's about a 24 percent decline from where we are now. And he basically said that people are pushing backs and you're crazy. And he's saying, look, we have to have some earnings paying if you're going to see the recession that so many people are expecting. We will see. We've got a wonderful set of guests coming up. I was actually thinking this weekend. I hope we can get Dr. Weinberg on. Carle Weinberg is going to join soon. Future is at negative 21. Our future is negative 79 to VIX.

Iger back to Disney as well we just spoke to our wonderful endocurrent in Hong Kong about the moment again for China and COVID right now with the data negative 21 rates they're giving me no help today oil a little bit like 79 68 on West Texas intermediate and some dollar strength finally we catch up on a narrow topic with Carl Weinberg he's chief economist managing director of high frequency economics sector Weinberg I have noticed it's not my chart of the year but it well could be the Bloomberg financial conditions index compare between the United States and the EU has never been wider Europe on a financial conditions basic basis is flat on its back what does that mean for the ECB in terms of their efforts to be responsible and to do quantitative tightening hey good morning Tom thank you for finding something on Bloomberg that even I couldn't find in terms of the financial conditions index what we're looking at what we're highlighting to readers of high frequency economics this morning is a huge change in what you just described the ECB's monetary stance is going to take a huge step tighter on Wednesday morning specifically they have raised the rates on their repose banks have the opportunity to pay them back they've signaled 296.2 billion euros worth of long-term depots to be paid back on Thursday on Wednesday morning that's going to increase the stock of bonds available to the market by 296.2 billion euros in one day and that should be a massive step toward reducing real money supply getting rid of the excess cash balances that are out there and more importantly increasing the supply of bonds and raising long-term yields. Well if they do this and I'm going to use a phrase from Jean-Claude Tresche he would talk to me about how economics diffuses differently through Europe I get that if we do QT in America what it means for Montana and Mississippi how does it diffuse across these nations it is a slower process in Europe to get the impact of this out into the market when the Fed undertakes QT it sells bonds to the market so people immediately exchange liquid cash for less liquid or illiquid bonds and that immediately affects their behavior in Europe the bonds are being returned to the banks they were held as collateral against repo agreements so the banks that will take their time or whatever time they take to sell those bonds back to the market because why on earth would a bond want to be would a bank want to be holding a bond when the price of that bond is sure to fall right they better off a cash so I think those bonds will get to the market but it will take a little bit longer than the QT impact those in the United States. At some says this sounds very narrow but the implications are as broad as you can imagine there is a feeling that when you head into a downturn you invest in duration you head into long-term government bonds of developed nations certainly what's happening in the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1501,2022-11-21 11:35:20
18888," are as broad as you can imagine. There is a feeling that when you head into a downturn, you invest in duration, you head into long-term government bonds of developed nations, certainly what's happening in the United States. Are you saying over in Europe and perhaps in the US, that is not the correct trade that you're gonna see yields on the longer end, on longer-term treasuries and guilt and boons go up, not down into a downturn. Well, Lisa, if we're not at the top of the Fed tightening cycle and we're barely approaching the top of the inflation cycle, bond yields are gonna go up, with or without QT, it's just a question of how far. So the QT makes the bonds look less desirable. It also raises the rate on long-term lending and that in turn depresses the economy because it discourages borrowing to invest. It discourages, we've already seen it in the housing market and mortgages. So yeah, long-term interest rates are probably going to go up from here, that doesn't mean the yield curve can't be inverted and that it can't continue to be inverted. And it certainly doesn't mean anything, we're still gonna get a recession at some point, although maybe not right away, but we are going to see higher long-term bond yields. Okay, so for how long? And I ask this because a lot of people are saying that the Fed does want to bring inflation onto control. So does the ECB and they're going to inflict quite a bit of pain in order to get that. Are you saying that they don't have the conviction to do that or just that all of the financial engineering over the past couple of decades is coming home to roost and that that long end will continue to go up for a longer period of time with higher real yields? Well, Lisa, I think that this whole process has a finite end. You know, we saw a massive surge in the supply of money to the economy and we've had too much money chasing too few goods and that's giving us the rise in prices that we perceive as inflation. But I don't believe that's an infinite process. I believe the adjustment of real money is being undertaken both by central banks and their QT combined with rising prices eroding the value of the nominal money supply and bringing down real money. In short, all right, it's a process that has a finite end point and by our calculations and high frequency economics, we have some great charts on this for our readers. We expect that most central banks will have gotten money supply back to where it ought to be for price stability within the next year. And that a year from now, we will be talking about the recession and hardly talking at all inflation. But we have to get there first and we're not quite there yet. Carl, you read on the stochastic nature of inflation. You look at the two bouts after 1947 and on and on and on. The pointed this of it, up we go high inflation. We turn around and disinflate rapidly. Is that your scenario? I don't think we have to see disinflation. All right, we've had, again, you look at the chart of money supply in the United States and I hate to sound like a monetary risk because I'm not one, but you've got to look at this chart, and you see this big bubble of money being printed and there's just too much money out there. So we have to wear that off. And a one time increase in money should lead to a one time increase in prices and it feels like inflation when we're doing it. And that's where we are right now, just instances. But it doesn't go on forever. All right, and we don't have to see prices falling just that we stabilize at a higher level. Let me go Milton Friedman, David Ladler on you as we go monitorist. Where does that money go if we have a balloon of money? Well, first of all, the Fed takes a lot of it back with its quantitative tightening and that's what we're starting to see now. And that's where we're going to see in Europe on Wednesday morning, we're going to see a big step toward reducing the money supply in Europe and getting it to where it should be within a year. And the other place it goes is that rising prices make the real money stock, the amount of goods and services that the money can buy, all right, get become less. So therefore, all right, we then adjust the amount of money we have to the amount of goods and services we're producing. So the money doesn't disappear, but real money gets eroded by the rising prices and the central banks do the right thing which is what they're doing, which is start to take it out with quantitative tightening. This right sizing of monetary policy, what does that do in terms of the depth of the recession that you're predicting? Well, the recession itself, there are a number of factors behind the recession. Some of them are just cyclical, all right. Some of them, the biggest component of it though is that I believe that wages have not kept up with prices that by the way is your clue that the inflation is not going to be self-sustaining. And we have real incomes coming down. So we have probably a pretty powerful recession coming. We also had a pretty powerful boost out of this, coming out of this wonky.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1502,2022-11-21 11:39:41
18889," And we have real incomes coming down. So we have probably a pretty powerful recession coming. We also had a pretty powerful boost out of this coming out of this wonky recession that we just had. I mean, re-reJ Powell's speech at Jackson Hole, not last summer, but the summer before. He says, this is the darnedest thing I've ever seen. We had a recession and incomes blown up at the same time. How could that be? We've got a lot of excesses that we have to purge. So I think we have a sizable correction in the economy to come. I can't put a number on it right now. Right. I think it's going to be a pretty substantial one. It's not going to be a little on it. Carl, what's your theme for your 2023 outlook? Give us a window into that. I think we're going to more for our concerns away from inflation. Prices will stabilize and then we'll be thinking more about the recession. So it's a pivot in your language, all right? A morphing of focus away from inflation is prices stabilized. Carl Weinberg, thank you so much. I frequency economics, just a terrific brief. We're leaving there, Lisa. We've got to have Dr. Weinberg back because I would even get to one of his four days, which is the emerging market for jillities that are out there. Friday, look for it, folks. A brammo, I'll be off Friday after surviving my cooking. A brammo with Damien Sassower. What an inspired pairing. Well, I love that I'm with Damien because you guys all ditched me to go enjoy your second day of the Thanksgiving holiday. But Damien's going to be the trooper that comes in here. We're going to talk to all sorts of strategists and focus on fixing come and talk about what's going on with the shopping. Are you going to do shopping? No, no, it's England, U.S. I think Friday. I can't remember. There's a big, big game Friday. John and I've already picked out a bar. He says I have to go below 59th Street. So, you know, that's what we'll be doing Friday. Have fun. And we hear even more people clicking off. I do want to just point out one thing. Carl Weinberg was talking about the year ahead. And what do you get if you pull out all of this extra money that Central Banks pulled in? I don't know. I'm going to turn them on a gloom there. So, Morgan Stanley, to put out their outlook and talked about where they disagreed the most and where they had the most heated disagreements had to do with the housing market. And this to me was fascinating, that they really had a controversial moment where they think that there is going to be a massive decline in the number of sales, but there isn't going to be a huge decline in prices. This is one of the big, distinguishing features. People think that there isn't going to be this massive housing route, even though you've got 7% mortgage rates. And to me, this is one of the biggest question marks because this is the first area that really feels how much we've jacked up rates and what the consequences are. I strongly agree with this. And first of all, in our prism here within three zip codes of New York City, we don't know what we're talking about. Let's start with that. But the bottom line is they're dead on and that housing is a huge part of the economy, huge part of inflation. Oh, we are and all that is hugely behavioral. To me, it's underplayed. It's not just about statistics and coal math. And just like you say, people are going to see an X percent decline in their house and they're going to go, let's sit on it. Well, and where else can they move? Right? If borrowing costs are where they are, there's going to be no inventory, which is what you're seeing now to some degree. Shout out to Stephen Roach, who invented modern Morgan Stanley economics, which has always been visibly fractious. And we think that is a good and powerful thing.

And some of the cities with destroyed infrastructure, the Ukrainians are simply pulling out people because they cannot live in that nascent winter cold. And a real attack right now on the electric system, on the electric grid, by Russia, on Ukraine. How much is this really causing an escalation that's really creating a bit of discomfort, and even more discomfort around the world? Very good. Right now, we're going to stop the show. And we made a decision here, at least 15 years ago to say, yes, we do economics, finance, and investment. But far more, we do international relations not knowing the world would be turned upside down as we have seen in the recent decades. Providing leadership worldwide on that has been Richard Haas. He's president of the Consulate Foreign Relations, full disclosure. I'm a member when I pay my dues. I think I'm behind him. I do, Richard Haas. But we'll go there another time. He is rebelling. The Bitcoin that payment was really important. The Bitcoin worked out. Richard Haas is retiring, pulling away from truly his Consulate Foreign relations. Richard Haas, thank you so much for joining us so much to talk about today. Where must the Consulate Foreign Relations go to lead as fractious international diplomacy? Well, Tom, first of all, I'm not retiring from anything. I'm departing the Council after 20 years. But I'm going to stay active in the public conversation, both about this country's role in the world, as well as about the future of American democracy. But I think it's healthy for institutions, despite what's going on in Disney. I think it's kind of healthy for institutions every now and then to have a change in leadership. I think for the Council, it's simply to continue to be a resource on a wide range of challenges, whether it's the revival of geopolitics or global issues. We're just finishing up the COP27 meeting in Charm El-Sére, you can quite honestly, I think it's almost a complete nutter failure. And I also think increasingly we need to look at the relationship between America internally and America externally, and whether we're ever going to be positioned to again lead the world, because this world is not going to organize itself to meet the challenges it faces without an involved and effective United States. So I think the inbox in this field is as full as it's ever been. I agree with that strongly in folks. The brief here 240 pages is Richard Haas, the bill of obligations is he and we go in search of the will of America to move forward. Richard Haas, the new administration, the new Congress, the new presidency two years out, do they have the will to find their bill of obligations? I don't see a lot of it, Tom. I'll be honest. You know, I don't think we're off to a great start. The new Republican House of Representatives seems much more interested in politics than policy and investigations than legislation. I think for the next two years, it's going to be extraordinarily difficult for the Biden administration to get legislation passed really about anything. I think you're going to see there for an emphasis on foreign policy, where presidents traditionally have more discretion than they do on things domestic.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1505,2022-11-21 11:52:33
18892," really about anything. I think you're going to see there for an emphasis on foreign policy, where presidents traditionally have more discretion than they do on things domestic, and probably a greater emphasis on regulation, on executive action, again, to essentially find ways to do things without requiring Congress to join. In this fractious global order, how confident are you that the U.S. remain close to Europe, at least as close to Europe as they have traditionally based on some of the recent fissures, not only with respect to exactly how to deal with the energy crisis, but also with tech investments and some of the bills that Congress has passed so far that really focus on the U.S. Two good questions. I think it's a mixed record. On one hand, if this administration, the Biden administration stands for anything, and it's an alliance first foreign policy, and I think the entire management of the Ukraine crisis, the Russian crisis, has been pretty good. You also see a growth in transatlantic trade, whether because of energy or a de-emphasis on trading with adversaries or re-emphasis on trading with friends. We're on worried about over the long term is not so much Russia as it is China, and I think there could be a growing split between what you might call American economic pressure on China, almost economic warfare, and Europe led by Germany looking to China in many ways to compensate for the loss of economic ties with Russia. And if there were to ever be a crisis over Taiwan, this divergence across the Atlantic, one makes a crisis more likely because China may not fear sanctions, or if there were a crisis in the United States wanted to introduce sanctions, I could imagine a big transatlantic split. This is really important, especially as German Chancellor Olaf Scholz just went to China with a bunch of executives, a big industrial companies. How much do you give credence then to the softening in tone that we've heard at least recently with the U.S. and China and Tony Blinken heading over there early next year? Look, I think it's good. I'm an old-fashioned diplomat, so I actually happen to believe in diplomacy. I think that's progress. I thought the meeting in Bali was a useful exchange. I think it's useful to have follow-up, but let's not get ourselves. These countries are in very different pages. The question is whether they can set up some rules of the road about how to limit their differences over Taiwan, so it doesn't lead to conflict. But I don't see any sign, for example, that China is lending a hand to deal with North Korea, which is busy building up nuclear weapons and shooting off missiles. I don't see the China's helping with Iran. We can go around the world. So geopolitically, the two countries are not on the same page. China's still not helping with climate much. So, again, to me, the real question with the United States and China with these talks is whether they can avoid negatives more than achieve positives. I got up with part of the House being a middle-twentieth-century isolationist, what was called a Chicago Tribune Midwest isolationism, something I'm sure you saw West of Oberlin, Ohio. And when I look at where we are today, Richard Haas, we have a new isolationism. It's always there, but this time is different. Call it the character of America's new isolationism. Right. We're seeing it, Tom, and it doesn't respect party lines. We're seeing it in both the Republican Party and the Democratic Party. You see in the Republican Party a kind of flirtation with Russia, this talk about conditioning or limiting aid to Ukraine on the progressive side of the Democratic Party. Again, an impatience over money spent for foreign policy or national security abroad wanting to see more at home. What's missing on both sides of the aisle is an appreciation of two things. One is that money spent on foreign policy is good for us here at home. We are not going to do well in a world that unravels. He's my favorite word in a world in disarray. Secondly, what else has said home for the most part is not a lack of resources being spent. You look at how much we're spending domestically. That's not the problem. It's how we spend money is the issue much more than how much we spend. Most increasingly, as you know better than anybody, what's crowding out a lot of useful forms of domestic spending is not national security. It's servicing our debt. And that's something if people on the left and the right wanted to free up money to devote to domestic causes, they could focus very much on the size of America's debt. Richard, thank you so much.

So, is there more pressure when you're trying to win a basketball championship than when you're trying to please investors? Where's the greater pressure? Oh, I think it's definitely trying to win a championship. It's hard because when you invest and you know this, when you're investing, you can control a lot more things. When in a basketball court, you can't control whether somebody's going to make a shot, you've got to get lucky. And what's the greater pleasure making five times your money to want to distress debt investment or winning the NBA championship? They're both fabulous. I wish I could do one each year, that would be great. But I think there's a great feeling in being right on an investment, that you've done a tremendous amount of work and you've made money for your clients, which I think is great. I think winning a championship is, it's a very surreal feeling because there's a whole city or state that is actually behind you. You know, we had 70,000 people at the finals and we had them all outside. We had 17,000 in stands and then literally like 60,000 people outside. And when we won, like just the joy that you had brought to the city was phenomenal. The top names in climate change are on Bloomberg.

Today, especially for countries such as Greece. Nobody covers climate change like Bloomberg, your global business authority. We're in the early stages of a sustainability revolution that has the magnitude of the industrial revolution coupled with the speed of the digital revolution. Nobody covers climate change like Bloomberg, your global business authority. This economy is still the most resilient economy in the world. The rally could continue. I do think it is a bear market rally.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1507,2022-11-21 12:01:13
18894," This economy is still the most resilient economy in the world. The rally could continue. I do think it is a bear market rally. I mean, you know, it could go to the end of the year. There are huge opportunities underneath the surface. It was still going to be facing a lot of volatility in 2023. Really what we're dealing here is potentially with an earnings decline that has not yet priced into the market for 2023. This is Bloomberg's surveillance with Tom Keane, Jonathan Farrow, and Lisa Abramowitz. Good morning, everyone. Jonathan Farrow, Lisa Bramowitz and Tom Keane. I'm on the on radio on television in one hour England or ran. John Farrow's not in today. I'm shocked Lisa. I wonder why he had five minutes. A sign made. Yeah, not only that, but you know how he was putting up his tree ahead of Thanksgiving. Yeah. Well, guess what? So did Bloomberg. So you got the tree and you've got the World Cup and he's off to his back. Yeah, well, you know, he's he's he's killing it here and Thanksgiving week. We hope John enjoys his World Cup. We do actually do miss him because of his really true knowledge of all that's going on here. Cutter record or you saw it yesterday. I saw it. It was pretty cool. Yeah, it was cool, although cutter is sort of sad for them because this is their real tour to force. I mean, this is when their country really put all the money into it and then they just couldn't really make it. Yeah, but that's my my take is there it is. And the people committed this like Mr. Farrow within cyclopedic knowledge. They're going to love it. We have to sort of follow along with respect and it's in America the next time around. You didn't say it was a massive week ahead. No, it's not a massive week ahead. It's a big you know Thanksgiving week folks. We talked to Margie Patel about her distress bird. She's cooking futures negative 22. You know, I look at it and I think it's such an odd week. It's good to have the news hole in the morning. Let's go through the two items right now. I go back in at Disney. Were you surprised? I am not surprised given the fact that the shares have absolutely plummeted that Disney plus is losing more than a billion dollars a year. You're seeing this real push from activists do something bring back somebody really. Right. Generally a culture that was successful, but this was someone who really pioneered a lot of the streaming and really tried to push for a lot of streaming. What are they going to do off a offload? Yes, PN. Is that what they're thinking? My take on this is a sunset tower hotel in a Hollywood and their wonderful poolside restaurant where people like Mr. Iger hold court. This is about creative people. Mr. Chatebeck was not a creative person even he admitted that. And with all that's going on, particularly as Paul Swini says in the streaming death we're seeing right now get Iger back creative before they find a new creative person. This is a specific industry and yet wholesale Disney is not the only one that's facing some of the worst losses in their history and they're down the most now going back to the 1970s or points for the worst annual loss. How much you're going to see more of this kind of pushing for activism for for for for changes in the sea suite because that's really also it's underpitting this. You have Nelson Peltz coming in there trying to push for change. You've got other activist investors saying. Yeah, not working. You need to prioritize us and it's going to get rough her head. How much is this going to end up being what's going to happen at a number of different companies going forward? Yeah, it's going to be interesting to see on China. Let's get right to an end occurred. Really I thought was informative there in the last hour. This is for real. It's a new lockdown. Well, and this is because you're actually seeing cases spread this is sort of the carrot and stick approach of reopening in China. They don't have the collective immunity and you ask the good question to end occurred about what about Pfizer? What about more? Do you know when are they going to start importing more effective vaccines and we don't know. Well, I mean, just we don't know there's it's all there is to it. Let's do this. We've got such a wonderful guest here. Let's get to the data right away and then dash to your brief futures negative 22 where they've been on morning bonds give us no information. This morning there is some economic data this week and of course we stagger on to that critical inflation report that we see in December and the jobs report more important now. We've got 22 weeks ago to 10 spread gives me next to nothing negative 70 basis points. I think oils important. Lisa to have oil crack. Would be really important. We're not there yet. West Texas just under $80 barrel. Yeah, but this is on the potential weakness not only with respect to China and potential lockdowns but also just globally as you start to see. I think it's a good deal to rise by the way it's countdown to meeting minutes on Wednesday. Yeah, for me. They put about on Wednesday to bury him in the Thanksgiving. Sorry, but someone who is a theme to be the take over the bank.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1508,2022-11-21 12:05:49
18895," Wednesday to bury him in the Thanksgiving. Accid, I do want to point out, and I can't cite it, I'm so sorry. But someone who is a theme to be the takeover at the Bank of Japan, make clear he wasn't thrilled about yield curve control. And Yen, out 1% today, two big figures, 142, round it up, is a weaker Yen. And I think that's important. Oh, that's fascinating. But it's important. We'll keep track of that throughout today also. So what I'm looking at for today is, if I speak, we have one. San Francisco Fed President, Mary Daly, is going to be speaking for almost two hours, starting at 12 p.m. Eastern. How much she going to talk about the auctions, because we're all focused on the five-year auction at 1 p.m. today. But we also want to hear from her about how long she sees the Fed keeping rates potentially above 5%. When she starts to feel that perhaps any to ease or pivot into a less restrictive stance. Today, earnings include Zoom video communications after market. We were talking about Disney. How much do you start to see a complete rethink of companies that were completely bit up during the pandemic, completely been up in the air? Right, and Disney was Zoom. I don't think you can do that. There is only the similarity that they both ballooned in eras where suddenly people are rethinking the whole era of work versus home, of entertainment versus external experiences. So this is sort of a question mark. What do you do facing the new reality? And today, this is all that people really care about. The world cup games include England versus Iran and about an hour time. Senate golf versus Netherlands at 11 a.m. U.S. for Swales at 2 p.m. I'm looking forward to that. I'm looking forward to USA Wells. I am as well, and I promise you that we'll need to get experts rather than us to try to pretend they can. It's a good David Blanche flower on tomorrow. I'm sure he'll be watching. I'm sure everyone's watching instead of this. And not going to be really looking for my insights in it. Then the letter is going to be compelling to see some of the diplomatic kind of aspects. God, they thank you so much for watching in Hollywood in the early Hollywood morning. God, they makes very clear that Mr. Eiger wouldn't be seen in the restaurant of the sunset tower hotel. He would be in the tower bar. That's a surveillance correction. Thanks. Thanks. God, they're pointing it out this morning. Right now, and if you're taking notes on the equity market, get out the pad, get out the paper. As Katie Kaminsky, chief research strategist at Alpha Simplex is a turtle. She is a turtle trader from way back, which is trend matters. Katie, everybody would kill for your performance this year, still up 40%. What is the trend forward or are trends breaking now? Yeah, Tom, it's been a phenomenal year for trend and a year where things are very uncertain. What we have noticed though is that we're going through an inflection point right now, like we saw earlier this summer, we're starting to see that shorter term signals and longer term signals are kind of at odds. And so I think we just like the rest of the market are looking for a pivot to the next big trend. So far, you're looking at a day like today, the dollar is coming back a little bit that may not be over. And of course, short bond signals are still there in the data. Well, Katie, can you elaborate on that, this sort of pivot point that you see in terms of short term and longer term signals? What is that pivoting us to? We've come from an era where bonds have been all over the place, but we saw a rally recently, we saw stocks being, both stocks and bonds rallying. What's the new pivot? What's that new reality? Well, the thing is we've really, the challenge has been that we've had a mixed signal. So there's no clear signal net at this point. And that's why I say we're definitely at an inflection point. But if I had to look a little closer at what has changed the most, optimism has come into signals at a level that is consistent with what we've seen recently. So we've seen more positive signals and equities, especially around the CPI print. You're also seeing a little bit more reversion out of the dollar trade, but that's still there. So that's why it's kind of said, it's a balance between what do we see shorter term and longer term? And the longer term signals are still definitely saying that there's some things to worry about ahead, especially the curve, the yield curve being inverted recently. Katie, you've nailed it with bonds in particular. You went short bonds, which has been the widow maker for so many years. And this was one of the areas where you absolutely knocked it out of the park with nearly 40% returns so far this year. How much do you buy this conviction that we're feeling in Wall Street that that's?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1509,2022-11-21 12:10:01
18896," We're absolutely knocked out of the park with nearly 40% returns so far this year. How much do you buy this conviction that we're feeling in Wall Street? That that's going to be the biggest area of our performance by 10 year, by 30 year treasuries, and you're going to just do really well next year. So we did some research this year on bonds. It was called the short of shorting bonds. And one of the things that we need to think about if we're moving into a much more focused on rising rates and higher rates environment is that bonds are not going to behave under inflationary pressures like they did in the past. And this year was just the first data point to show us that that's the case. And I think what has been the most fascinating to me is how we avoid thinking about long bias. And so many of us are so dependent on being long bonds, we forgot what it's like to actually think about how do you deal with actually shorting bonds and how do you deal with bonds and valuation versus inflation. And I think that is going to be the key question for all investors in the next few years. What's great about trend following folks, and this is rumored folks, Liverpool, maybe up for sale, John Henry owner of the Red Sox arch turtle trader, rumour has it, Henry may sell Liverpool to Kaminsky. We'll have to see on that is well, we get a lot of emails Katie when you're on with this, are moving averages helpful to trend followers? Yes, I mean, I think the way we think about it, moving averages, if you want to measure the strength of a trend, these days we use a wide range of different methods. Some of it is based on machine learning, some of it is based on different types of breakout signals, but the point is in environments where the world is very uncertain, you have to turn to what the market is doing as opposed to what it should do because frankly, few people actually know what it should do these days because it's so volatile and unclear what the future is actually going to hold under this inflationary environment. Katie, thank you so much. Katie Kaminsky, arguably the number one performance of surveillance guests this year at Alpha Simplex, is well, it's just stunning to me to see Lisa how trend following versus gaming, catching a knife in the dark, how trend following, there's some years where it just clicks in with the vengeance and this was one of them. Turtles? Turtles, this goes back to the 70s, I think, two guys wrote a book or a paper even and they called it turtle trading because of the patients required and it started out pretty much with CTAs and the C is for commodities because it's a general rule commodities trend more than the other asset classes.

Future is at negative 23 down futures at negative 89. This is Bloomberg. Good morning. Keeping you up today with news from around the world with the first word, I'm Lisa Mateo. Chinese stocks in the yuan retreated as a string of reported Covid deaths and tighter restrictions in some districts gave investors a rude reminder the path to any reopening will be rough. A city near Beijing that was rumored to be a test case for removing virus restrictions across China has asked residents to stay at home for five days. A potential sign officials are reverting to tighter Covid zero curves. Meanwhile, the country's first Covid related death in almost six months has sparked concern that Beijing could see a return of restrictions. The US and Chinese defense chiefs are likely to meet for their first talks since Beijing's suspended dialogue with Washington. Overhouse speaker Nancy Pelosi's August visit to Taiwan. A Pentagon spokesman says US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin would welcome a meeting with Chinese defense minister Wei Feng-Jai. Now it's the latest sign that ties between the two nations are stabilizing. The cop talks in Egypt have ended with an agreement to help developing nations face the devastation of climate change. Although the deal for a loss and damage fund paid for by rich countries is seen as a breakthrough, negotiators fail to agree further cuts in CO2 emissions.

We've invested more than $10 million in our employees over the past year and we're going to continue to invest more. We're testing four-day work weeks to help, you know, especially our working parents kind of juggle that balance between childcare and your work. I know I deal with that all the time. This is really a people-first company. In an inflationary environment, you're going to see us continue to lead with our people. Do you worry at all about a price wage spiral, not just here, but in the industry, in the economy? Yes, and I think that, you know, this is something that, you know, many business leaders are focused on and, you know, time will tell kind of how all of this lands. I think the wage-price spiral continues for quite some time and I think we probably have been a lot less aggressive than we can be and than many other companies have been. In terms of raising crisis, yes, we've taken our time. If you look at a 20-year history of pricing in this company, we've taken about 2% a year on average. We've never taken what we could. We've always taken what we should. We have to pay people more. We have been and will continue to do so. We'll take a little bit of a margin compression on that as we've had to and I think that's the right thing so that for the long term, Shake-Chack continues to be what we're building, which is the next generation's burger joint.

I think it will probably be appropriate soon to move to a slower pace of increases, but we have additional work to do. Nobody covers the Fed like Bloomberg. There is more work to be done. I expect that this will require additional increases in the federal funds rate followed by a period of holding rates at a sufficiently restrictive level for some time. Susan Collins of Boston managing the message forward for the Fed Mary daily as a lonely speaker today. I believe Lisa Mary daily importance is Collins is important is everybody from the Fed speak you follow is everybody on the same page. I think so at this point there is a feeling that you need to get restrictive that inflation is the first and the foremost concern. Lamb Brainer perhaps has been by sure most device chair has been perhaps the most reluctant to go all in in terms of how far the Fed has to go in terms of how long they have to stay there, but it's pretty unanimous. Inflations number one concern period full stomach Dr. Brainer having a cumulative Thanksgiving it will be the accumulation of cooked onions mashed potatoes cream squash cream onions yes cranberry sauce how do you do potatoes? How do I do potatoes? Someone else does before we make mashed potatoes. Okay, but you know I can go either way there. I mean it's it's good anyway there's the Fed speak today we won't ask Mary daily today what she's going to cook for things you may Alex Web doesn't celebrate Thanksgiving he's in London and joins us now with Bloomberg quick take in here on the many happy thoughts as Peter Pan said to Wendy John and I think it was Alex as well and Peter Pan think happy thoughts Alex to begin there are not happy thoughts today at Disney there is repair what does Mr. Eiger have to repair? Yeah, I mean I think that what had happened during lockdown and not to the labor the analogy too much but there was second start of the right carry on some morning while morning has arrived and actually what they were trying to do during the lock downs was under pressure from activists and investors they pivoted basically towards being a gross stock they cut the dividend they invested that in Disney plus in content for Disney plus with the hope that they would get close to the 50 plus price to forward earnings multiple the netflix was enjoying at the time and that worked it worked during the lockdowns of course what we now seen is that there's a with rising interest rates we've seen flight away from from growth stocks and we've seen therefore netflix shares come down of course exacerbated by stagnating user growth and Disney shares come down as well Disney has reinstated the dividend but is still far lower than it was three four years ago so the question for Bob Eiger is like do you take more capital away from Disney plus and do you then try to return some of that capital investors because you know returns now what people sort of more immediate returns of what investors are looking for Alex that's the financial here I'm very fascinated by the creative side of which mr. Eiger excels is he simply a caretaker is they go out and find a new creative CEO he clearly is a caretaker in the sense that he's been given a two year contract and it's hard given his age to imagine that would be extended much beyond that even though he saw his contract extended time and again you know before he ultimately hands it over to Bob Chapeck look his approach to Disney was trying to stabilize earnings by investing in franchises we saw that with Pixar we saw that with Marvel and we saw that with Star Wars who's with you know Lucas film where they built these franchises where you could pretty much be guaranteed you'd be getting an audience for their films that helps stabilize revenue over a relatively long period now the calculations a little bit different as we look at the streaming world where you need to have so much more content it's not just tent poles you need a regular cadence that is very capital intensive and now the market is question was",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1512,2022-11-21 12:22:58
18899," You look at the streaming world where you need to have so much more content. It's not just tent poles. You need a regular cadence. That is very capital intensive. And now the market is questioning whether that capital intensity is ever really likely to reward you with stable revenue. How much is this a Disney story, Alex? And how much is this a broader story about right sizing, a company that really expanded during an era of free money and then a pandemic distortion around entertainment? I think you're right that there is a broader piece here that lots of other companies, particularly as we say, these kind of inadvertent commerce gross stocks have had to do a little bit of correction. There is a lot of Disney-specific stuff because there is an element with Bob Chepek that yes, maybe he mismanaged some of the capital market stuff. But there is also internal culture stuff. Some of his engagement with politicians, not least in Florida, which were not taken particularly well by the employees. If you've lost the investment community to an extent and you've lost your employees again to an extent, then you can see why the board might sit there and go, well, actually, this is the right man for the job. Who buys ESPN? Well, ESPN is a cash cow for Disney, right? It doesn't really make sense for them to want to get rid of it. I'm sure there are plenty of people out there who would like to buy it. The signals we've seen pretty much without fail have been that Disney does not want to sell it. And you can see why. Think about it in terms of the New York Times. New York Times might be pivoting towards digital, but for much of the past five years, it's still made very good money from ads in its print business. So Disney has a similar approach. Yes, you might think that cable is a dying business or is in slow long term decline, but it still remains highly profitable and generates a huge amount of cash. Alex Webb, thank you so much. Gotta go see on the second star and the right. Alex Webb there with our Peter Pan theology in London. It's the only place you can do Peter Pan. I mean, you know, I mean, how many times have you seen Hook, which was not on Disney? I mean, Hook was on try star, but you know, Dustin Hoffman, Robin Williams, how many times have you seen Hook? How many times have you really watched Disney plus? I do. I just finished all of Ander. I actually liked it. It was actually almost successful. Well, I wonder how much they can cater to adults because that's the thing. That I'm the really the other than that. No, babysitter for children. And now they have to sort of readjust, especially with Hulu. Well, there's some enthusiasm out there. I know Doug Cass looking at Disney this morning and finding it attractive. I believe it's his third largest holding in Jason Bassinette over at City Group reaffirms here. Lisa 92 up to where I think it right now is roughly 99.73 and his price target 145. He says, Iger, there's going to be some theology here. Like what does Disney do with sports betting? Well, the answer is Iger's not so sure they want to do that. Well, this is a culture question. I do just look at the pan at the shares are down 41% year to date. Everything else is to OK, but this is the question. It's defense, but this is the question. When do we bought up? Right. And that's really the issue. People are seeing this as an opportunity. OK. Now it's sort of reset in terms of the pricing. So when do we see the mother? And that's the catharsis that we've been looking for that people are really talking about. Paul Sweeney is on the same page as Michael Nathan and Nathanson and Richard Greenfield. It's to show me a sustained profit model of streaming. And I just don't think it's there. And I just, I don't see it. And what about bundling, right? Who's going to be the bundler? Who's going to be someone who takes this and really offers it in a way that is comprehensive? That is organized. That is going to give people some sort of price realism. Because honestly, when you start to put them all together, it starts to be more than cable. I mean, I don't know. I just, I look at it like this weekend. And I was watching this Bombay thing on Apple TV. It's an Indian thing. They're in Bombay. Some Australian guy goes up to Bombay and he's got a hideout in the slums and all that. Well, how do they make money at that? I don't mean the actors are clearly overpaid. There's no question about it. But how do they make money at that? I'm struggling to know where to go with this. A Bombay thing and there are people going around. And how do they make money? Look, I think that your point is well taken. That they travel to their big budget, that they're big productions. And then how do they generate the enthusiasm when it's all over the place and is for places? But Netflix has turned it around more than people had expected. Conditioned to do the same. I don't know. We'll talk to the experts on this fascinating, Mr. Eiger back at Disney. Future Zilla tapes not giving me much love today. Japanese yen, 142. Weaker yen, that's important. This is Bloomberg.

When I started, I had no idea it was going to turn into this. It was a trix new empire. I don't have any investor. All this is all money in. This is me going out in Hustlin, bringing that money back, and just building it, building it. Yeah, I think about a person that was homeless at one point. I didn't really have any money coming in. The fact that this person was relentless and just determined to succeed and not let rock bottom define him as an individual. I can take things and put them together and take them apart and make them better and put them back together. I respect the craft, so I don't want to minimize and disrespect the value of each step of the craft and do by machine what should be done by hand. A lot's happening on Wall Street. I'm quite encouraged. The center is holding. Need to catch up. This is Bloomberg Wall Street week. I'm David Weston. We've got the information and insight. A lot of these areas still have very, very good valuations. From businesses most influential and instrumental. It's knocking it out the bolt, though. And I was not a great time to be speculative.

And I need to say thank you to all of you out in the Zeitgeist who have been very supportive of how we address Bitcoin. Lisa, I'll be honest. And in hindsight, it's easy. But if none of this blow up had happened, I still would say it. We've killed ourselves.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1514,2022-11-21 12:31:59
18901," I'll be honest, in a hindsight it's easy, but if none of this blow up it happened, I still would say it. We've killed ourselves trying to be balanced on this. And to try to not buy into the incredible enthusiasm at a time when a lot of people didn't understand it, but we're still investing in it. Yeah. We'll have to see what we're going to do here is talk to two experts and Bitcoin. But first we've got to look at a non-mover market with futures negative 20. How did you start with this? Yeah, basically we're just going to do it real quick. Disney shares up after people looking at what's going to happen with perhaps a new leadership. I'm looking right now to pop of eight and a half percent. I'm also looking at some losers Las Vegas sands and win resorts. And this really is on the prospect of perhaps renewed shutdowns in China. And it really shows how much the entire entertainment business hinges to some degree on what happens there in China. That's it. I'm not going to like sit on this because this is a market that stays in the head of the market. Yeah, that's what we're going to do here. You'll see it Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. Rumor has it. Bramow and Thursday is well. John and I are really on our way to Doha. Thanks. I appreciate it. And Tim. With Damien Sassar, that's cool. That is cool. We're going to have a great time. A cool Bitcoin. I'm going to start with Katie Griefeldt. Of course, she has been outstanding in giving us coverage. A KDF, I was teaching a lecture on point and figure charting Bitcoin from 61,000 down to 16,000 is one of the ugliest charts I've ever seen. Today we dip under 16,000 to 15,000. Does anybody care about that price action? I would say so again, that $16,000 level for better or worse, it's really held. We did get about 20 words where we were going to help. Well, you know, we're talking about round-ish numbers. Round-ish. You say the chart is ugly. I think in a way, it's kind of beautiful. I mean, if you look at it over one year, you get these plateaus, these drops, plateaus drops, which, I mean, you don't really see that in another episode. So in this beautiful chart that you're looking at, why have we not seen a bigger drop if $3 billion were wiped out for creditors with FTX? And we don't know who they are. And we don't know who they are and we don't have a sense of what the ripple effects will be. Well, to start, it's a market that's so creepy. A lot of whales keep going. The gray scale Bitcoin trust, for example, that alone, it's a $10 billion. I sell Bitcoin trust. I sell a lot of it. You tell us. Yeah, can you imagine if I revealed myself? But in any case, that controls 3.3 percent of the outstanding supply of Bitcoin. You have a lot of large holders such as that. And at this point, too, the fact that we're at $16,000 from $69,000, a lot of the sellers who would be selling the marginal seller, they're gone. They've already been flushed out. Now you're left with the true believers who lost their own real world. Seriously, who are they? I mean, is a judge going to come out and say you have to show who they are? I mean, what's our reporting on this? Well, there's a difference between someone who is now a creditor at FTX, a customer who lost money, and people who keep their Bitcoin, for example, in cold storage off these sort of hot wallets, who have them really stored on the blockchain. What is cold storage mean, Tom? It means it means a cold storage is when you're on cuckoo lake ice fishing and you put the case of Jenny Kreme in the ice. So, this is a hot wallet or virtual, it means that you don't actually hold your Bitcoin, add an exchange. You don't trust these centralized exchanges and you don't want to be a bad holder. Kitty Gratis. Thank you so much. But it's honestly, this is a really interesting question. And people have been asking this, Tom, for a long time or at least for the past couple of weeks, why have we not seen more fallout, especially in such a jittery market? Peter Schier has been writing a lot about that. Head of macro strategy at Academy Securities, and we're so glad you're actually in studio with us, which is fabulous. It is wonderful to have you on this pre-thanksgiving week. Peter, how much are you seeing some sort of, I don't know, whales and how much are you seeing something where it's a realistic pricing action of institutions having fully adopted a crypto asset, even if it does lose favor to some degree? I think we have one more big leg down in crypto. I think we're going to see some selling off in Bitcoin. I think one of the things that supported it recently are the fact that there are a lot of whales who have invested interest in keeping it higher. And there's all this talk about Bitcoin maximalist, right? So there is a theory that, OK, FTT, the tokens, that was where a lot of the trouble was. Maybe Bitcoin's the quote unquote safe part of crypto. I think that narrative is going to get her a little bit. All the stuff that's been going on with...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1515,2022-11-21 12:36:06
18902," FTT, the tokens, that was where a lot of the trouble was. Maybe Bitcoin's the quote unquote safe part of crypto. I think that narrative is gonna get her a little bit. All the stuff that's been going on with a great scale trust. So GBTC has been feeding into that a little bit. So people who I believe have been selling that to buy Bitcoin, I think that's gonna turn out to be a mistake as well. Why isn't this a broader market story? How can this be so contained? Given that this story really grew up in the era of free money. So I think earlier this year, it's a great question. But I think earlier this year, they were kind of tied together because you had a lot of people who were invested in crypto. They were invested in disruptive stocks. They all were doing it on margin. So every time one sneeze, it would drag down everything else. That got shaken out a little bit. So we're better off right now. I think the next leg of this is gonna be, wow, what happens to the economy? You start looking at the amount of money that was being spent by even FTX on advertising. Crypto as a whole. I think this is gonna feed into the economy. I think the wealth effect is real, right? This time we've lost $3 trillion down to just under a trillion, right? There's been huge wealth effects. I think this is gonna bleed into the economy. John Lee, that's gonna be bad. I think it's gonna turn out to be good for energy usage though. Peter, thanks so much for coming in. You have an August firm, hugely conservative at Academy of Securities, a former admiral's and the like as well. They hang on every bit of when cheer publishes on rates, risk, and tailor swift. How that sell. You know, we got to do some clickbait too, even in our business. So why do you sell Bitcoin to a conservative shop like Academy? These people are gonna say it's unregulated. It can't be regulated. It's foreign. How do you sell Bitcoin is a legit thing to a bunch of conservative people to Academy? So fortunately, I've been fairly negative on it, but I think we're having these conversations. Where do we step in? When does it get interesting for our firm to explore? It's really gonna come down to regulation. Do the regulators come out and create an environment that you can feel comfortable with, right? And right now it's just not there. One of my big takeaways has been for the last year, talk something as simple as where something domiciled. And where are these? Exactly. And where's the real? You and I are in the same page and this. Ali Baba is hanging out, the Cayman Islands trying to play by a different rule book. I'm gonna defend Gary Gensler here right now. What does he regulate? Where's the domicile? I think that's really the key issue, right? You've got to have some sort of domicile here. And the big question I think a lot of people are talking about even whether it's these great sale trusts is, where is the bitcoins? We talk about spot ETFs. Right? It's like how do you confirm on a daily basis that what you think you hold in the crypto world is legitimately there without maybe publishing it and exposing yourself to theft or hacking? So I think that's really the key is, most other assets you understand whether you own it, whether it's an equity, whether it's gold, you can pretty easily prove it. That's been the hard part with crypto. I think that's what's gonna have to get to the heart of regulation is how do we verify this? How do we get comfort that we are auditing something and regulating something that's actually there? Neil Cushkari has been talking about how this is just a Ponzi scheme. He doesn't really think that there's any there there here and he's been very vocal about that on Twitter and in lectures, how much is the banking industry leveraged to the Bitcoin and frankly to the crypto story not necessarily by borrowing money to invest in crypto but in building up teams of people designed to trade it, designed to invest in. I don't think the banks have really put that much effort into it. I think they're building out, but it's a small part of their business. The other part of this, I do think people made a mistake is every time some bank announced they were doing something on crypto, everyone read, oh, this is great, they're adopting it, they're adopting it. No, no, banks are very smart, right? If there's bit offered to be made, if there's some trading revenue to be made, they're gonna get involved. That's not a commitment to it. So I think banks can pull back if this doesn't work out. And to me, Bitcoin is always about adoption, the rate of adoption. When you wanna get bullish on it, you see adoption coming up. I just don't see it going up anytime soon. In fact, I see it dropping as more and more people question why they wanna be in this space. What's your call for 2023? Let's get out front of your year ahead report. You Taylor Swift into it? I'm not sure about that. I think crypto going down will be sub 10,000 on Bitcoin. You're calling sub 10,000 on Bitcoin. Definitely, I think that actually potentially happens even this year. I like rates though. I think yields are actually probably the easiest trade. I wanna be long yields right now. I think fresh reeds are gonna rally. I think the economy is rolling over. The data is rolling over. And as hockey says the Fed wants to talk, the markets are starting not to listen to it. So I love owning bonds here. Well, but we were talking to Carl Weinberg earlier and he says quantitative tightening.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1516,2022-11-21 12:40:30
18903," The data is rolling over and as hockey's just the Fed wants to talk, the markets are starting not to listen to it, so I love owning bonds here. Well, but we were talking to Carl Weinberg earlier and he says quantitative tightening. What about quantitative tightening? So to me, quantitative tightening is a little bit the opposite of quantitative easing, in fact, almost exact opposite. I find quantitative easing easier to explain. It's like if you have these new and cradle, right, where you drop this one ball and stuff shoots out at the end. So that's what happened. That shoots out and where it really exposes itself at the briskiest end of the spectrum, right? So every single person winds up having to make a choice. I have to either buy longer duration assets, riskier assets, less liquid assets, and it really comes out at the far end. That's why I think crypto did so well. All these disruptive stocks. So when it comes back in, it's not going to express itself in yields. It's going to be in the riskiest assets. I think stocks can still lag from here and it's not going to express itself regardless of what we're doing on the quantitative tightening in the bond market. Buons price up yield down stocks don't play. No, I think not. I think maybe we get a little surge in stocks after we get through this crypto debacle where people get back to comfortable, oh, lower yields is good for stocks. Then I think the reality is going to be yield to going lower because the economy has rolled over. We've done too much. We have these problems. And quantitative tightening, I think, is more impactful on equities and risk assets than bonds. I mean, never more came out Taylor Swift with Jack Attenoff in the national. I mean, what they did, Peter, during the pandemic, she just said, I'm not laying low for the pandemic. And they just created and created and created. Look at the payoff. Now, it's been phenomenal. I think one question that's been coming up directly to our businesses, what does this do for M&A activity? We've already had DC that doesn't like M&A activity. And now, all of a sudden, you've got live nation, these companies getting reported on. I think it's going to be interesting. And I think that's going to be a headwind for M&A next year. We really prepared to talk about Taylor Swift. Is that really what we're doing here? I wasn't that prepared, but I figured you know, at the time you got to be ready for anything. And so the national on what she did here acoustically was stunning. I mean, I mean, Antonoff's my hero, but you know, I'm not an expert in Taylor Swift. I will say that the controversy over some of the ticket sales is going to be something that to do. We're sawing a list of affairs moment I heard it. Boom. Are you in timeless? Are you Taylor Swift? No, I'm not actually. Peter, cheers. Thank you so much for the Academy Securities Futures. Please, you can do the data check better than you. It's like, you know, yeah, nothing happening. Turkey Schlier at 18.63. Tom's like, please tell a story because there's nothing happening. Tell a story. Well, their Nasak is on a tens of a percent. And that's actually the yen is fascinating. Dollar's stronger, yen weaker today. That's a backstory for this holiday length and work week. Please stay with us again. This is Bloomberg Surveillance. Keeping you up to date with News More Round the World with the first word. I'm Lisa Mateo. In Indonesia, at least 46 people are dead and about 700 others injured. After a 5.6 magnitude earthquake, shook the Western Java region today. Several homes, stores and public buildings are damaged and landslides are reported following the roughly seven second earthquake. Tremors were felt in nearby cities, including the capital, Jakarta. In a newspaper interview, Germany's Defense Minister says the country is offering Patriot missile defense systems to Poland. Last week, a strike killed two people in a Polish village near the Ukrainian border. Germany also intends to extend deployment of Patriot batteries in Slovakia through 2023. The UN's atomic agency says powerful blasts shook the area of Ukraine's separatia, nuclear power plant over the weekend. Former Treasury Secretary Lauren Summers warned US policymakers to focus on building the country's own economic strengths in its contest with China, rather than non-attacking its adversary. We in the United States probably need to be careful about our evangelizing influence. I don't think it's really for us to tell China how they should organize their entire society. Summers also cautioned about Washington becoming too aggressive with regard to strengthening ties with Taiwan, which Beijing resorts regards as part of its territory. In Twitter's head of France announced his departure. Damien Villal led the region for about seven years, a number of workers at the Paris office, which had fewer than 50 employees before billionaire Elon Musk took over last month, are focused on advertiser relationships.

Musk is considering additional layoffs and has already slashed Twitter's workforce in half. Global news, 24 hours a day on air and on Bloomberg Quick Take, powered by more than 2700 journalists and analysts. I'm Lisa Mateo. This is Bloomberg. What should somebody do to get into the talent agency business for the business you're in? Well hopefully what I've taught my kids. You gotta be intellectually curious. You gotta be, you gotta show up. And you know this like I know this. I got on a lot of plans. You just, yeah, even though that voice in your head is saying, oh god, I'm so tired, I don't wanna do this. You gotta show up. You gotta be charmingly relentless. You have to build emotional endurance because there's no straight line to success at the kind of all over place. And you have to just be able to work through those things. And then I think one of the things that I do every week is I try to create serendipity. No one covers the world like Bloomberg. My team thinks 2023, we avoid a recession. I'm a little more skeptical about that. China and the US both do not want to see nuclear force in the European continent. The regulators here in the Bahamas are ongoing with their investigation into ATTX. With unmatched reach in resources from more than 120 countries, the moment news breaks 24 hours a day. Bloomberg, your global business authority.

Nobody covers climate change like Bloomberg. Your global business authority. We will never break. We will never break. Build on a foundation. We will never break. We will never break. Have a wide array of things. And the mountains shake. All of them will remain. We will never. No, no. We will never. No. I still think.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1518,2022-11-21 12:48:55
18905," I still think the question about is inflation peaked in this place? Yeah, probably has. The better question is, is it going to 2% or is it going to stop at 4? Because if it stops at 4, then the Fed has not been too aggressive. I'm in the camp that's going to stop somewhere around 4 or 3.5, and that's the real problem. It's not that we've peaked, but that we're not on our way back to 2%. Jim Bianco, they're driving the conversation forward, and it's a huge debate about whether the Fed, whether it interstates. What's the consensus right now, Lisa? I don't really think I have one. The only consensus light is that long duration bonds, just as Peter Shea was saying, are going to perform all next year. That's what we're feeling. And that stocks are going to be under, and that seems to be also another feeling. And that we're going to see peaked dollar. There are some consensus forming. I'm also seeing a lot of calls that China is going to outperform just based on how much pain has already been absorbed into certain valuations. So those are some of the themes that I keep hearing. Moving to scheduled around because of the World Cup, Lisa Ramwitz and Tom King. Jonathan Farrow is waiting for England or in here in 12 minutes. And Lisa Friday, when you were with Damien Sassar, I didn't have the time up yet. Farrow hadn't sent me the time, but 2 p.m. Wall Street time. In USA, and John has selected a bar to go have the beverage of our choice. Big game. I was laughing because I'm thinking, you know, that Tom King and Lisa Ramwitz are going to lead the football coverage throughout, which really is, yeah, it pretty much does it all that side. I think Mike's helicopter almost crashed. So I've said, by that saving us in Doha, Simone Foxman joins us right now outside the stadium 30 miles north or so of Doha the other day. But today within the skyscrapers of Doha in our studio is well. Simone, let me give you an open question after what we saw yesterday. How's it going for this global event? Well, in the stadium in El Bates stadium yesterday, I think it went pretty well. Yeah, there were some growing pains. There was a lot of traffic from the cars getting there. That was one of the few stadiums not connected to the metro system. But it was a pretty impressive opening ceremony, less impressive game, Ecuador easily defeated Qatar or Tunis. But also impressive in the stands. We had the leaders of Turkey, of Egypt and the Crown Prince, Mohammed bin Salman, very closely chatting with Gianni and Fintino. I might add. Well, it's going to be interesting today. And I really go forward to tomorrow, Denmark, Tunisia, I think is a game. I'm speaking. I mean, a fair. I took notes when Ferrell called me today. France, Australia, maybe that's interesting. Where's the tension today in this first day where we really get started? It's all about England, Iran. And that kicks off in really just 10 minutes. Yeah, it does. It does. 4 p.m. local time. There are fans making their way into the stadium right now. But there is a lot of political drama on the pitch, off the pitch. Number one, we saw just a couple hours ago, FIFA tell teams that captains could not wear a rainbow-colored armband. This was something that Harry Kane of England in particular, but also some other teams really wanted to do in support of LGBTQ rights. But now FIFA's threatening, supporting sanctions, the teams telling them don't do that. But also remember, massive demonstrations going on in Iran. We are very closely watching to see how the team reacts because the team has traditionally been this hotbed of regime unity. But now a lot of Iranian fans say they don't want to celebrate given all the tragedy that they're seeing just across the Persian Gulf. Simone, what does this do for FIFA? Why is FIFA so insistent on cracking down on wearing armbands that support LGBTQ rights? You know, they are really, they've been really supportive of Qatar the whole way through recently. We heard a pretty strong speech by FIFA President Gianni Anfantino. Essentially calling out Western criticism for being racist. He said he felt discriminated against as a guy with red hair and freckles living in a foreign country and compared that to the experience.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1519,2022-11-21 12:53:18
18906," racist. He said he felt discriminated against as a guy with red hair and freckles living in a foreign country and compared that to the experience of gaze, Africans and the like. It was a little bit bizarre, but you know, I think they really want to stand behind Qatar. They've invested so much in this experience. They don't want the country to kind of continue to face this. They are trying to encourage players to play football on the field and not, you know, follow the recommendations of activists who are saying, hey, players, hey, guys, bring attention to these issues while you're there. I've never been to Doha. Simone, is it, is it bustling? I mean, what's the, I mean, is it like that walkway up towards the top stadium where it's really bustling and all that? Is it bustling or is it just so big that it's not bustling? You know, Qatar and Doha is a pretty small place, but what surprised me is it hasn't been bustling. I was out at the some of the fan zones, the fan areas yesterday and they're just, we're not a ton of people milling around. I'm going to go out there in just an hour or so and take a look once again, but you know, Qatar's worked really hard to try and limit the number of people who can come into the country. Right now you can only come in if you're a ticket holder, if you're a registered guest of a ticket holder. And that, that to prevent too much pressure on some of the infrastructure, but wouldn't it be a terrible thing if, you know, by preventing so many people from coming, you ended up with, you know, not a fun little pop? Yeah, well, that's, that certainly was an issue at the end of the Ecuador versus Qatar game. I am wondering whether we're going to see Messian Ronaldo face off. There's been one of the big questions. Argentina versus Portugal. The one thing that I do know is the legacy of these two superstars is going to be determined at this world cup. What's the latest in terms of what the likelihood is that they'll get back to. Channel your inner John Farrell. I don't know, I, you know, I have to say I'm not the best sports better in my bracket is probably entirely wrong, but certainly there are a lot of fans of, particularly from Argentina. I've seen a lot of Argentinian fans. I've seen a lot of Brazilian fans seen a handful of Portuguese fans in town. Not really the Ecuadorian fans were out in full force last night. Simone, thank you so much in Doha through December 18th. And of course, the World Cup. Well, I've covered John that for you as we can, particularly led by, I should say, John Farrell. Surveillance correction. It's good to do a correction on a slow Monday. Jimmy Males in and says, it's time you stupid idiot. You remember the turtle book. We're talking to Katie Kaminsky. Yeah. And I said there was a turtle book like everybody read it. And Jim says, wait, Richard Dennis did this years ago. And I, I remember this now. Thank you, Jim for mentioning this. It was a course. I think in New York, it was a course. You went to Richard Dennis's trend following technical trading course, which became known as turtle trading. All I know is that when you opened it, you said, here comes a turtle. Oh, please don't hang up on us. Please don't hang up on us. No, no. You call her a turtle. And yet that has been a point of pride for her this year. Oh, yeah. Because she has done absolutely phenomenally well. And you pointed out something really interesting, Tom. You said that this traditionally is to not lose as much money or just do consistently well. And this year, it has been a blowout bang up year. And how much can that continue? And how much is that really just a sort of a highlight moment that we're in, right? I'll defer to the pros on this, including Ms. Kaminsky. But to me, so much of trend following is not about making money. It's about avoiding losing money. It's a little bit different in the way so much of the media portrays it. My, you know, my long Bitcoin at 40,000, that was turtle trading. Yes, so it's the long Austrian bond. And I don't know. We still have the, we're going to be buried with the Austrian bond.

So you built a successful company but you might not want to run it for the next 10, 15, 20 years or do you and if you didn't, would you want to go into government? If the president called you to serve our country, would you go into government? Or would you start another company? I love what I do and I feel like I have this luxury with 23 me that it's and it keeps evolving. So I started out just as a consumer company worth thick and research, we got into drug discovery in 2015 and now we're getting to the delivery of care. So I've been really lucky with 23 me that it's been endlessly interesting and I'm surrounded by incredibly talented, brilliant individuals where I learn from them. And what I always advise people to do is you should take jobs where you're learning and if you stop learning in the job then you should quit and frankly when people leave 23 me like I say if you're not learning anymore you should move on. So I'm 100% committed to 23 me. That said my other passion is other direct to consumer like I want to build out a true consumer empowered healthcare world like one that is outside of the existing system and I do there's no greater force than government. Multi trillion dollar industry there's a lot of ground to cover. Come on and he's got absolutely crushed. And show you what's happening in ETFs like no one else Bloomberg ETF IQ Monday on Bloomberg.

We are in a position by 2030 to 80% of all electricity generated by wind. Global's are the safest, the cleanest and the cheapest form of energy today especially for countries such as Greece. Nobody covers climate change like Bloomberg, your global business authority. This economy is still the most resilient economy in the world. The rally could continue. I do think it is a bear market rally. I mean, you know, it could go to the end of the year. There are huge opportunities underneath the surface. It was still going to be facing a lot of volatility in 2023. Really what we're dealing here is potentially with an earnings decline that is not yet priced into the market for 2023.

Tom Keane, Lisa Branoids and Jonathan Farrow. Jonathan Farrow off on a wall deserved day off. We are looking at a day ahead of this holiday shortened week where there is a great reset and right now, Tom, that is what I'm focused on all of the year ahead outlooks. Yes. The speak of a new 2023 of a very different country. We are trying to get those slipped out now. Some of them weighed in to be fair to all the wonderful guests we have. They have to not front run what their clients would see. There's some serious regulations over that, but we can see them here in their Tony Dwyer, who's been hardcore 5, 10, 15 years linking recession to equity downturns. He calls recession. Kitty Kaminsky on earlier has been up almost 40% year to date as you put really well, Tom, that she basically has been probably the best before having surveillance guests that have had on regularly. How much has she been seeing a pivot, a new dynamic in the trend following space where suddenly the long term and the short term indicators are not sending some sort of consistent message. How much is that reflected in the outlooks in the angst that we're feeling from Wall Street right now? As you mentioned the last hour, I think we can say the call now into all of a sudden the jobs report important in December, the inflation report getting us to December 14th and the Fed meeting is there seems to be a new call bonds price up yield down by bonds. That's been basically one consensus out there a little bit of pushback around the edges and the corporate side of things we have been talking about Disney on morning. And I keep going back to this question of is this a Disney story or is this a broader okay now what story now that we're past the pandemic and now that money costs something should we go to the news here today Alex well, but I thought was brilliant quoting Peter Pan second star in the right here Disney. I mean come on. This is a big deal today chapic out. Some people are not surprised. I'll be honest I'm one of them. You know, I wouldn't like overtly say that on air. Nobody cares what my opinion is. But Mr. Eiger returns. How much is this really the comeback of activist shareholders and I ask this because you're seeing that you know you're seeing. Pelt's come in with try on taking a significant stake. How much are you going to see some others do the same thing as companies face off with the sort of painful do we have to cut jobs kind of like tech or can we hold on to people where do you prioritize just keeping this staff at a time when you saw that the real pain losing people and not being able to rehire. No, the story of China. I mean there it is again. You know. You know, are they going to be able to re-open yeah, and this is the reason why you're seeing certain stocks kind of fall off in the hope of reopening China. I don't know right now I'm seeing the biggest takeaway from the resets the sort of look ahead is that we're going to see more pain and that's been basically Morgan Stanley that's been Goldman Sachs out today with their outlook basically saying that they see sort of me underings stock performance to the same place that's right next year. Ramon Gloom. It's not Ramon Gloom. It's Goldman Sachs Bloom Gloom it's a Stanley Gloom. It's a wall speak Gloom should we do a data check today. Let's do it. You know, I mean you could start. I mean there is down. All right, I'm looking right now at NASDAQ lower by about a tens of a percent. You could see the S&P down a little bit less than that. You could see you know, not a lot of movement in terms of directionality. You could see a bit of dollar strength after a whole host of dollar weakness one or two thirty seven on the year dollar. The 10 year is interesting to me 3.825 percent. Remember we were talking about a five percent yield when we would X would see that way off and you've pointed this out the oil price. What we've seen there is interesting as well. Just are we going to slip further given WTI below $80 a barrel 79 59. That wasn't the data check I was talking about is a raging debate and this is out in the internet as well as at the key house to cook turkey at 350 or 425. It's a serious issue. I think you do both like you cook them hot first bring it down do the slow roast and then bring it up at the end. But that would just be one theory. What do you think? I think that you're not cooking this year and I think you should do it Twitter pull. I think that this president when I last called. I think that turkey OK unpopular opinion nobody ever really likes turkey. It's sort of always too much is left over there. And you end up it's always dry I'm just saying",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1522,2022-11-21 13:06:28

Before we get to David Riley, Lisa, this is important. Thank you to the telegraph here in London. Of course, it's England and Iran. It's starting right now. We'll bring it out as well. Farrell's there. He's got a cell phone out so he can tell us what's going on. But very seriously on the sidelines, Alex Scott of the BBC is wearing one of these arm bands. Interesting. And the media are sitting on the sidelines where their BBC sport microphones warbling gale about the game and about the football. But they're wearing the arm band, the players can't wear. I don't know where that goes, but that's part of the social aspect of this world. Yeah, I wonder where that's going to go in terms of FIFA and just how much pushback there comes against FIFA. Right now, we're going to turn to some of the focus on the year ahead. One of the biggest consensus calls. Go long bonds, David Riley, Chief of Vestus Stragis at Blue Bay Asset Management here to weigh in. Is this your number one as well? 10 year, 30 year, the longer the better? Yeah, I do think it's going to be a year when duration actually pays off. And it will make sense to be long duration. I'm actually more inclined to go in terms of the Treasury curve towards the five year point. And that's because I do think that it's more likely than not that the US economy goes into recession. I think we'll probably get there for get some bull steepening in the curve. Normally, you'd express that at the very short end, but we don't really know how far and how fast inflation will fall. And therefore, we don't really know at what point does the Fed start considering rate cuts. I think the five year is probably quite a good sort of sweet spot. And with that, also, it would be buying some high grade credit at this level as well. See Tom, he likes the five year auction. That's what he was just saying right there. He likes the five year. It's the only book of misforection love with these subramas. Well, thank you. David, I do wonder though, at what point you're looking at a return to the old normal, right? At this idea that we're going back to an inflation that's sub 2% or even 2%. And other people pushing back, where do you say to them, look, we're not going to have a high inflation regime for a very long time. And bonds will be able to reassert themselves in a way that we're used to. Well, because I do think that we are at or very close to the peak in inflation. And I think it's right to highlight just how much uncertainty we do have in terms of how far and how fast inflation falls. And that's obviously very critical for the Fed and other central banks. And therefore, for the outlook for the bond market. But I don't see a sort of self-fulfilling or self-perpetuating wage price viral. And if you think we're going into recession, as I think we are going into not only a European but also a US and global recession, that's very negative in all sorts of ways. And sadly, people are going to be losing their jobs on the back about that. But we know from experience that does bring inflation down. Inflation is going to be coming down. It's just about the pace and the magnitude of that through next year. David, tell me about the value of cash here. If we're quote unquote going into a recession, is cash good or is cash trash? I do think that as we go into recession, I think what is going to be of particular value is to have liquidity within portfolios. Now, some of that's going to come from having holdings of cash. But I also think it means a bias towards credit, core fixed income, which is now giving you a yield. I mean, one of the key differences, there's a lot of differences, but one of the key differences going into 2023, compared to when we went into 2022, when we went into this year, is that we're actually starting with much higher levels of yield. And that's giving you an income condition, which you otherwise wouldn't, you know, didn't have at the start of 2022. So you have some liquidity, have some cash, I think a bias towards some more liquid securities. But I don't think it's an environment. I think there are opportunities out there for you to deploy cash. I wouldn't be holding too much cash. Right. David, we need you to get back to England around.

I don't know if I'm asking you to choose amongst your children, but you know some of the most recognizable buildings by you of course the Millennium Bridge, London City Hall, the Reichstag and the Great Court British Museum. What was your favorite project to do? The Reichstag does stand out because first of all it's an energy manifesto so it transformed something that was dependent on fossil fuels it uses all the technology to produce something which is essentially carbon neutral and there's a public building that's a statement. It's a symbol of a city, it's a symbol of a nation, it incorporates works of art, it's recycling and existing building which as I mentioned earlier is the ultimate in sustainability if you can get a new life to a building. It also creates public space at the roof level, it's the most visited parliament in the world so it puts the public above the politicians who are answerable to them and that of course was made possible by the politicians so it's a demonstration of democracy in action.

18912," This is all over for the strong dollar trade. I think there's still a lot of pain to come in terms of the global economy. I think there's still a lot of percussionists yet to come and see through from the Fed. Jay Foley, Robble Bank Fair, no doubt watching England or Rand right now with John Farrow. We thank her always for her perspective as well. And Robble Bank, Lisa, has a really different approach. I say this all the time, but I think it's important. Our next guest is very, you know, speculation. How do you make money here, etc., etc. And the bottom line is, Jay Foley is working for a huge agricultural bank where it's about hedging business transactions to protect yourself. So it's the other side of the trade. You mean when derivatives actually had a concrete purpose in the world, when companies, if you're a lumberyard, you've got to actually hedge against the lumber prices going down in order to back that up. And that's really where perhaps the biggest mismatch is, particularly in oil, right? Where does the physical world, and they'll financialize world, where do they kind of coherent, where they really diverging? We're going to start strolling this week with George Saravell as global head of FX Research at Deutsche Bank. George, you're piecing it together with Dr. Fokert's Landau with Ellen Ruskin and the rest. What's your dollar theme of an outlook into 2023? Hi, good morning, Tom. It's a much more choppy and sideways outlook. I think if you take a look back this year and look at when Eurodollar made the low around 95 in September, and think about what was going on back then. The UK had a fiscal crisis. European, that gas prices were at 300. They've now come down to 100. US CPI was still accelerating. China was still falling, strict zero COVID. So you had this confluence of risk negative events all adding up together. And when we look at the biggest driver of the dollar this year, it's all been about the safe haven risk premium. So the argument we've been making in recent weeks is that risk premium in a cumulative census peak. It's just going to be very hard for everything to be as bad at the same time next year as it was this year. And as a result, the dollar has most likely peaked. But I think that's a very, very different conversation to arguing that the dollar will enter into this big downtrend. And we don't see that happening at least over the next six months. So in the first place. All right. Next. What does EM do? Where's the opportunity here in beleaguered EM currencies? So I think in an environment where the dollar is choppy, essentially what we're saying is dollar correlations can go down. It's no longer one big trade. 2022 was essentially one big trade. So everything and just own dollar cash. And if that's changing, you're an environment with a bit more differentiation in terms of stories. European growth, Europe potentially emerging from a recession. I think as soon as Q1, China potentially accelerating, you're in an environment where some currencies cannot perform in emerging markets that offer carry and real yield. And you want to be funding those longs, those high yielding currencies in things that still have very poor fundamentals. For example, the pound or the Swedish corona, which is faced with its own issues. So much more tactical and idiosyncratic year. I think compared to what has been a very, very one directional move so far in 2022. I love your bullish call on other currencies and bearish call in the dollar is. It's very hard for everything to be as bad at the same time next year as it was this year. It's not exactly a screaming buy. I'm wondering though whether the euro is going to benefit the most from this lack of conviction around just hiding out in the dollar, especially as you say if they're emerging from recession in the first quarter. So the euro can take out negative risk premium, so to speak. If you think back to what we were in September, Nat gas prices for example, are nearly two thirds down. From a growth perspective, the market expected a very sharp recession from September, October, onward, onwards, which is materializing growth is shifting down to negative. But the realities we've had are much bigger fiscal response than most people were expecting. It seems like this window for escalation around gas and the shortages it is closing. So potentially that story is looking better now. To make the argument that you're going all the way back up to 115, potentially 120, and reversing the entire move since the war, I think that's a much more aggressive argument that requires...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1526,2022-11-21 13:23:42
18913," to make the argument that you're going all the way back up to 115, potentially 120 and reversing the entire move since the war, I think that's a much more aggressive argument that requires you to be very optimistic on how the conflict goes. But can you take risk premium out as you have? Can you stay above parity? I think the answer there is yes, because the environment is just not going to be as bad as it was over the course of this year. A couple hours ago, Carl Weinberg joined us from high frequency economics and was talking about this stealth quantitative tightening that was going to take effect in the Euro region come Wednesday that about $300 billion of loans to banks would be redeemed and they would get the bonds back that backed them and that this was going to cause long-end yields to rise substantially. That people really had and understood this. What's your understanding of the quantitative tightening consequences in the Euro region? This is a response to the TLTRO repayment on Friday. They were significantly lower than consensus. They were around half the market was expecting $600 billion and we only had $300 billion of repayment. From an ECB perspective, you're actually not getting as much what's of tightening potentially as they would have hoped. We need to wait and see what the December repayment numbers are going to be as well. But either way, the point I would make on Europe is if you look at things like five-year five-year GDP-weight with real yields, they're actually not that high. If you look at the DAX, it's less than 10% down from the start of the year. Financial conditions in Europe have not tightened nearly as much as in the US. That's another reason why potentially the ECB can stay hawkish. Whether that's via more QT or via more rate hikes, it remains to be seen. That's also a story that I think could be more supportive for the Euro compared to the Fed, where we're slowly the conversation is evolving into the question of when do we get the pause? I think cutting is a very different question, but at least can we end to pause in this cycle? That's a much more valid debate to be having over 2023. George Servos, thank you so much. Really look forward to the Deutsche Bank view forward in the 2023. He is of course in London with Deutsche Bank. Lisa, I'm watching the game here. John Fero waved to me from the stands, which is great. England zero, Iran zero. What's fascinating here, you know, thank you. Thank you Steve Jobs and Tim Cook for doing this.

China and the US both do not want to see nuclear force in the European continent. The regulators here in the Bahá'uáá is our ongoing with their investigation into the United States. With unmatched reach and resources from more than 120 countries, the moment news breaks 24 hours a day. Bloomberg, your global business authority. Why do the biggest names in business choose Bloomberg? Great question. Great question. Good morning everyone. Bloomberg's of A-Lens futures will negative 20 now, negative 13.

Again, the Yannes, Sarah Velestin played up much at Doija Bank. But we had $142 a year in there, which is a weaker year in first time. I'm going to say two weeks. How much does that have to do with China and the idea that any kind of reassertion of COVID lockdowns could end up really reducing some dynamism there? Half back to the full back. Yeah, this is what you're going to be dealing with, literally another 90 minutes. Half back, half back. And I'm sure everyone's really enjoying this. We're still on air. It keeps kicking the ball back to their goalie. I didn't think that was the best. That's a classic move. Even I know that. Really, honestly, people are now throwing things at the screen.

18915," I'm really sorry. Veronica Clark looking at us. Is she football? City see Veronica. There it is. Why are we watching the game? The Internet is shot. It England's trying though. Tom? We'll have to see it. Okay. Veronica Clark was working with Andrew Hollenhorse at City group as they adjust to their call of the year. I would suggest maybe with Deutsche Bank out front first with a ramification of global slowdown and particularly the vector of interest rates higher. That's what everybody wants to know. You sit with Hollenhorse over a Starbucks coffee in the morning and you say where's the terminal rate? Where's the new city group terminal rate? Yeah. We have the terminal rate now at 525 to 550 and getting there by the May meeting of 22. Why is Bullard wrong when he talks about 7% X number of days ago? I mean, he might not be wrong. He's been kind of a leading sign for the Fed this year and I think it's fair to think that the rate needs to get to anywhere from 5 to 7. But the lag effects, not to channel a brainer here, but there is a question of how much companies are already feeling a lot of tightening and they're ratcheting back their plans for next years and Geirin may have to really cut some staff. So from your vantage point, how do you dismiss that as a relevant factor for the Fed? I think that is very relevant though. I mean, we're anecdotally hearing that people are cutting back now, but you really haven't seen it in the data yet. And that's really what's going to be most important for us, most important for the Fed is just what are you seeing in the inflation data and then also importantly the labor market data. And we still have really low initial jobless claims. It still seems the job openings are high and there's not enough loosening it. But this is the important point when you talk about tech layoffs. And we've talked extensively. We've got Amazon cutting 10,000 jobs. You have Twitter, of course, its own story. You have ometta cutting thousands of jobs. How much do you look at this and say it's a tech story and it's a tech story that could deepen, but it's tech isolated. Yeah, I mean, I think it's fair to see, you know, first the weakness in sectors like tech or real estate, of course, you know, the housing market would be most affected first by rate hikes. But eventually, you know, you probably do see it broadening out to the rest of the economy. We think we see that really know as we're getting into 2023. When you talk to your markets people, how do they link the Hollinor's Clark analysis into what the stock market will do? That is part of economics, even at New York University. Yeah, no, it absolutely does matter. And the story of the last year has been, of course, higher rates. That's tighter financial conditions, lower equities. The last couple of weeks, you know, after CPI, you know, maybe we've reversed some of that. But I still think the momentum is maybe risk assets still lower. What does investment do? Business investment next year. What, 11% of the economy, 15% of the industry. Yeah, yeah, roughly. I mean, it should be slowing. And we've already seen that, of course, in any housing related investment. That was very weak in Q3 GDP. Should be weak again in Q4. But yeah, eventually, especially given that goods demand has come off you, you should see, you know, this is pulling back less, less manufacturing activity, that type of thing. And this is a segment where we go into housing and Tom talks about how he expects. Something more significant and a lot of people are saying, yes, that seems to be the most logical conclusion from a 7% mortgage rate. And other people saying, no, because of just the behavioral aspect of this, which we were talking about earlier, people are going to stay put. There's going to be less mobility if they're fewer homes for sale. You're not going to necessarily see the realized price declines. How do you game that out in this controversial moment of really historic weakness for the housing market? Yeah, I think there is still more weakness to come. But yeah, it will matter. You know, what's happening on the supply side where, you know, you do get this pullback and construction also. And so there's less housing stock and maybe the prices don't fall as much. But we, what we have seen so far is that, you know, home sales are falling, construction falling and prices are also falling. But could you see a real route, not necessarily akin to the 2007, 2008 leverage fuels destruction, but something more significant after the bid up that we saw during the pandemic. And then the Dallas report, the Dallas Fed report that really highlights how it could spiral, especially as people get less optimistic about how much their homes are worth. Yeah, I wouldn't expect that you were in a 2008 type scenario. That was a pretty housing specific bubble that popped. But of course, housing is weak and it tends to be somewhat of a leading indicator for the rest of activity. But I think more what's happening is, you know, housing is just the first to feel the impact of Fed rate hikes. And eventually you see it in, you know, consumption that's slowing down other business investment that's slowing down people losing their jobs. But it's all.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1529,2022-11-21 13:36:49
18916," you know, housing is just the first to feel the impact of fed rate hikes. And eventually you see it in, you know, consumption that's slowing down other business investment that's slowing down people losing their jobs. But it's all coming back to that. What the Fed has done. So what's the path to December 14th? It's a sleepy Monday futures improve negative 20 out to negative 14. We're going to get Wednesday. You're cooking Thursday. Right. Do you start cooking Wednesday? Yes. Probably tomorrow even. You're going to start that that's sick. Yeah. I have a very small oven. So I need to play in these things. Yeah. OK. Well, we'll talk to Hollin or say that. I mean, I can see Ms. Clark with the Viking, you know, the big, you know, six burner bike. I'm still I'm sorry. I'm so weeding through all the hate mail that I got. Oh, it's really carrying on. But seriously here, we got a stagger to December 14th. Is this a snooze fest? Or is there actually going to be some real change in the tone as we get to December 14th? Yeah. I think it could be an interesting couple of weeks. This week is relatively slow on important data. Of course, we'll get Fed minutes on Wednesday. That November Fed meeting feels like a long time ago, but it could be an opportunity to somewhat hawkishly push back on markets. Next week, of course, we'll get a lot of labor market data. That will be very important. The payrolls number. I think it's more important just in the last week, right? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, we're really looking for, you know, I think for the Fed right now, if we do get some slowing and inflation, which it seems like we might, but you're not, you're not seeing it in the slowing and service inflation, that's related to a tight labor market. And then you do need to see that loosening in the labor market data. Okay. But you know, just want, you know, I got something I want to chat on, but I think this is really, really important. What part of the jobs report should our listeners and viewers study? Yeah. I mean, all of it matters, which is the high number. That's what Hollywood should say. Give me a value add here. Yeah. All of it matters. I think most, maybe most interesting, what I would be watching first is what happens with the unemployment rate. It did took up last month for October. If it all's back again, that's still a really tight labor market. What's the one issue that the team over at City argues about the most? Where there's the most good question. Thank you. That's a good question. I don't know. I mean, I think we're relatively in consensus. I think maybe, you know, it could be hard as we're getting into next year to know, you know, exactly what the Fed is doing when you get more of this debate between the Hawks and the Doves. And I think we do want to remember that, you know, we've been very hawkish this year, the Fed has been too. But this could be somewhat of an inherently dovish Fed. I mean, this is a Fed that cut rates three times in 2019. We might get more debate, you know, among ourselves too, just exactly, you know, how the how we play it out next year. There's going to be a discussion around the Thanksgiving table. This comes up every single year. You're Sarah with the chair. The chair is never talked to you anymore. And you're going to talk about education. You did one of the toughest grinds, mathematics and economics at Chapel Hill and then economics at NYU. How do we keep women engaged in mathematics to get them through high school and into college? I mean, I know there's a huge improvement there. But what was it that kept you engaged in mathematics? I had really great teachers in high school. And I don't, I'm not an education expert. I don't know how you improve that. But I think it does matter just having really great teachers who I struggled at points, you know, but then they, they brought me back up. Did you get through imaginary numbers like square root of minus one? Yes, yeah. I did not do complex analysis, but of course I had to do a real analysis class. Okay. Veronica Clark on the complex analysis to December 14th is, well, you nailed complex analysis to Chicago, right? Well, my father's a mathematician, so I lived it. We had lots of discussions. I got to cubic functions, you know, I nailed it all. I was like, first in the class, blah, and then cubic functions showed up. I was like, oh, really? Remember that? Yeah, I'm very lucky. Yeah, completely down analytical geometry. Then, oh, amazingly, I don't use complex analysis now in forecasting. Well, that's all I'm sure. Well, Veronica Clark, thank you so much for city group today. Lisa, what do you see here on this Monday morning? It's a quiet Monday. Look, we're not going to try to overplay the action where I do think is interesting. Actually, I keep going back to what Katie Kaminsky said. This idea that she's seeing mixed signals on the short term and the long term. And to me, that's fascinating. The other thing that's fascinating to me is to see how closely you're scrutinizing your phone right now to watch the game rather than, you know, anything else.

I mean, England came in with a corner kick and they hit the crossbar. That sounds like the end. We know and love. And then they scored a goal. I didn't see the goal because I was talking to Ms. Clark here about the Fed meeting December 14th. I was distracted by our guest. What was that about? I know, but you know, this is what people are watching. They're watching the game. The mansion. The mansion next week. Yeah, exactly. Although we're actually getting labor market data rather than this week. We're getting Fed minutes on Wednesday afternoon. I know you're going to be included. The bear is. It's serious. Seriously, I don't know where we are in time. Let's go back to Ms. Clark at this. I mean, Wednesday, you're trying to get out to cook the beast. It is like 4,000 data dump economics statistics.

But in all honesty, this is why she starts cooking now because she's got to read the Fed meeting minutes at 2 p.m. and scour the data. You look totally convinced, Tom. She skims them. I have to take your food to skim them. I have to leave. I've never slept to UCLA where you have to lean over the desk and look at the bay. I was heavily skimming.

So is there more pressure when you're trying to win a basketball championship than when you're trying to please investors? Where's the greater pressure? Oh, I think it's definitely trying to win a championship. It's hard because when you invest and you know this, when you're investing, you can control a lot more things. When in a basketball court, you can't control whether somebody's going to make a shot, you've got to get lucky. And what's the greater pleasure making five times your money on a Distress Dead investment or winning the NBA championship? They're both fabulous. I wish I could do one each year. That would be great. But I think it was a great feeling and being right on an investment that you've done a tremendous amount of work and you've made money for your clients, which I think is great. I think winning a championship is, it's a very surreal feeling because there's a whole city or state that is actually behind you. We had 70,000 people at the finals and we had them all outside. We had 17,000 in stands and then literally like 60,000 people outside. And when we won, like just the joy that you had brought to the city was phenomenal. When I started, I had no idea it was going to turn into this. It's a trix new empire. I don't have any investors. All this is all money in. This is me going out in Hustlin, bringing that money back and just building it, building it, building it. Yeah, I think about a person that was homeless at one point. I didn't really have any money coming in. The fact that this person was relentless and just determined to succeed and not let rock bottom define him as an individual. I can take things and put them together and take them apart and make them better and put them back together. I respect the craft, so I don't want to minimize and disrespect the value of each step of the craft and do by machine what should be done by hand.

18919," See, on that, for those of you watching, thank you for watching England or and England, Pulse Oy 3 0. Right now we've been watching that as we can here. Lisa Abramans with trenchant analysis is preparing for the 9 o'clock hour. I'll prepare for England and Wells this afternoon. That'll be fun. Right now, and this is not fun because it's William Cohen taking on a very difficult topic, which is power failure. And this is simply the collapse of an institution of my childhood power failure. William Cohen, thank you so much for 700 plus pages on this. My childhood was moving west on the New York State's highway by the industrial light of Jack Welch's America, the GE factory and Schenectady and all Welch coming from Pittsfield, Massachusetts as well. When did they begin to fail? Was it the financialization of a light bulb maker? Tom, you know, first of all, thank you for having me. It's great to see you again. Look, I think, you know, GE credit, which became GE capital started in the depression to help finance people's acquisition of GE products, so the appliances, etc. Jack, however, when he took it over, recognized that there was a huge arbitrage opportunity between GE's AAA credit rating and its low cost of capital. And what it could lend that money out at large spreads, including with Warren's, Tom, which was something that Mike Melkin perfected. And I started my career on Wall Street at GE capital financing leverage by now, so I actually did it myself for two years. And so Jack built that business up so that it was almost 50% of GE's profits. And he understood that business. I think he understood the risks of that business. Right. And he also had people like Gary went in charge there who understood the risks in that business. The people side of your book is absolutely phenomenal. Page 296, a guy named Bob Nardelli joins up old forage, Pennsylvania, between Wilkes Barron, Scranton. You turn the page and you've got Walter McNeerney going to New Trear and when that come, my mother went there as well. It's a people book, which is the person we should focus on when we look at the collapse of generous electric. Well, you know, it takes a village sometimes. I mean, Jeff Imilt was obviously the CEO for 17 years from 2001 to 2017. So I mean, he gets the line share of the blame. I'm afraid, you know, did Jack sort of set him up for failure? That's a question that people are wondering about and asking. How does he applied mathematician from Dartmouth screw up so bad? Did it was a single mistake that Mr. Imilt made or was he just a victim of the times? You know, I think he made a series of what he thought were the right decisions, but it turned out in retrospect to be the wrong decisions, whether it was, you know, buying all-stum, selling NBC Universal too cheaply, kind of freaking out during the 2008 financial crisis, getting out of GE capital, bringing in triumph Nelson Pellis thinking that Nelson Pellis would ratify his vision for GE and then promising earnings for share that he couldn't achieve. That was the end. I mean, it's not dissimilar to what just happened with Bob Chaypeck and Bob, I hear Disney. Well, let's rip up the script here, Bill Cohen. You can do this. I'm sure you're going to write on Iger and Disney here in five years. House of cards, money and power. Now power failure. Could this process exist today or the market so open and visible particularly to activism that we couldn't redo GE Welch to Imilt? Well, you know, GE was really a very large company when Jeff thought it would be a good idea to invite Nelson Pellis to come into the equity of GE in 2015 to ratify his decision to sell GE capital.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1533,2022-11-21 13:54:02
18920," Jeff thought it would be a good idea to invite Nelson Peltz to come into the equity of GE in 2015 to ratify his decision to sell G capital. Right. You know, that didn't have to happen. So, I mean, Dan Lowe obviously went into Disney earlier this year, spent a billion dollars, saw the stock going down 40% and moved to act. Nelson Peltz did the same thing when he saw that Jeff Imel no longer had control of the company and he did it again. Unfortunately, when you know, it was time for John Flannery to leave after 15 months. Bill Cohen, not to sell one of your textbooks. I know that's tacky in a book interview, but I've got to go to money and power. And your definitive guide to Wall Street's Goldman Sachs, your thoughts on the present state of Goldman Sachs, the market's challenges and perhaps the cultural challenge that David Solomon faces right now. What would you look forward to for Mr. Solomon and Goldman Sachs? Constantly evolving, Tom. You know this as well as anyone. Goldman is extremely nimble. David is a very clever smart guy. You know, has he made missteps? You know, of course, I mean, he tried to get the bank into more retail banking with markets and making loans and cash management. Maybe that's a tougher business than he thought. You know, his trading business had a great quarter last quarter investment banking. It's had a rough year across the street trading help Goldman trade Goldman is a perfectly designed creature to take advantage of opportunities in the financial markets. They have been doing that for 160 plus years. They will continue to do it. They are one of the oldest surviving financial institutions we have in this country. They know how to survive. I'm going to call this a Daniel Yurgen equivalent. William Cohen with this folks. Power and failure. Bill Cohen, thank you Cohen. Thank you so much. The thickness will appear you 700 plus pages of Cohen. I won't miss words. It reads like Daniel Yurgen. It just reads wonderfully supple, wonderfully fluid here from all the different people including Bob Nardelli and on and on to the collapse of this American icon. Power and failure. The rise and fall of an American icon. I really can't say enough about it here today. Futures negative 12. The tape's a little improved here and the tape is quiet. You can see on the Bloomberg launch pad, the red and the green, the way it pulsates. What kind of data is, and it's a day waiting for a lot of economic data into Tuesday. And a ton of data, as we heard from Veronica Clark on Wednesday as well. And then on to Friday and on seriously into a tumultuous December. It's going to be interesting to see where we sit on December 15th as well. Let me do a complete data check. We sort of avoided that today. My Pharaoh would have never done that. Even watching England or in Pharaoh would have done a complete data check. Futures improved negative 13. Dow futures negative 11. SPX 24 on the VIX now 23.83. A more constructive tape.

The U.S. is going to be flirting with the recession. We have probably a pretty powerful recession coming. When you have this magnitude of rate hikes in such a short period and you're also withdrawing liquidity through quantitative tightening, it's going to bite. Rages have not kept up with prices. Real incomes coming down. Thankfully it's also now starting to bite inflation. That doesn't mean that we're going to know who should go back to 2 percent. A lot depends on what the Fed does. The market is asking the Fed, are we there yet? Are we there yet? Trying to find you where is the peak of interest rate? The Fed keeps saying no, sit down in the back seat and be quiet. There are huge opportunities underneath the surface. It's still going to be face in a normal lot of volatility in 2023. Meanwhile investors hoping for a better 2023 are poised for a disappointment.

18922, So please to say that joining us right now is a Peter Oppenheimer of Goldman Sachs who penned those bearish prognostications and I am wondering from your perspective just how bearish are you why do you see this as continuing and how much further? Thanks Lisa. But I think the key point here is not that we're so bearish in terms of I think that you're going to see some more volatility and another move down. But I think that the conditions in our view that need to be in place for this staff. Peter I think that we're having some trouble with your audio so let's try to reconnect and hopefully we can get back to you maybe as we tried to reestablish the line there is this issue as we take a look at the bear market not being over Morgan Stanley agreeing and believing that there is going to be some sort of down to Morgan Stanley seeing it going potentially down to S&P down to 3000 before coming back to the hope phase joining us now to discuss how to sort of position ahead of it to maltress here J.P. Morgan's Jack Manley and Mike Katopoulos of RB advisors Mike I want to start with you and I'm really curious from your perspective with all the bearishness we haven't seen a percolate into credit is this the support of factor into next year or is this something that could potentially be problematic because it will also get hit as companies start to have to actually refinance. Lisa I think it's problematic I mean you know the credit market is kind of living in a fantasy land right now they're they're really pricing in just an ideal scenario where the economy slows just enough to bring down inflation not enough to you know dendt earnings growth or increase increase to false much and I think that's just sort of a bad hypothesis I mean you look at 2023 and it's clear we're going to go into an earnings recession you know high yield credit for example it does not do well when you go into an earnings recession it doesn't matter how strong you know balance sheets are today they're going to weaken as earnings growth slows and then of course listen you've got much higher rates and incredibly tight lending standards and that's going to improve problematic for portions of the loan market anybody who has to refinance in the next couple of years and I think sentiment's going to get dinged up pretty bad and that's not good for for broad risk assets and that really speaks to what Peter Oppenheimer was talking about and hopefully we can reconnect with him given the technology fissures but I wonder Jack from your standpoint over at JP Morgan whether you do agree that there is going to be a trough further out in the disses before we get to that capitulation after which perhaps you could get a more sustainable rally but we're not there yet yeah I mean I would certainly agree that the credit fundamentals don't really line up with with what reality is showing us I guess on the equity side of things the silver lining here the good news here if you want to if you want to be sort of optimistic about it glass half full is that well a lot of what's happened this year in fact basically everything that's happened this year has been driven by multiple compression so the good news going into 2023 from an equity market perspective is that stocks aren't expensive anymore at least not in the way that they were at the start of the year the problem of course is that that earnings shoe has not really dropped yet and the big question right now is just how bad our earnings going to be as we move through 2023 I don't think anybody is expecting good news from an earnings perspective it's really just a question of how bad it actually is but from that valuation perspective the multiple perspective Lisa that is at least one thing that's keeping me modestly optimistic about about short term equity performance potential and this this sort of tension right now between valuations being low but potential outlooks deteriorating has been highlighted by a lot of Wall Street research including Morgan Stanley's Mike Wilson who just wrote quote we still expect higher highs for this tactical rally so that's the positive before the deteriorating fundamentals that's the negative take us to lower bear markets market lows next year how much jack have we already seen though some of that disappointment blood into this last quarters results because there were a lot of disappointments and they were severely punished by the market action this whole year has been a disappointment I mean it's been an extraordinarily challenging year to be a strategist and try to figure out where things are going over the short or medium term because at every turn you are being challenged by it by something new I mean I could see another 5 10% lower on this equity market I'm not particularly optimistic about this current rally I don't really think it has legs I don't think it has a whole lot to stand on,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1536,2022-11-21 14:07:09
18923," I mean, I could see another 5-10% lower on this equity market. I'm not particularly optimistic about this current rally. I don't really think it has legs. I don't think it has a whole lot to stand on. But I do like that valuation story, Lisa. I don't want to be to be to dead horse here. But markets are off so much from where they were in January that I think if you extend your time horizon by more than 12 months and look out over 18, 24 months and beyond, the story starts to get a lot more interesting. Because 2023 may not be a great year for earnings, but 2024 probably will be a pretty decent one. And if we can get over this trouble, if the recession that is coming ends up being shorter or at least shallow in nature, I think we can look beyond the short term shop and focus in on that longer term story. Meanwhile, from the nuts and bolts of cash flow, Michael Contopolis, this has been one of the key issues for me. And I read this in your note and I thought it was fascinating. Where private markets are with respect to default rates, where private markets are with respect to companies really rethinking their ambition because it's just expensive to borrow money. It is expensive to expand. And that really gives a feeling for how long the downturn could be and how much layoffs could accelerate. What are you seeing in the private markets that arguably are more leverage than public markets and pockets? And what does that tell you about the future ahead? Yeah, Lisa, if you think about what's happened over the last 10 years, I mean, the traditional investment banks have been disintermediated from financing. The riskiest companies. I mean, that's what the post-label financial crisis regulation was meant to do is to shore up bank balance sheets. Which, by the way, it hasn't really seemed to work very much. If you go back and you look at all the hung bridge loans and deals that basically can't get off dealer balance sheets these days. But besides the point, listen, private markets stepped in to basically fill the void and financing the worst of the worst companies. And that only got worse as you had a bubble sort of percolate in the broader economy and broader markets because of infinite liquidity. And that's all about to unwind. I kind of think it's interesting that most private managers out there tout how you'll realize lower defaults because of their ability to basically shepherd a troubled company through trying times. And yet, private defaults today, by some measures, are close to 4% while public debt, which is probably the safest market that you've had in the high yield space in decades, public default rates are closer to one or one and a half percent. So it's nearly three times the default rate in the private space right now. And that goes to sort of what I was mentioning earlier. 2023 is going to be a really challenging year. I think for broad equity markets and credit markets in general. And the playbooks pretty obvious. The playbook is you have to get defensive. You don't own ill-liquid markets like private credit in these types of environments. There'll be a time for that in the future. But next year's not it. All right. Well, meanwhile, we'll get back to this and really dig a little bit further. In the meantime, on the macro phase, China COVID fears have been reemerging, worsening outbreaks over the weekend. Stoking concerns and authorities may return to tighter restrictions, blue-butt-caly lines joining us now with Mark Kaley. Well, Lisa, it's a worsening outbreak, not just in terms of total cases, but the fact that we actually have fatalities reported in China for the first time in about six months. So this is throwing a huge bucket of cold water on the whole idea that this economy was going to be reopening and these curves were going to be loosened. Now the fear is that they might be tightened once more. And that is weighing heavily on Chinese stocks. We saw that in the Asian session overnight. And that is continuing here in the US session with those ADRs under pressure. Alibaba, Baidu, BillyBillyJD.com, all down to the tune of two to five percent. Of course, JD.com, one of the big underperformers down nearly five percentage points. But of course, it had rallied 52 percent from its recent low in late October. So there was a big buildup coming into today. And that has really been true for the broader group of Chinese companies listed here in the US because of what has been a series of good news events, earnings better than expected, seeming easing of relations between the US and China. You had support for the property sector as well. And what until today seemed like it would be an easing up of COVID-0 policy. So all that together had the NASDAQ Golden Dragon China index up about 33 percent from its low in late October, but it still remains down 33 percent on the year. So it just goes to show you how far we had fallen. And then outside of equities, I want to talk about commodities as well, specifically iron ore, which is very sensitive to the China growth story in terms of demand. Because of all that reopening optimism, we have seen it have a very, very hot November, about 23 and a-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1537,2022-11-21 14:11:33
18924," specifically iron ore which is very sensitive to the China growth story in terms of demand. Because of all that reopening optimism, we have seen it have a very, very hot November, up about 23.5 percent this month giving back some of those gains today, which was actually only one of three days in the month of November thus far that we have seen these features moving lower. Obviously today that based off of the new COVID news and that news as well, part of Y Goldman Sachs cut its oil forecast for the fourth quarter. They now see Brent at $100 a barrel rather than $110 a barrel given what they see is the possibility of further lockdowns. What I will say though Lisa, that may be bad news for commodities prices if you're long could be good news on the inflation story if China's reopening is delayed further. Katie Lines, thank you so much. We mentioned Goldman Sachs and Goldman Sachs is with us, Peter Oppenheimer. We apologize to you and thank you for bearing with us through the technical difficulties. Peter from your vantage point, this has been one of the underpinnings of the recent optimism is the potential reopening of China as well as you're up avoiding the worst case scenario. How much is that going to play to the next like lower in the bear market if that optimism isn't totally founded at least to the degree that the market is pricing in? Thank you Lisa and apologies for the connection before. You're quite right. There have been some good pieces of news that markets have absorbed over the last few weeks. Times of an opening up in China as you mentioned are very mild, winter so far and Europe gas prices have fallen and of course that evidence that US inflation is reaching a peak. But we have to acknowledge that markets are really pricing that. That's not forget that the S&P for example is trading at a P-multiple at over 17 times pretty much where it was at the beginning of the year despite the fact that real interest rates have already doubled since then and we're still looking at around zero earnings growth in the US next year less in places like Europe. So I think the markets are going to be exposed to marginy any more difficult news that comes through, particularly on growth over the coming months and we don't think we yet hit the sort of conditions that we would typically see at a genuine trough in a bear market that helps to form the base for a sustained rebound. What kind of downturn are you looking for? I know that Michael Wilson over at Morgan Stanley has talked about the potential for even a 24 percent decline from here to 3000 on the S&P. Are you in line with that kind of projection? Not quite to that level, no. We're not so negative about the downsides. We just think there'll be more volatility in the trend towards a lower market level before we get that trough. The reason we're not quite so negative is because there are some positives. We do think that the US economy will avoid a hard landing. We think that there is going to be recession across Europe but even that is likely to be relatively mild and we should acknowledge that private sector balance sheets are pretty good in particular banks and broadly corporates as well but notwithstanding that valuations haven't really yet fallen to the sorts of levels you would tend to get as investors worry about an economic and a profit downturn. Also, we're likely to see further weakness and growth momentum in the next quarter or so before we really get to the nadiere, the worst point in this downturn. It's not really until we hit that that market tends to recover and I would say just fine at this point. There is a lot of optimism now that the pace of rate increases is going to slow. Essential banks get a little bit more confident that inflation is closer to a peak but that said you don't typically get markets reach your trough until interest rates actually start to come down and we're still a long way away from that. Well, and we were just speaking with Jack Manley of JPMorgan by Katopolis of RB Advisors about the fundamentals and how much free money kind of fostered what we saw and then the lack of it, the downturn and from that perspective, how much can technology shares really continue to regain leadership position and we've talked a lot about that this year but when we do get those rate cuts, will it be technology that outperforms and drives the equity indexes higher or will it be someone else or will it be a more even weighted kind of a rush? I think it's going to be a lot more even weighted but a lot more eclectic.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1538,2022-11-21 14:15:48
18925," someone else who will be more even weighted kind of a rush. I think it's going to be a lot more even weighted, a lot more eclectic. What we're really seeing this year is the reversal of the trend that we saw in the post pandemic era that was supported then by zero rates and a lot of money printing. And that really pushed up the value of the long-discuration growth stocks to towards record highs. And it's not that there's not going to be great opportunities in technology. I think there will be, but valuations still need to come down. They have been, but they still remain relatively expensive compared to the more traditional and value-oriented parts of the market, which have been out performing this year. They've seen stronger growth in earnings, but they've continued to get even cheaper. So I think that the rotation towards value that we've seen really driving the returns this year is likely to continue over the coming months. And then we'll get a bit more of a mix really between quality growth that will benefit eventually as interest rates come down. And some of the more traditional areas that will benefit from a lot more capital spending into the next cycle. Peter Oppenheimer, thank you so much for taking the time and bearing with us. Jack Manley and Mike Contopoulos will be sticking with us. Thank you to them as well. Joining us now with a look at the stocks moving ahead of the opening bell. Here's Abigail Dill. Well, Lisa, let's start out with today's big story stock. And that, of course, is Disney. Shares are shoring, in fact, heading to their best days since December of 2020, as into today heading to the worst year on records since 1975. This, of course, on the news that the board is bringing Bob Eiger back on for two years, Stint as CEO. This, after 40 years with Disney, 15 of those years, as you know, as CEO, his hand-picked replacement, Bob Shepeck is out, although I may add, with $23 million. And his goal, Eiger's is to reign in spending on programming for streaming video. Reignite growth for Disney Plus, plus bringing in a permanent replacement. As for some of the weakness that we're seeing that are dragging on futures, Kelly was talking about that zero COVID policy or the fears around COVID in China. Well, that's weighing also on the chip space. And earlier, Bitcoin was below $16,000 for Bitcoin, Lisa. That has some of the crypto stocks, including Coinbase, trading lower. Abigail, thank you so much. Coming up, the Fed speak parade continuing ahead of Wednesdays and the hits. There is more work to be done. I expect that this will require additional increases in the federal funds rate, followed by a period of holding rates at a sufficiently restrictive level for some time. That conversation coming up next on this holiday, Short and Dwayne. This is Bloomberg. We were thinking big from the beginning. I mean, the reason that I was interested in doing this in the first place was a much bigger challenge than making a comfortable shoe or doing something in the fashion industry as a narrow opportunity. We thought that there was a big leadership opportunity. We looked around at an industry where there was 20 billion pairs of sneakers made every single year. And it was 100% made from plastic and the hides from cows. And it was terrible for the environment. And we thought that we could offer something to consumers that was differentiated in the way it feels more comfortable, higher performance. And do that because we use sustainable materials. And in doing so, we could take a really interesting leadership opportunity and grab that and use that to tell a totally different story. And compete on a totally different vector than what the rest in the industry were doing. We don't want to get that over the past few weeks as made it clear.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1539,2022-11-21 14:20:00
18926," on a totally different vector than what the rest in the industry were doing. The market that over the past few weeks has made it clear it wants to go higher. It got a little spooked by the idea that geoclid will potential rise. There is more work to be done. I expect that this will require additional increases in the federal funds rate, followed by a period of holding rates at a sufficiently restrictive level for some time. The latest data have not reduced my sense of what's sufficiently restrictive may mean or my resolve to bring inflation down. The message from the Federal Reserve fairly consistent they are going to high rates. They are going to keep them at an elevated rate for longer than perhaps the market can stand it back with us to understand what that means. Jack Manley of JP Morgan as a management, Michael Contopolis of RB advisors. Jack you were talking before about how you do see long-term value. Perhaps it's not going to be in six months, but 12 months, 18 months, all of a sudden you do search to see upside for both bonds and stocks. Is there a shift though that you're seeing or you're making in terms of what the post pandemic, post distortion, post inflationary environment market looks like versus what we got used to over the past couple of decades? Yeah, at least I mean if I had to sort of sum it up in one clean sentence it's this idea that growth at any price investing is dead or at least it's dead for as long as money is not free. Given where the Fed is going, given where we expect the Fed to land, and given where we expect the long-term trajectory of interest rates to take us, I don't think money is going to be free anytime soon. I think the Fed is desperate to avoid that. But on the flip side of this, Lisa, right, it's this idea that growth at a reasonable price investing is still very much an investment philosophy that is on the table. It is still a reasonable way to approach investing right now. And so ultimately when I think about the sort of new normal post-COVID world of higher interest rates and challenged growth, we want to be looking for quality and we want to be very active as investors right now. Index-based investing I think is just not going to cut it next year or even the year beyond that. Do you think that index investing is dead, Jack? No, I don't think it's dead and I think when you look at what's gone on with multiples right now, given the fact that everything is on sales. As Peter mentioned earlier in his comments, I think there is a really nice beta tailwind that we will see in markets right now. But there is so much room for active outperformance with the right sector and security selection. Frankle with the right manager selection that it makes sense to be an active manager right now in a way that it perhaps did not over the last few years. Michael, what about an credit? You were talking about how private credit has seen perhaps an outsized number of defaults. How are we sure that the default cycle isn't going to be that deep in the public markets? How much conviction do you have around that? You know, I actually think credit is in a decent spot over the longer term. It's just sort of over the next three or six months, nine months of earnings recession takes hold and all these hikes start to be felt within the economy that they go through a rough patch. But on a whole public credit markets are actually pretty healthy. I mean, if you stress interest rates, if you stress earnings down pretty hard, they still hold up reasonably well from a historical basis. So I'm not expecting a huge default rate here. You know, a lot of the excesses have been rung out of the markets over the last several years between the global financial crisis followed by the energy crisis of 15, 16 and then of course, COVID. And so I think default rates are likely to remain relatively muted. You know, maybe get up towards six, seven percent, this cycle and contrast of past cycles, we get up to, you know, 10 percent plus spreads probably going even near a thousand basis points this cycle, but maybe go closer to, you know, 800 basis points. But that's a far cry from where we are today and the path to get to those relatively low levels of defaults and spreads is going to be still quite painful. But there's going to be a great time, Lisa, where as a credit investor and to Jack's point on",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1540,2022-11-21 14:24:30
18927," low levels of defaults in spreads is going to be still quite painful. But there's going to be a great time, Lisa, where as a credit investor into Jack's point on active management, there's going to be a great time to go from interest rate risk to credit risk. That may happen, you know, sometime early next year or by even mid or third quarter next year. Michael Contopolis, Jack Manley, both of you, thank you so much for taking the time. Happy Thanksgiving. And we will continue this conversation. Coming up, the morning calls and later Sylvia Jablonski of Defiance ETFs, staying the course amid investor pessimism, that conversation still ahead. And this just outprint crude falling below $85 for the first time since the end of September, perhaps on the China COVID shutdown, kinds of discussions from New York. This is Bloomberg. Most of us don't spend much time thinking about the grid. The dizzyingly huge system of cables, transformers and outlets that reliably powers our lives. It's an easily ignored, change resistant part of the modern world and that's the way we like it. But as we move towards less planet melting ways of producing electricity, the grid is going to have to evolve too. We are seeing so many countries and governments announcing high targets when it comes to decarbonisation and being climate neutral. But this is just one side of the coin. It's not enough to simply generate green energy. We also need to make sure that this transmitted and distributed to the end consumers. The grid of the day just isn't equipped for renewables. So a new kind of grid is starting to take shape. The super grid. When innovation strikes, Bloomberg technology is there with the news and analysis unique. Every weekday only on Bloomberg. I'm Lisa Abramway, I'm from Jonathan Farrow. We are seeing a bit of a down in stocks and we are seeing oil prices go down time now for some of the morning calls. We will look at some of the analyst recommendations on Wall Street this morning. The company will struggle to make a profit as used car prices continue dropping. Next up, SouthJow and downgrading Connico Phillips to sell seeing a little upside with shares trading at current levels. And finally, Moffit Nathas in upgrading Disney to outperforming following the management shifts.

18928," China's military power has been growing at an incredible speed over the last 20 years. A strong country must have a strong military, as only then can it guarantee the security of the nation. In terms of sphere of influence, we absolutely know that China wants to be dominant in Asia, so there is a target to get to that point, to be a military that is appear to the greatest militaries in the world by 2035. The competition for influence is a global one, and through a multi-decade trajectory fueled by planning, money, and pragmatism, China is building a military that allows it to shape the 21st century just as the US shaped the 20th. The top names in climate change are on Bloomberg. Building out local wind, local solar, hydrogen, these are solutions to not just climate issues but geopolitical issues. We are in a position by 2030 to 80 percent of all electricity generated by wind. The renewables are the safest, the cleanest, and the cheapest form of energy today, especially for countries such as Greece. Nobody covers climate change like Bloomberg, your global business authority. This is Bloomberg Daybreak, but thanks. Welcome to Bloomberg Crypto. This is countdown to the opening. From the opening bell, we could see that negative tone, actually getting a little bit lesser of a negative as time goes on, Nasdaq down about a half a percent. The S&P down about a third of one percent you're seeing yields a little bit lower on the front end. Difficult to really get a sense in this holiday short and week. I will say, though, Brent Crude falling below $85 a barrel for the first time going back to September. You're seeing that play out in WTI down to 76, 83 down about 4 percent today in the initial mimics of the opening bell. The dollar, a little bit of dollar strength, a verse in the dollar, weakness, one or two 51 for the Euro versus the dollar. Joining us now with a look at the stocks moving at the opening bell, here's Abigail D'Soulle. Well, Lisa, as a result of that oil weakness, we do have energy as the worst sector on the day. We'll be taking a look at one of those individual movers in a moment. But first, let's return to Disney because these shares are soaring the best days since December of 2020. This, of course, as Bob Eiger comes back in as CEO, Bob Shepeck is out, although I may add, with $23 million. And Eiger's new task really is to rein in spending and programming for the streaming video, plus reignite the growth for Disney Plus, and find another new replacement, one who hopefully works out for a bit longer. This stock I might add into today had been on piece where it's worst year going all the way back to 1975, the worst year ever. As far as some of the other movers on the day, of course, with stocks down, we do have a number of lagers, including Amazon. Actually, Amazon has flipped higher up, 9.10 of 1 percent really showing you that the interday volatility that we've had all year is continuing. But this company, of course, has Black Friday either worry about or who knows, maybe it will be a boon for them. Connico Phillips, though, on oil falling, Brent Crude, as you were mentioning below $85 per barrel, down about 3 percent. U.S. steel also down 1 percent. This, of course, has to do with the COVID fears out of China. Lisa China is the world's largest user of natural resources. So we have a lot of these materials and energy stocks down. And then Coinbase Global, it is off of its pre-market lows, but nonetheless down 1.4 percent earlier, as you know, Bitcoin back below $16,000 per Bitcoin. And, of course, still lots of questions and fear around the extent of the F.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1542,2022-11-21 14:33:05
18929," There's a per-bick win and of course still lots of questions and fear around the extent of the FTX bankruptcy and the fraud. What will it mean that crisis and confidence for crypto? Abigail, thank you so much. Sticking with Disney, a chair of the board, Susan Arnold, writing quote, we concluded that it's Disney embarks on an increasingly complex period of industry transformation. Bob Eiger is uniquely situated to lead the company through this pivotal period. Bloomberg's head-loaded low joining us right now with more. Ed. Good morning, Lisa. He's situated because he spent four decades at the company, 15 years as CEO. Many investors are most on the sell side of cheering this. You see that in the stock reaction though. It is surprising. Che Peck only extended his contract by a three-year period in July and it was less than a year ago that Eiger had retired from the executive chairman role. The big focus is the streaming business. The streaming losses for fiscal 22 were $4.5 billion, almost double what the company outlined. It expected them to be at the beginning of fiscal 22. The problem is outlined in that chart that the losses from the streaming business are outpacing the growth in revenue on the direct to consumer business. There is some feeling on the sell side at least that Che Peck was not as focused or as ruthless on the bottom line as he could be in Eiger coming back. We'll have that focus. His remit, as Abby said, is two years as CEO with a drive of new strategy while trying to seek a success of it. Times are challenging. The stock down more than 40% year to date on track for its worst annual decline since the 70s. The macro picture is changed, of course, but so has the industry and the environment for streaming. They've hung their hat on the streaming business. The problem is business needs to be profitable and there's a feeling actually Eiger is the man to fix that. Bloomberg's head, Ludlow, thank you so much for that. Both Goldman and Morgan Stanley, expecting a challenging year ahead for stocks. Morgan Stanley's Mike Wilson reiterating his view this morning, writing quote, what's yet to be priced is the earnings risk. And that is what ultimately will serve as the catalyst for the market to make new price lows in the first quarter. Bloomberg's Kelly lines joining us now. Kaylee, what do you see? Well, it may not be whole new year, new me thing for the equity market, Lisa. If you listen not just to Morgan Stanley, but Goldman Sachs as well, which says the bear market is likely to persist through the duration of next year, they essentially think that at the end of 2023, we're going to be around 4,000, which is not much change from where we are now. Goldman says the conditions typically consistent with an equity trough just have not yet been reached. And therefore the recent gains we've seen aren't sustainable because stocks don't typically recover from troughs until you see the rate of deterioration and economic and earnings growth start to slow down. Now, Goldman's view isn't really far off from the consensus call for next year. At this point, the average strategy's target in this month's survey has the index down at 3931 come end of 2023, although it's pretty telling that's already 3% lower than they saw in the initial 2023 survey back in October. But clearly the broad consensus is we won't be much change, which echoes the view of Michael and Morgan Stanley, which you mentioned reiterating today that he thinks we will end next year near the current level, but it will be a bumpy ride to get there. He thinks will fall as low as 3000 in the first quarter, which would be 24% drop from Friday's close. As for what history suggests about whether a bearish call like that may actually come to fruition, the average peak to drop decline for the S&P 500 over the last 50 years of recession history has been about 37%. We were down 25% this time around before the recent rally on that cooler inflation data. So there's a 12 percentage point gap there from the norm that could lend support to the idea that this bottom is not yet in Lisa. Blumberg's killer lines, thank you so much. So bearish that it becomes bullish. Divide CTF, Sylvia Gibonsky, seeing signs of a trough writing quote, stay the course. Invest for the future when people are this pessimistic and doomsday driven, it's likely a sign we are potting out. I am pleased to say Sylvia joins us now. So how strong is that conviction that you feel like, alright, people are so gloomy, so do me. That's an screaming buy signal. Hi, Lisa, so I don't think that it's necessarily a screaming buy signal in terms of a short term, you know, turn around and major profit opportunity. But I do think that the market is going to kind of stay where it is. And even with the most bearish analyst that you just referenced, Michael, Sid and Goldman Sacks talking about 4,000, that means that we get range bound volatility, probably.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1543,2022-11-21 14:37:35
18930," the market is going to kind even with the most bearish reference michael said in about four thousand that around volatility probably then. So you're going to perhaps the short term opportun but the market is unlikely you know further out for t I think in terms of this opportunity to dollar cost investors who have time b 2023 because we talked o haven't happened to really in terms of earnings pulling 30% 37% moving that S&P but what we're really also perhaps the positive things that could happen so if inflation has peaked and it continues a downward trajectory and doesn't get stuck at three to four percent that's a positive if China reopens and covid becomes a thing of the past. We keep sort of saying that but it's still in our world and our ecosystem here. That will be a positive for markets. We need a catalyst in either the market or the market is a positive. We need a lot of investors off of the sidelines but in the short term, you know, I do think you can pick your spots for the longer term names like tech semicondu I mean they are so far off 52 week highs that I just strongly believe that there's dollar cost average in opportunities in those types of names. One thing that defines ETFs does so well is thematic investing and that's really one of the main spots for ETFs at this point when a lot of people are casting doubt on indexes in the face of the tech weakness. How much has tech clouded some of the valuation that's been made for other sectors that are being reflected into inflows into certain thematic ETFs that you oversee? So that's a great question. I think the performance of tech has just led to this contagion in terms of any kind of higher growth innovative thematic ETF type of product. It's sort of shown up with crypto crypto has obviously gotten worse because of the FTX in recent days but anything that sort of high growth and risk makes sense because interest rates are a lot higher. We have a hawkish fed of slower growth in the near term. So investors tend to pull back in those scenarios but interestingly enough, we've started to see inflows into the funds in recent weeks which leads us to believe that a lot of the sort of buyers and investors out there are thinking, OK, 5G for example, we need 5G to communicate to connect role in urban America for electric vehicles, artificial intelligence and and semiconductors are, you know, just notoriously hammered this year. Perhaps we are at a low in certain areas like that and then that feeds the theme of sort of things like quantum competing 5G data learning. So you do see some bottom picking out there in mathematics and then the mathematics in different areas. For example, alternative energy, for example, are seeing great inflows. So we have a lot of interest in hydrogen, for example, and we're seeing investors looking to diversify their portfolio exposure in that way by picking up, you know, ETFs and single name stocks in that space. So how much Sylvia, you mentioned Bitcoin and I know that defines ETFs also has some short Bitcoin and short crypto ETFs. And I'm wondering from your perspective, do you have any insight into why there hasn't been broader fallout? We were just speaking with Peter Sheer earlier this morning and he was talking about the possibility of Bitcoin going below $10,000. I mean, how much is this something that you're seeing as a theme among the retailers and the institutions that use your funds? So the way that we approach yours, we look at companies that are related to the blockchain digital asset ecosystem. So not crypto or digital asset ecosystem. So not crypto itself, but names like micro strategy that hold a lot of crypto or coin base that are impacted by crypto block galaxy, things like that. So these names are actually negatively impacted by crypto falling from 70,000 down to, you know, 16,000 where we are now and perhaps if it goes to 10. So you might see a bid in shorting a lot of those types of names, whether through an ETF or individually, if crypto continues to fall. In terms of the broader market, though, you know, I think it's sort of a good thing that, you know, the sort of crash of RTX isn't impacted by the RTX isn't impacting Apple, for example, right? So it is this sort of unique discreet asset class. And I think, look, you'll have traders that play both sides of this, right? I think a lot of investors strongly believe in a long-term future of blockchain technology. And so they'll scoop up some Bitcoin here because it'll be a payment method for Web3 and, you know, the build that of sort of all that. But in the near term, it's like any other short fund, right? When the market is falling and you have an opportunity to come, you know, falling prices of stocks that relate to crypto investors love it. Sylvia Jablonsky, thank you so much and happy Thanksgiving.

18931," you know, falling prices of stocks that relate to crypto, investors love it. Sylvia Jablonsky, thank you so much and happy Thanksgiving. Coming up, high towers, Patrick Frezetti, expecting more clarity around inflation to come next summer. Net more on that next from New York. This is Bloomberg. Here goes the last one........................................... This is Bloomberg at Markets, the open at taking a look at the Fed speak this week. The Fed's calling seeing another 75 basis point move on the table. Atlanta Fed president Rafael Bostic taking a less hawkish stance that his colleagues saying over the weekend, quote, assuming the economy evolves as I expect in the coming weeks, I would be comfortable starting the move away from 75 basis point increases at the next meeting. Joining us now, I'm so pleased to say is Bloomberg's Michael McCabe. Mike? Well, Lisa, this is the week of the Fed minutes and a lot of people are going to be paying attention to that, but you probably don't need to and here's why. The minutes reflect what the Fed was thinking back on November 2nd. And since then, as Lisa was just noting, an awful lot of Fed officials have been speaking. Six of the 12 who will vote have said they're willing to step down from 75 to 50 if that's what the chair.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1545,2022-11-21 14:46:19
18932," They're willing to step down from 75 to 50 if that's what the chairman would like. The chairman says so as well. And six more of the members of the 19 members of the committee have also said the same thing. Most of the rest have not spoken. And Collins didn't say she wants 75. She just says it's on the table. So what is a three week old set of minutes going to tell us? Not a whole lot. Most of these fed people have been saying they're still data dependent. They want to leave themselves with lots of room to make decisions based on the data and a lot of data out this week because we're compressing it all ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday. Daily, Mr. George and Bullard, who've all taken a position speaking this week, that Wednesday's the big day probably want to look at jobless claims and the Michigan sentiment numbers about the idea of whether or not people think inflation in expectations are going up. Then we've got those minutes. But the big news is going to be next week on the 30th on Wednesday. J. Powell is going to be speaking at the Brookings institution and he's going to be quizzed on monetary policy. So I think the minutes this Wednesday are probably not going to mean a whole lot. If you've got J. Powell two days ahead of the fed blackout telling us what he thinks should happen and is likely to happen. So Lisa will keep an eye on that. That doesn't mean we will carry the minutes or cover them. I'll be there. But sure. But this week may not be as important as next week. Michael McKee, thank you very much. I do want to bring you this. Within the past 10 minutes, the Wall Street Journal has been reporting that Saudi Arabian other OPEC oil producers are talking about actually increasing production of their output, increasing their output. And part of this could heal the issue that's come up with the Biden administration and also come ahead of additional sanctions on Russian oil. Some people speculating this is what's behind some of the declines that we've seen in crude prices with Brent falling below $85 a barrel for the first time since September. Meanwhile, we do have this feeling right now in markets that there is this disinflationary force. Perhaps this will add to it and joining us to really parse through that as Patrick Frisetti of high tower right now. Patrick, thank you so much for being with us. How much are you seeing this disinflationary kind of move being born out in the coming of the commodity sector on the heels of the expectation of weakness? You know, we've seen it now, I think, all year. I mean, the thing that I think the market doesn't totally appreciate yet is that no inflation is so pervasive that I don't see it going away anytime soon. I don't see us getting to a 3% inflation rate next year. I think this is going to be with us for years. And why that's important is, again, inflation and energy and consumer services, etc. As that ripples through, you're going to see markets, I think, continue to rotate. And what that means is we've had this change of leadership this year. We've seen it in commodities, yes. But we're going to continue to see that, I think, for the coming years. And so what worked over the past 10 years, I don't think it's going to work in an inflationary environment. You know, the Fed has been very consistent in terms of, you know, again, you know, saying that perhaps that the pace of rate increase will go down, but the terminal rate will be higher. I think we're going to be stuck with this inflation issue for quite some time. So how do you deal with the fact that you're seeing OPEC-plus respond perhaps, increasing their output, at least if this Wall Street Journal report is accurate, the does cite sources, Patrick, how much do you sort of double down on your overweight of energy stocks, which we've seen out for four more years, even in the face of the countermeasures that are being taken around the world? Take it and stride. You know, I mean, this, you know, this is a long, you know, a long-term move. And so these were always opportunities, you know, to add exposure. You know, if you're underway right now, I definitely feel like, you know, the energy market, again, that rotation. You know, you see just being such a small percentage of the overall market, you know, up until, you know, this year and it's still very, you know, relatively small. I think it's always an opportunity to use this volatility, you know, on days like this. Although we are seeing people say, OK, some of the areas that have gotten bit up most aren't necessarily going to look the most attractive.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1546,2022-11-21 14:50:47
18933," to use this volatility, you know, on days like this. Although we are seeing people say, okay, some of the areas that have gotten bit up most aren't necessarily going to look the most attractive in the next leg, simply from a valuation perspective, because we have seen such incredible valuation resets in certain areas. Is there anywhere in that space where you're starting to see something that's a little bit more attractive despite your hesitation in the face of further inflation? Well, you know, look, you know, I would say in one area, you know, say take media, for example, right? There's been such a divergence between valuations over the past couple of years with streaming, you know, Disney obviously is at the forefront today and I heard coming back into the fold, right? But when I look at media assets today, you know, you're going to see, again, the corrections, you know, continue to come through that space and I think there could be, you know, very good opportunities within that space. We have some exposure there. Again, it's sort of the value side of the equation when you look a part of the industry and I think the growth side of the equation, you know, at the other end of the spectrum. And of course, when you have, you know, news coming out every day and, you know, again, competition, I would say among technology, I think that's very important thing to pay attention to. So given that you do see the inflation lasting a bit longer than people can stand it and given the fact that city group is talking about a five and a quarter to five and a half percent fed funds rate, how much can you use bonds as the same kind of buffer given that people are expecting a downturn. People do expect longer term things to reset back into some kind of normalcy that we've known. I think bonds are a good compliment for any portfolio right now. I mean, there is now competition for, you know, the equity space and that's in bonds and you can get a return with, you know, I'd say at least on the short end with, you know, relatively low volatility and I think to have some exposure in bonds, I think for sure that's, you know, a part of any asset allocation, particularly, you know, when you're looking a few years out and so again, it's because we haven't had these rates, you know, for 12 years plus. And so that is something you really have to pay attention to and really pay attention to when it comes to valuation of stocks, right? The discount rate has now gone up, right? And so now we see these valuations on the long end, particularly with these high growth companies face massive corrections. And I still don't think we're done when it comes to some of those, you know, previously high growth names in terms of correcting. What will be the all clear signal for you, Patrick, to go in and start being more aggressive? So, you know, we look at signals all the time. I think, you know, frankly, you know, I said before that inflation is not going away. That's because the labor market is so strong, companies still have a lot of pricing power, right? So when I start to hear companies, you know, perhaps not having as much pricing power or again, unemployment sort of only over, you start to see that move up significantly. Then perhaps, you know, I'd see those signals where, okay, valuations have sort of reset and bottomed out and we can add more exposure. But, you know, I don't traffic in the index fund world, you know, a traffic in individual stocks. And so I like to, you know, do sort of the, you know, the deep work with my research staff and create a portfolio that we think will, you know, protect our clients and grow the long term and take sort of a, you know, three to five year view. Patrick Fruzetti, thank you so much for being with us. Let's take a look some of the sector price action this morning and head over to Bloomberg's Abigail. Do you little Abigail? What do you see? Well, Lisa, you know, at this point, we're looking at a very small decline for the S&P 500 on extremely low volume. Most sectors are higher, but let's really hone in on energy down 3.4%. Of course, you were talking about that report of the Wall Street Journal that Saudi Arabia is discussing a possible OPEC increase. Brent crude below 75 WTI crude lease at its lowest level of the year. In fact, it's now breaking down. The question is, will that be good relative to inflation or is that going to be a commodity collapse that will at some point weigh on stocks? We, of course, have the China news. COVID really weighing on the natural resources. Abigail, thank you so much. Coming up, the market moving events that you need to be watching that's next in our trading diary in the markets you are seeing.

18935," This was a much bigger challenge than making a comfortable shoe or doing something in the fashion industry as a narrow opportunity. We thought that there was a big leadership opportunity. We looked around at an industry where there was 20 billion pairs of sneakers made every single year. And it was 100% made from plastic and the hides from cows. And it was terrible for the environment. And we thought that we could offer something to consumers that was differentiated in the way it feels more comfortable, higher performance. And do that because we used sustainable materials. And in doing so, we could take a really interesting leadership opportunity and grab that and use that to tell a totally different story and compete on a totally different vector than what the rest in the industry were doing. So you've got to explain this one to me. What does it mean when the White House says we're watching markets carefully? It means they have a Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen it. I've seen it. I've seen it. I've seen it. What does it mean? What does it mean? What does it mean? What does it mean? It means they have a Bloomberg. Pepsi's number fever campaign in the Philippines has probably gone down in history as one of the biggest marketing disasters in history, mainly because of a human error that led Pepsi to print more winning caps than they planned. The resulting chaos caused riots, civil unrest, and even deaths. Reporting this story took over a year and it resulted in me flying to Manila in the Philippines to meet unlucky winners and to find out exactly what happened back then in the 1990s. My name is Jeff Mesh. I'm a journalist based in Los Angeles. I wrote the story for Bloomberg Business Week about Pepsi's number fever campaign. The Philippines is a really interesting country. It's made up of thousands of islands and it's also a country that's very heavily influenced by America. America and culture is everywhere you look in the Philippines. They're obsessed with Frank Sinatra music, for example. They love all things America and that extends to their love for soft drinks. Pepsi Cola, Coca Cola. In the 1990s it was everywhere. Pepsi and Coca Cola were embroiled in what is now known as the Cola Wars. It was a fierce battle for market dominance. Number fever was already a really popular promotion. It had been rolled out in America to great success. And so Pepsi decided to roll it out internationally, particularly in Asia. They thought it was the answer to their problems. They thought it could finally help them beat their biggest competitor. Look for the winning number in Thai Thai for a 7-day Alfonk TV Reunion Youth Cooper. You could be a millionaire. A million pesos or $68,000 doesn't sound like a lot now. But in 1992 that was a phenomenal amount of money. You've got to remember that in the Philippines at the time the average monthly income was about $100. So a million pesos was wealth beyond anyone's wildest imaginations. Number fever caught fire in the Philippines. Kids were saving up their pocket money to buy a bottle of Pepsi.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1549,2022-11-21 15:03:28
18936," and anyone's wildest imagination is. Number fever caught fire in the Philippines. Kids were saving up their pocket money to buy a bottle of Pepsi. Parents were spiraling away all of the bottle caps in bags. You would walk down the street and people were going through trash trying to find discarded bottle caps. It was a national phenomenon. Pepsi boasted that half the population of the Philippines was playing it. Number fever boosted Pepsi sales every month from $10 million to $14 million. It had a huge impact on Pepsi's bottom line. Number fever quickly became number hysteria. Mades were being jailed for stealing their employer's winning bottle caps. There was even some murders over winning bottle caps. People were fighting in the streets over these caps. There were signs that there were going to be problems with number fever very early. Pepsi had rolled out the competition in Chile and a garbled fax had caused some kind of problem with the winning number. They'd announced the wrong one in Chile causing riots. There were signs that there could be big problems ahead if they didn't keep their eye on the ball. So in 1992 Pepsi decided to extend the campaign in the Philippines and they announced that the competition would go on for a few more weeks. One night on the television news, they announced the latest winning number. Three, four, nine. The problem was three, four, nine had already been allocated as a non-winning number in earlier campaigns. So there were literally hundreds of thousands of bottle caps with three, four, nine. Just floating around the Philippines. Hundreds of thousands of people all across the Philippines, thousands of islands were finding winning bottle caps. Three, four, nine. Three, four, nine. Some people had ten lucky three, four, nine bottle caps. People were dancing in the streets celebrating. They thought their problems were over. They were millionaires. It's still not certain exactly how many winners there were of lucky three, four, nine bottle caps. But we know that Pepsi printed over 600,000 of them. Pepsi realized very early that there was a problem. Hundreds of people started arriving at their bottling plants with their lucky bottle caps. They realized something was seriously wrong. Pepsi tried to solve the problem by offering a small token donation to anyone that brought a lucky bottle cap to their bottling plant. But it wasn't enough. People didn't want just a handful of pesos. People wanted their million pesos prize. Within a year, violent protests and riots outside Pepsi factories would leave dozens injured and five people dead. At one Pepsi factory in the Philippines, a grenade was thrown through the window. It killed three Pepsi employees. Anacita Rosario was a schoolteacher living near Manila in the Philippines. She was one of the tragic victims of this whole thing. She was walking to a nearby store to buy some rice one day when a Molotov cocktail was thrown at a Pepsi truck in a violent protest. It bounced under the truck and exploded. It killed her and an innocent bystander who was just a child and injured many others. When I was in the Philippines, I tracked down Anacita's daughter Cindy and her husband, Raoul. It was clear to me that they were still very upset by the whole thing. You know, a family had been ripped apart by this competition. And Raoul told me that he'd never remarried. He told me that he'd gone to meet Pepsi executives after his wife was killed. And he was angry. He said to them, you know, this wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for you, if it wasn't for number fever. The biggest revelation from my reporting was rumors that Pepsi was somehow involved in",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1550,2022-11-21 15:07:50
18937," The biggest revelation from my reporting was rumors that Pepsi was somehow involved in bombing their own trucks. I found a newspaper report with a headline that said Pepsi goons bombed their own trucks. And when I visited the MBI, the police department in the Philippines, they presented me with documents and interviews with people who claimed that Pepsi had paid them to cause riots and to cause trouble outside their plants. In order to destabilise the situation and to frame the owners of the coalitions that were fighting them to try and curry favour, I just thought that was so shocking and of course Pepsi denied it, but help us are that a company would be accused of bombing their own trucks. The contest had sparked so much anger in the Philippines because it landed at just this really weird time in the Philippines history. It was during a crazy election that was racked with allegations of fraud. The Philippines was in a kind of love-hate relationship with America. They loved obviously the American aid and finances that was pouring into the country, but at the same time they yearned for independence. They wanted to be their own country. Vicente Del Fiero was a local preacher living in Manila and he hated the number fever campaign. Del Fiero thought Pepsi's number fever campaign was just one of the many ways that America was asserting its dominance over a third world country. He hated seeing his fellow countrymen get ripped off in his eyes by this huge multinational American company. He wanted justice. Del Fiero rounded up over 800 winners of 349 bottle caps and he got them all together to sue Pepsi for over $400 million to be divided between those holders of lucky bottle caps. Del Fiero took money from some of the people who could afford it. They paid him 500 pesos to help with legal fees, but for people who couldn't afford the money he would just represent them pro bono. He flew to America and he hired two consumer lawyers here in America to take on Pepsi. He had a meeting at Pepsi's headquarters to try and resolve the problem, but he said he wanted to take it all the way to the highest courts in America. When those cases were heard in America those courts decided that this was a problem that should be heard in the Philippines, not in America. Back in the Philippines Del Fiero continued his case in the Filipino courts. At one stage there were arrest warrant's handed out for 9 Pepsi Cola executives, which he saw as a big victory. We don't know if those arrest warrant were ever upheld, but it made newspaper headlines across the country. Pepsi did not take kindly to Del Fiero's campaign. They tried everything to shut him down. They sued him for libel. My father had to attend three times a month for a branch 1.45, and another heating for the branch 1.30, also three times a month. Also, there was a time my father's hospital to do heart failure. Still he had to attend the two branch heating of otherwise for not attending the judge will issue water to the next one. My father passed away in 2013-2010 after staying for almost one year in the hospital. He died of complications due to heart failure. During the death of my father, I was inspired to do the website.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1551,2022-11-21 15:12:12
18938," One year in the hospital, he died of complications with a heart failure. After the death of my father, I was inspired to do the website. Pepsicle will be remembered for what they did to the consumer in the Philippines and to my father. When I reached out to Pepsi for comment for this story, they claimed that they didn't have access to anyone who was working at Pepsi that was around in those days. They also said that during COVID-19, they didn't have access to their documents about this, but they were very careful to say that they were sorry for everything that happened, and we do know that Pepsi did try everything to try and make this right. The Pepsi number fever disaster cost the company millions. We know that they paid up to ten million dollars in those good-will payments, but the financial effect could be much greater. After the disaster, we know that Pepsi sales dipped. They were overtaken by Coca-Cola again. Pepsi's number fever disaster changed the legacy of that soft drink in the Philippines forever. Some people of certain age won't touch it. For many people, Pepsi is a taboo word. A lot of the people that I spoke to were still quite traumatized by their experience, by that experience of winning a million pesos, losing it and then returning to their normal life in poverty in Manila. The news of the bombing came out. It was a massive story in Germany. We are following some breaking news coming to us out of Dortmund in Germany. It was covered by all the media outlets. Three roadside explosions triggered at the same time last night, as the coach left its hotel in the south of Dortmund. Public figures commented on it. We should not let them affect our life wherever it was. The media echo went far beyond Dortmund. I think it was front page news in every single big paper around Europe. Everyone thought it was a terrorist attack and people were scared that throughout the city and Dortmund there was more attacks to be happening. Unbeknownst to investigators just after the bomb went off and the players of the team were shell shocked. The person who had mastered the attack was actually sitting in the hotel, eating steak and sweet potatoes. My name is Thomas Rogers. I'm the journalist who wrote the article, The Get Rich Quick Scheme, that nearly killed a German soccer team. Dortmund is a mid-sized city in the western part of Germany in the state called North Rhine, Westphalia. And it's a former industrial city that's kind of fallen on hard times in the last few decades. It was severely bombed in the war. So the center of the city is quite stark. Some of the few high points include its soccer team. My name is Aikening. I'm a reporter with Bloomberg News and I'm a great fan of Borussia Dortmund. Dortmund fans are super loyal. On all matchdays the entire city is in black and yellow. It's like a religion. I think more than most German cities, soccer does play a very large role in the identity of Dortmund.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1552,2022-11-21 15:16:30
18939," I think more than most German cities, soccer does play a very large role in the identity of Dortmund. In October of 2000, the BBB became the first team in the Bundesliga to actually go public. The salaries for soccer players in the Bundesliga have gone up very dramatically. With such high prices they thought that by going public they would be able to compete better with big teams like Bayern Munich. Unfortunately that didn't go too well, Dortmund bought too many expensive players, high wages and the club almost went bust in 2005. The price of their shares, it has sometimes gone up but mostly gone down since they made that decision. So on April 11th, 2017, the team was staying in a hotel on the outskirts of Dortmund. Match days are always special in Dortmund, everyone is looking forward to it. The team always meets in the same hotel ahead of matches. They stayed in the hotel in order to have a kind of neutral space before games so that they could concentrate, be isolated from distractions, things like that. Everyone was pretty optimistic there to chance to go really far, maybe into the finals. I was in the office and getting ready for match day was going to meet with a friend, a fellow Dortmund supporter in a pub. As always the fans are very excited about matches. On that day they were heading to play in the quarter final against AS Monaco at Signal Idunas Stadium, which is in the centre of Dortmund. Shortly before 7pm the players of the team boarded their official team bus. When the bus took off the parking lot of the hotel and turned on the street there were three detonations, three bombs that exploded and hit the bus off Dortmund. Three explosions occurred close to the Borussia Dortmund team bus. The B team bus had just left the hotel. The explosions destroyed two windows in the rear part of the bus. People screamed, people jumped to the ground. A fellow Dortmund fan I was supposed to watch match with. He called me and said, turn on the TV there was an attack of the Dortmund bus and I thought he was like, there was impossible. Some of the players screamed at the driver to keep driving as fast as possible because they were worried that people might storm the bus. German investigators say the explosive devices used in the attack on the Borussia Dortmund bus contained metal pins and the one had pierced a seat headrest. Unbeknownst to the team members the actual mastermind behind the attack was as they were disembarking the bus, was actually eating steak and sweet potatoes at the hotel they had just left. Authorities are attempting to verify a letter left at the scene claiming Jihadists were behind the attack. Because there had been a series of attacks by Islamic terrorists in Germany and Europe there was widespread suspicion in the media that this was another Islamic terror attack. Three letters were found at the site of the bombing that took credit for the attack on behalf of Islamic State. There were however reasons to doubt this particular narrative. Would actually be a surprise if ISIS were actually part of this attack. Possibly could be employed by other groups like the Far Right Wing to try and shift the blame. The letters had some strange qualities. They were written in a strange German that used big sophisticated words but had basic grammar mistakes as if someone was native German speaker but pretending to be a foreign person. Federal investigators have detained one man suspected of links to Islamist terrorism, one of two suspects whose apartments were raided this morning. Shortly after the bombing a man in Austria named Rudolf who was a big BBB fan he noticed that something strange was going on on the stock market related to the team's shares. He emailed the lawyers of BBB who then...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1553,2022-11-21 15:20:55
18940," This is something strange what's going on on the stock market related to the team's shares. The emailed the lawyers of BVB who then forwarded that email onto investigators. The email stated that someone had bought 60,000 BVB put options, a wager that the value of the shares of the team would fall below a certain amount at a certain date. Why would someone buy that ahead of a match and then three bombs go off? Something isn't right here. For the person to make money off of that, it required the stock to go down quite a bit in a fairly short period of time. And it wouldn't just be the team losing a match, it would require something much bigger than that. There was another big red flag about this purchase, which is the fact that it had actually been made. Number one on the day of the bombing, but also from an IP address that had been traced to the actual hotel where the bombing had taken place. When three explosions targeted the bus carrying the Borussia Dortmund for ballers on April 11th, written notes left at the scene, claimed the attack was the work of ISIL. The truth, as is now alleged, is remarkable. On April 21st, the police arrested a man in a southern German city called Tsubingen. It was on his way to work, and his name was Sergei Bina-Gord. He seemed like an unlikely suspect because he had no known connections to the Islamic terror world. He didn't seem like a far-right extremist, he didn't seem like a left-wing extremist either. He seemed to be a completely unremarkable young man. A 28-year-old German Russian man named only a Sergei W stayed in the same hotel as the players on the night before the bombing. He specifically requested an upper room overlooking the bushes where the explosive devices were hidden. The media dissected why he would do that, what was his past. He had been inspired by the 2015 terror attack in Paris, and he noticed that in the aftermath of the attack, the stocks of French companies went down, and he believed that if an attack took place that was directed at a specific company, that the decrease in stock price for that company would be even more dramatic. It never occurred to anyone that someone would do that out of greed. We now know that the suspect bought three different derivatives on the Borussia Dortmund shares, with all these derivatives he bet on falling shares. The suspect bought the majority of these financial products on the 11th of April, the day of the attack. If the plot had been complete, successful, and the stock had reached a value of zero, the intergolds would have made up to 570,000 euros, or the equivalent of about $608,000. Ultimately, the plan completely backfired. The attacker, Sergei Wendigot, didn't make any money, in fact, he lost money. In court, he would be extremely quiet. He usually kept his hands clasped together. One of the lawyers actually commented that he had never seen a defendant act so calmly. The intergold had served some time in the German military. From that information and from online research, he was able to figure out how to assemble remote, detonated bombs that would do what he hoped to do. There were a few days of extremely emotional testimony, including the soccer players who described, doubting whether or not they could ever play another game again. It brought everything back up, and it didn't quite help them to kind of process what was going on. Throughout it all, he sat there completely silent. The big mystery that was swirling around the trial was the question of why he may have simply done it because he wanted to impress a woman. Rebecca is a young woman who has a very troubled home life. She ultimately sees her relationship with Vaynergold as an opportunity to leave that troubled home. Vaynergold is a Russian immigrant to Germany. He speaks with an accent.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1554,2022-11-21 15:25:16
18941," With Vaynergold as an opportunity to leave that troubled home, Vaynergold is a Russian immigrant to Germany. He speaks with an accent. He has anxiety in large groups of Germans. She begins to resent the fact that he has these fears and feels a little bit trapped. Rebecca attempts to dump him on multiple occasions and T threatens to commit suicide if she leaves him. Vaynergold apparently told Rebecca that she would soon be seeing a surprise. After being dumped via text message, he apparently began planning for this attack in earnest. Vaynergold was charged with 28 counts of attempted murder, which carried a maximum sentence in Germany of life in prison. He claimed that he had nothing to do with the attack, but as time went on, he admitted that he had actually been the person who had built the explosives and had set them off. But he claimed that he didn't want to actually kill anybody. Ultimately, Vaynergold didn't receive the harshest possible sentence. He was given 14 years in prison, but it's still a considerable amount in jail in Germany. The threats of an asteroid hitting Earth is very real. If it's big enough, it's also very final. These are very, very infrequent events. The probability is not zero, though. A blinding flash of light streaking across the sky. About 100 tons of space rock falls on Earth every day. Most of it is so small it burns up in our atmosphere, or lands unnoticed away from major populations. No human in the past thousand years is known to have been killed by a meteorite. And according to NASA, no large object is likely to strike the Earth any time in the next several hundred years. However, one thing is certain. We haven't found them all. There are thousands out there that we don't know where they are. There are a lot of asteroids in our solar system. They number in billions. Scientists all over the world are working toward detecting and deflecting the most catastrophic of natural disasters. The race is on to find as many of these objects as we can. Yes, the way of calculating whether or not an asteroid is potentially dangerous or not. I think it's something worth investing in. It's our existence that's safe. Amy, let's get this one out of the way. It's probably the question you get asked the most. But how scared should we be? Asteroids and comets are a natural hazard that's out there like a lot of other natural hazards. These are very, very infrequent events. These collision events where an object actually impacts the Earth. The most important thing that we need to know about asteroids is when the next impact is going to happen and how bad it will be. What we know is that an object that's about, say, a kilometer across is capable of causing very, very wide devastation across the planet, really, truly global devastation. The object that wiped out the dinosaurs was somewhere in the neighborhood five to ten kilometers across, so even bigger than that. At a kilometer, it's still going to be very bad and will have global effects. For objects that are capable of causing what I would call sort of regional damage, kind of a large...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1555,2022-11-21 15:29:36
18942," At a kilometer, it's still going to be very bad and will have global effects. For objects that are capable of causing what I would call sort of regional damage, kind of a large major metropolitan area, a city in its surrounding environments, sort of around a hundred-ish meters. It depends on the details of the composition and so forth. By the 1980s, NASA was cataloging near-earth objects. In 1994, Stargazers watched as comet Schumaker-Levy 9 hit Jupiter. The resulting zone of chaos was estimated to be as large as the Earth, and the event became a turning point in the search for asteroids and comets in our solar system. In 1998, Congress tasked NASA with finding 90% of asteroids and comets, one kilometer wide, or larger. Soon after, Hollywood blockbusters Armageddon and Deep Impact brought attention and fear to the masses. The great news is that the vast majority, more than 90% of all the really large, one kilometer near-earth objects have been found. The challenge now is working down to these smaller sizes that are still quite capable of causing a lot of damage, but they're just harder to spot because they're fainter. They're smaller. Can you give us a sense of how many are out there in our solar system? We know that there are a lot of asteroids in our solar system. They number in the billions. Most of them, however, are between Mars and Jupiter and what we call the main asteroid belt. This is a region of space where most of the asteroids in the inner part of our solar system live, and they stay there for many billions of years. There is another population, though, that kind of leaks inward and gets into the region somewhat close to the Earth. And we call these near-earth objects. We think that there are millions and millions of near-earth objects that are out there in the total population. As of today, we know of sort of around 20, 25,000, something like that. When we first spot an object, we really know very little about it. We just see something moving across the sky. So all you get is just sort of a handful of snapshots, just enough to be able to tell that this isn't an asteroid that we've already seen before. And then once we can calculate the distance to it, we can now start to make predictions about its true size. Is it large or is it small? So we have a lot of information that we have to get pretty quickly to really understand what's going on. Finding asteroids is just one piece of the puzzle. Planetary scientists are extremely skilled in determining the orbits and speeds of asteroids based on relatively small amounts of data. NASA runs simulations of the trajectories asteroids could take, which is useful, but time consuming. A team of scientists in the Netherlands have found a way that could buy us more time. Our methods is very quick. So you can very quickly get an assessment of whether or not the objects is danger or not. If you look at the classical way of determining the danger of an asteroid, it may take days of computing time on very big machines to determine this hazardousness. The current problem is that there's just too many asteroids out there to spend a huge amount of computational power on all of them. So the neural network allows us to focus on what really could go and pose a hazard to Earth. A neural network is a computing system that mimics the way the human brain operates to find underlying relationships in a set of data. By training the network in this way, you train it in recognizing those objects that are most likely to hit the planet. And once it's trained, you can apply this network to all the unknown asteroids. And then you can make a selection and saying, hey, this is these are the ones which appear to be having orbits similar to the ones which we know are hitting the planet. That doesn't mean that they do, but it only means that they look very similar to the ones we know they do. What else did you find? Should we be particularly concerned about anything? One thing that we did find is that our neural network was able to go and identify a handful of asteroids which weren't considered potentially hazardous that when we went into the greater than forward in time, they came quite close to Earth. You find a handful which were not detected before or not considered being...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1556,2022-11-21 15:33:59
18943," that when we went into the gradient and forward in time, they came quite close to Earth. You find a handful which were not detected before or not considered being dangerous before, and we think they are potentially dangerous. It's very hard to simulate kind of going forward in time and asteroid that's going to hit Earth because what the Earth is really small. And what space is really big. And then you have to have very exact parameters to shoot an asteroid that goes and hits exactly the Earth. And then Simon had the ingenious idea of not even trying to do that and just launching the asteroids from Earth's surface and integrating backwards in time. It's very hard to make it hit. So you need a lot of calculations which all end up in nothing. And the idea was then like, well, let's not do that. This is basically what NASA is doing. NASA is taking an asteroid, making multiple copies of them, shooting them all forwards in time, calculating their orbits, and then see what fraction sort of gets close to Earth. They'll even hitting Earth but getting close to Earth. And then they call it a potential impactor. So you calculate the solar system forward in time for let's say a thousand years. And then you launch asteroids from the surface as if they, if you go forward in time, would follow on the surface. You calculate them backwards due today. And then you get your orbital parameters of today's asteroid, which you know will land on the planet. And those you can use as known impactors and compare these all the other asteroids in the solar system. Consimulations and AI, can those things fill in the gaps where perhaps telescopes and other imaging tools can't? Absolutely. Since the observations get more complex, the physics gets more complex. And if the physics gets more complex, the mathematics becomes more complex. And at some point you can't solve your problems analytically anymore. And then this is where the computer comes in. Now we have this trained neural network. We have a way of calculating the interferption of the seconds, whether or not an asteroid is potentially dangerous or not. And therefore deserves more attention or more time to spend on, uh, for, for redefining out if it is dangerous. When it comes to hunting asteroids, time is critical. What we can do about a potentially hazardous object depends a great deal on what we know about it. And how much time we have before the encounter. We really like to find them when they're decades away. Because the more time you have, the more options you have. And the less energy it takes to move an object aside. It also means we might not have to resort to launching a nuclear warhead as an asteroid. Until recently, pretty much our only choice. That's an option of last resort in my opinion, yes. We have lots of options available. You can just simply pop into the object and just nudge it out of the way. That's one possibility. And that's kind of in a way the sort of the simplest thing to think about. Just nudge it off its path a little bit with, you know, a massive object, a spacecraft. So it's kind of like bowling, if you will. You know, if you have a long time or a long stretch of runway in the lane, just a very small twist on the bowling ball will make a big change in where it ultimately ends up. Another option would be something where you take a very big, big, massive spacecraft and you park it next to the object and you use the force of gravity as a towing rig that takes longer, though. And you need to be able to send a pretty massive spacecraft and obviously depends a lot on how big the asteroid is. Other options start to get more and more complicated and they range from painting one side of the object of white color and painting the other side dark and letting the pressure of the lights or perturb its orbit. In a departure from the lab and computer simulations, NASA has real plans to rehearse kinetic impact deflection. In 2021, the agency will launch DART, the double asteroid redirection test mission, which will intercept a 160 meter asteroid in 2022. Better to practice now before we have to deal with an actual threat. In the meantime, discovering asteroids is our best bet. Thousands of scientists and amateur astronomers around the world make up an informal network that surveyed the heavens. But that may not be enough.

We need to ramp up our network of sensors, and also we need to just continue to strengthen our network of international observers so that we can get follow-up because we find these objects when they're distributed all over the late sky. Once we get more observations, we get better data, we can make better predictions. If you look at the big impactors we have had in the last, let's say, 20 years or maybe 30 years or 50 years, most of them we haven't seen coming. So the danger, the real danger, I think comes from your objects we don't know about, and not from your objects we do know about. This particular natural disaster, like a lot of natural disasters, and like climate change is a problem with the global commons. So the thing that we risk collectively is that it sort of then becomes nobody's problem and nobody takes our ownership over it. Asteroids are all over the sky. They just truly cross boundaries and borders with a second's notice. And I kind of imagine in the future, maybe he walks a small satellites around the Earth that are always going and looking outward. I mean, I think it's something worth investing in. Sorry, existence that's stake, right? So the pandemic has affected everyone in different ways. Some passed the time by baking. Home made sourdough bread. Do I need to say more? Some chose to binge watch Netflix. It's your game. Or maybe you started a garden oasis in your backyard. Next, I'm going to put my laces in. But for millions of others, I'm going to be posting stocks that will f***ing boom. They wanted to uproot the financial industry. Let's just lock it on up and take 50,000 dollars. Here's a stock that can change your life. I see a stock going up and I buy it and I just watch it until it stops going up. And then I sell it. I haven't gained over $3 million. I want some free money. I don't think you can overstate the online communities of social media influence on financial markets. A large group of inexperienced investors who discuss their plans on social media platform Reddit have shaken up the stock market in a big way. The stock that everybody's talking about right now is GameStop. Video game retailing, GameStop has set to continue their headspinning ascent today. The revolutionaries on Reddit are spanking Wall Street's ass. The more these stocks go up, the more the big guys are getting creamed and losing billions of dollars. This is in a wealthy person's game anymore. Anyone can play it. I took up a little bit of a new hobby and I'm interested in day trading. As an investor nowadays, you don't have to look a specific way. You don't have to wear specific clothes. You don't have to be doing it from a trading floor on Wall Street in like a high-rise building in downtown Manhattan. The narrative of what's driving the markets is no longer being held in secret offices in New York and Boston of privileged people talking to other privileged people. It's right out in the open. It's on Twitter. It's on Reddit. From brokerage apps to discord channels and subreddits to TikTok influencers. One of the last holdouts in the world of disruption, finance is next in line. Investing should be as you pick with us as shopping online. That's Vlad Tenev, the CEO of Robinhood, the online brokerage app. Talking about how he wants his app to disrupt the world of stock trading like Amazon.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1558,2022-11-21 15:42:35
18945," That's Vlad Teniv, the CEO of Robinhood, the online brokerage app, talking about how he wants his app to disrupt the world of stock trading like Amazon disrupted the world of home shopping. And I think that speaks to exactly the mission that a platform like Robinhood has, which is to democratize investing. Robinhood was started in 2013 by Vlad Teniv and by Jubat, in where else Silicon Valley, has an alternative to the big brokerages, but with one big difference. As they were building the social network around finances for people, they realized that there was a gap in the market and that free trading could become something that they could bring to the markets, they could disrupt the industry. While no fee trading is industry standard today, it was unheard of when it was first introduced. The online brokerage industry was really innovative when they came on the scene 10, 15 years ago, but they kind of stopped innovating where you haven't seen those commissions come down beyond five or six or seven dollars. Robinhood, think that by offering zero commission, that they're going to push people onto this platform. And on top of no fee trading, the customers Robinhood was courting have been long overlooked in the world of finance. So the typical customer of a Charles Schwab, for example, is putting a lot more money in that brokerage account than the typical customer at Robinhood. Even today, with all of its popularity, the median account size is about $240. There's fiddalities in the Schwabs and the e-trades of the world. They look down their nose and it does kind of account. I don't want a thousand dollar account. They're just a headache. I want a hundred thousand dollar account. This is key here, right, because the thing about Robinhood that's different than every other single brokerage platform is how easy it is to use. The design of the Robinhood app really has in mind a user who might be coming at this absolutely cold. The fonts are very well-sized, the shapes, the colors. All of that is something that the founders of Robinhood paid really close attention to. And by creating an interface that catered to a newer investor, they were able to gather a pretty healthy group of customers. And by 2019, they had about 10 million customers. Those 10 million customers were a huge success story for Robinhood, but no one could have predicted its explosion after the arrival of COVID-19. It's been endorsed to the greatest extent and 100% of the non-essential workforce must stay home. What we saw when the pandemic hit was the growth of Robinhood users absolutely turbocharged. And oddly, you saw this surge in interest in stock trading. Then they saw the absolute surge in 2020 in customer growth. And now by many accounts, they have more than 20 million customers, which is pretty extraordinary. So the next step for them is to figure out how to monetize those users and how even with their small account sizes to get them to grow with the company and as it releases more products, come along with them. Robinhood would become one of the COVID economies' breakout successes. Robinhood traders, as they're called, became the shorthand explanation for the frenzy of often speculative retail investing after the pandemic lockdowns. Kids, wake up in the morning, they go on Robinhood. They're, you know, in the shower, they check Robinhood. Kids are learning how the stock market works at 8-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1559,2022-11-21 15:46:49
18946," Kids wake up in the morning, they go on Robinhood. They're, you know, in the shower, they check Robinhood. Kids are learning how the stock market works at 18, while they're at school, you know, checking their phones in between classes, because notifications pop up, telling them what their stocks are doing that day. With these new tools, millennials and Gen Z are investing in the market in ways their parents could have never even dreamt of. That is sort of key when we talk about the divide between older and younger generations, is that the younger generation is exposed to so much more information and tools at their disposal to do what they want in the market. The older generations, you never had the technology or the cost structure that you could play the markets like you can today. So you were stuck with giving your money to a professional investor in paying them a fee to do it. When I speak to young kids, they tell me, I'm making mistakes, I'm losing money, I'm not a perfect investor, but I'm 18, and by the time I'm 30, which will be, you know, 10 years from now, I'm gonna have interacted with the markets for a decade. And so it's a learning experience more so than anything else. And you can look at it and you can say, wow, that's, you know, that's risk taking, that's dumb. But, you know, if you could possibly shave 10, 20 years off your working life versus adding five years, I don't think you can fault people for that. But Robinhood is only part of the puzzle. Sure, you can trade on it, but without research, information, and data, you're just blindly throwing darts at different stocks and hoping to strike it rich. Wall Street forever has always run on what we now call narratives or needs. You know, people telling rumors to each other have been around for a hundred years. On Wall Street, information is its own currency. Historically, either you had it or you didn't, and the people who had it had a huge advantage. In the past, those narratives and means didn't have a network effect. It would be one person telling another person over the phone. In fact, when I broke into this business in the 80s, a lot of people used to complain that they weren't on the call list to get those ideas. Social media changed all of that. It passed forward to 2021. That's being done on the internet now. And that's being done on Discord and Twitter and Stocktwits and Reddit. And the impact is very similar, but orders and orders is meant to too large. As social media has played a bigger partner lives, it's also played a bigger and kind of more important role in how people find investing ideas online and on these platforms. How do those ideas spread on TikTok? Yes, that TikTok. Soon, may the women come to bring a sugar and tea and rum. People aren't just going to it for C-shanty videos. The personal finance hashtag on TikTok has garnered 3.5 billion views from its 1 billion monthly active users. By comparison, videos found under the cooking and health tips hashtag have 2.6 and 2.1 billion views respectively. The trajectory of Robinhood and TikTok were literally on par. What happened in the stack market this week? So the word of the week is expectations. Absolutely essential that you just understand the risks of shorting. And Kayla Kilbride and Kyla Scanlon are two of those financial influencer TikTokers, also known as Finn Fluentcers. I think people still care about fashion. They care about culture, but it's also like, there's this big behemoth thing called the stack market that we really don't know a whole lot about. And it's gay kept behind industry. And so people want to unpack that. And so my audience is a lot of them are younger investors who are looking to hone their skills. Tech in right up. Kyla and Kayla are two of the more, let's say, professional TikTok influencers. The Tesla ARP Bitcoin Biotech Risk Cluster. I've been trading since high school, and it was a really interesting way for me to fill out my decision making frameworks and to think about thinking. And I think that the more that we can have people thinking about finance, the better that we're going to progress as a society, I think it's a huge gap in our educational system. If you're going to buy an option for a stock, you can just go up, it's a call. So think of it like this. And here's the options video.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1560,2022-11-21 15:51:22
18947," Community contains multitudes. In one respect, what it did show us among these network groups is they are very sophisticated. They're not a bunch of ignorant people talking to other ignorant people. And this is where the pieces of the puzzle all come together to reach havoc on Wall Street for a solid week in early 2021. It's pretty clear that the combination of more people having retail brokerage accounts and trading apps and more people being stuck at home looking for some kind of entertainment and some kind of community online came together in this very singular way. What came together is GameStop. Let's go back to the beginnings of what happened with GameStop a couple of years ago. On the boards like Reddit and Stocktwist, a lot of people were talking about GameStop as being attractive value. Some of them are even Wall Street alums who left the industry and now still have access to tools that they can use to improve their financial well-being and make very good decisions. And I think Warring Kitty is a perfect example of that. GameStop is one of the most compelling asymmetric opportunities in the market today. Really, I don't understand how you can disagree with that. At the same time that this crowd was talking it up, the hedge fund institutional crowd didn't like the stock at all and it had the largest short interest of any stock in the New York Stock Exchange going into late 2020. Short selling is a bet that a stock price will fall and it's a fairly simple concept. An investor borrows a stock and then sells it. The investor is betting on buying the stock back later for a lower price before returning it to the original owner pocketing the price difference. That a short seller would tell you is that they almost act as a policeman in financial markets or they're at least looking for companies that aren't what they say they are. And that can range anywhere from an outright fraud that some short sellers try to expose to just a company that's not worth as much as investors think it is. The problem is if the stock price rises, the short seller has to come up with the money to buy the stock back. And the more it rises, the more it costs. And that's what's called a short squeeze and the hedge fund Melvin Capital was on the wrong end of that squeeze. Melvin Capital lost over 50% of its money in the month of January alone just from being caught in the short squeeze of the stock. This is where the disruption comes in. One of the most wild stories you're ever going to see, GameStop shares absolutely going nuts. In recent years, the company's stock has jumped from less than $3 a share to almost $350. Cheers everybody! Roaring Kitty has turned $50,000 or so investment into some $14 million. Investors all over social media use the free trading app Robinhood to wreak havoc on Wall Street. They're actually piling on into some of these stocks to really hurt the professional short sellers. And they all used Reddit, Twitter, TikTok and Discord to tell one another to keep buying and quote, hold the line and not sell GameStop. People are getting cheerleaded for jumping in, buying at the highs. They're saying keep going. And it was working too. Until. Thursday morning, the trading app Robinhood sent out this tweet. In light of current market volatility, we are restricting transactions, including GameStop. People were really angry. Robinhood was supposed to allow the regular people to play the same game. These big boys are playing. But instead, we were all taken for schmucks and they screwed us. Shares of GameStop are jumping again now that retail investors are being allowed to buy shares of the stock. But what we learned is that when people organize online, they have the ability to disrupt the market. And it was a big sign that ivory rolls of institution, artist powerful, and maybe the institution slept them to be neat. I don't know if pumping out GameStop was the best use of billions of dollars, but I think that as a signal to society, it was pretty interesting and powerful. The GameStop saga was so impactful that both Vlad Tenev and Roryn Kitty were called into testify before Congress to clarify.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1561,2022-11-21 15:58:29
18948," Interesting and powerful. The GameStop saga was so impactful that both Vlad Henev and Roryn Kitty were called in to testify before Congress to clarify each of their roles in the saga. One thing that's emerged from the congressional hearings is that they're interested in how retail brokerages make money and whether they're keeping the best interests of their customers in mind. But it's pretty fuzzy as far as what they would actually do as a result. While the frenzy around GameStop eventually subsided, it didn't take long for retail investors to find other areas to invest their money. Take a look at Bitcoin going bananas over the weekend. Bitcoin forms a brand new all-time high. It was after GameStop started to drop that we saw Bitcoin really go up to over 60,000. How much further does Israeli have to run? It's compelling to say that money shifted from one venue to the other. While correlation doesn't equal causation, there's a chart out there showing an inverse correlation on meme stocks going down and cryptocurrencies going up. There's definitely an aspect where people are making money on stocks and then moving, you know, they're agnostic, they're not hedge funds. They can invest wherever the hell they want. It's a classic sort of momentum trade. They're going to wherever the winners are and they're willing to jump on and, you know, ride it. So whether it's meme stocks like GameStop, meme coins like Dogecoin are entirely new ways to invest in art like NFTs, the new kind of retail investor is making its presence known. Over the next 10, maybe 15 years, you're going to continue to see whether by choice or by force, that baton go from older generations to younger generations. I don't think any single app is going to be the thing that disrupts. I think people are the disruptors. How people get ideas about what to invest in has become increasingly entwined with social media. And as social media companies govern more and more of our lives, the fact that now they're tied in more intimately to people's wallets is something that we might want to understand better. Usually what disruption I think means is technology comes in, whether it's blogs to the newspapers or online, retailing to brick and mortar. They come in and they're in the same business, but they just do it in such a gigantic cost savings that it causes everybody to switch. Well, that's the risk that happens here is that it's so much cheaper to just manage your own money. We're not there yet, but costs and conveniences are moving in that direction. So I'd say Wall Street, you haven't been disrupted yet, but you could be in the coming years and that the final chapter on this story hasn't been written. Meet Bloomberg's own David Nicholson. Now his happy place is out in the field, on the open road. But like the rest of the world lately, he's been working from home a lot more than he's used to. COVID-19 has prompted a massive urban exodus as professionals of every ilk yearn for more space to live and work. As a result, rural areas have exploded and their poised to experience a resurgence as more and more families pack up and leave the big city to try out life in the verbs. But there's one problem with that. Not all internet speeds are created equal. Anyone who might need to upload or download large files for a living.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1562,2022-11-21 16:02:45
18949," But there's one problem with that. Not all internet speeds are created equal. Anyone who might need to upload or download large files for a living may not want to pack up and move to that cabin in the woods just yet. Now, David's house isn't a cabin, but it is in the woods, and inexplicably, his internet is workable. My internet is okay. I pay a lot for it. It's around $140 a month. The download speed's great, and the upload speed is terrible, which is really bad for my work, because I have to upload these massive files. But I'm definitely one of the more lucky ones in this community. Just a few miles down the road, my buddy, has awful internet. Usually under two down and under point two up. So it's often unusable. Some days it's around one, and other times it'll drop down to about point two, point three. I just want to be able to have internet at my house without having to go outside the normal ways of acquiring internet. It's really frustrating. We're literally miles, a few miles away from downtown, and it just cuts off. This is a problem, and the solutions are not there yet, because getting high speed internet and rural areas on mass is something our providers may simply not be ready for. If your internet service doesn't have fast download and upload speeds, then you don't have high speed harmony. You have. Americans on average pay about $70 a month for internet at home, but in rural areas it could cost a lot more for a lot less service. So the pricing for a fixed wireless provider here can be something between $80 and $150 for about 25 megabits per second. However, Gigabit's service, which is a thousand megabits per second, and Symetrical is running at about a hundred 19 a month through 130 a month. That's John Paul. He co-owns Spiral Fiber, an internet service provider here in Nevada County, California. And for the past 10 years he's been trying to bring an affordable fiber optic network to talent. It all started when he applied to be part of the pilot program for Google's fiber service. Across the country, civic boosters have been going to extreme chanting, singing, and marching, trying to get the search engine giant to look at their town. The internet these days is crucial to be in the world, to be a part of the world, and to be connected to your community. Google ultimately went with Kansas City, Missouri, which left Paul on a mission to get funding to lay out fiber optic networks for Gigabit service. Over the next several years, he would attend conferences and pitch venture capitalists and apply for grants to make his vision come to life. One of the biggest road blocks to building infrastructure for the internet here in the United States are the existing large providers. They have their landstaked out. They would prefer that nobody come in and compete against them. In 2013, we applied for a grant. We went down and met with the commissioners at the California Public Utilities Commission. It was an arduous process to get funded, but we finally did against all odds. We got a $60 million grant and then we went out to seek venture capital. Then in March of 2020, the pandemic hit the world. Everybody got locked down and everybody came home and everybody started using the internet. And I remember seeing on one of the local fixed wireless providers websites, they've said, hey, we know you're all staying home, but please don't use too much video and please don't use too much bandwidth. And I thought that doesn't work. The US connectivity gap is far greater compared to countries that are considered its peers economically. Some developing nations actually have better internet than rural America. Like in Kenya, which has a state-of-the-art fiber optic network fed in from their coastline. The American connectivity gap does largely affect rural areas that are either outside of service coverage or simply prohibitively expensive. This is Rebecca. She and her family moved to Nevada County just a couple miles down the road from David. They took for granted that high-speed internet would just exist in the area. And it's not something they even bothered to check.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1563,2022-11-21 16:07:11
18950," And did that high speed internet would just exist in the area and it's not something that even bothered to check on before buying their house. Turns out all they got was dial up. We wanted to move where we had a little more space, room for the kids to run around, you know, just be out in the mountains a little bit more. Having come from a bigger city area where Wi-Fi is pretty readily available, we hadn't really considered that in our purchasing of the house, whether that would be an option or not. So when school started and now that we are remote learning with our children and we're doing everything from home, we didn't have the option to do that at our house. So every day when school would start, we'd have to pack the kids up and we'd go to my in-law's home. They have a little cabin up in this area that does have Wi-Fi already. Rebecca's situation is the norm in rural America. According to data from the Federal Communications Commission, just 4% of urban Americans lack access to broadband internet. That's compared to almost 40% of people who live in rural areas. While that was the case, there were also racial and socioeconomic divides in terms of who had that access. In addition to that geographic difference, low-income African American students, Latino students, and first generation of college students were more likely than others to have only one device at home that shared among multiple siblings and or lack access to that actual connection. For most American towns, there's also a lack of competition, forcing internet prices up. And large providers like AT&T and Comcast aren't incentivized to expand service to these rural communities. This is how Xfinity makes life simple, easy, awesome. So in our area, we have a small imprint of Comcast, but they're not going to go out to the more rural areas. It's just not cost-effective for them to do it as a large company. In order to lay fiber cable, you're actually physically digging trenches into the ground. And for internet service providers, they're primarily focused on maximizing their profits. And so the fewer customers you have in any square mile and the more fiber you have to lay, that's just kind of harder to pencil out from a purely economic standpoint. AT&T released a statement on the matter, expressing the need and desire for government assistance to fund fiber optic expansion to areas deemed unprofitable. Comcast released a similar statement encouraging more public-private collaboration on this effort. Federal agencies do offer grants to help communities build broadband networks, but many have argued that there's not enough flexibility on how to use these funds. The COVID-19 relief package passed by Congress in March and signed by President Donald Trump awarded $43.3 million to 51 projects on the East Coast alone. But it also stipulated that these projects needed to be up and running by December 30th. For contractors who plan projects months and years in advance, it's a scramble to rearrange their schedules to meet that deadline. So what we've been asking the federal government to consider is at least as long as the projects are getting started, knowing the projects are being put into place to expand both remote learning, working from home and opportunities like that that are truly driven from COVID. We're moving as fast as we can regardless, but hopefully they'll give us some more time. Talking to John Paul, it's clear that he believes broadband is something that can transform a community and should be considered a public good. One of the first communities to come on in the United States with full on gigabit service was Chattanooga, Tennessee. Now they're a bigger city, but they're a city that was economically in a downturn. In the last 15 years, the city of Chattanooga has turned around in an amazing way. It's a nexus for young people to move to. It's a place where technology happens. It's not just about logging on to Zoom, you know, to connect with your colleagues who might be in New York City. It's also your ability as a small business, you know, operating in the town of Nevada City, or wherever it may be, to, you know, quickly upload your payroll documents or something onto the cloud or to quickly, you know, swipe a customer's credit card. There's just some really basic business functions and mechanics that I think people in big cities really take for granted and that are just going to be a much bigger challenge for small business owners and rural areas.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1564,2022-11-21 16:11:33
18951," They take for granted and that are just going to be a much bigger challenge for all business owners and rural areas. one, two, five, six, seven, eight, ten, ten, ten... ten, ten, ten, ten, ten... Historically, the marginalized people, you call them as untouchables or Dalits, they have been kept away from the center of the knowledge. Once you are born into a caste, it is very difficult for you to grow beyond that. You are stuck in that identity. Education is the best way of liberating them. So that's how I chose to work in education sector. The kind of education that we are giving to the marginalized people is going to change not just the fate of these communities in Telangana, but it is going to be the source of inspiration, the source of hope for all the marginalized in this country. The greatest flight in India is the system of caste. For generations of Indians, the social code known as the caste system has defined how people earn a living and whom they marry. Although outlawed seven decades ago, caste remain a significant factor in deciding everything from family ties and cultural traditions to educational and economic opportunities. Dalits, people who are on the lowest rung of the caste system, constitute almost one-fifth of India's population of 1.3 billion. Not able to afford the high tuition of private schools, many are forced to attend government-funded institutions which in the past have suffered from poor infrastructure, lower education standards, and high student-to-teacher ratios. But Dr. Praveen Kumar is trying to change that. I am currently working as head of the Telangana social welfare residential schools. So totally, above 400 schools I manage, these are all residential schools for the students who are historically marginalized but talented and then poor. Up to 60% are girls and then 40% are boys because girls are more marginalized among the marginalized. Their voices are always suppressed. My approach to improve the conditions in the schools has been put your eyes and ears on the ground always. Stock to the parents, stock to the teachers, stock to the students, you know, stay in the schools and then understand their problems, their challenges, both in classrooms and then the corridors and the dorms. Then go to the dining halls and see what kind of food they are eating and then go to their homes and then what kind of food they are getting. And what kind of challenges the parents have. I see what kind of food they are eating. Very good night class. One of the important changes that I brought in after I took over was to complete the transformation of mother tongue to English medium because English medium, as I said, English is the language of emancipation and language that connects you to the whole body.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1565,2022-11-21 16:16:10
18952," For mother tongue to English medium because English medium as I said English is the language of emancipation and language that connects you to the whole body of knowledge in the world. So we had to train a lot of teachers. I am so good at teachers. Hey, how are you? I see you for a time here. I am having a good youth. I am fine with the education. Identity is extremely important. There is a scientific evidence to prove that your sense of identity is extremely crucial to your growth as a successful human being in your life. If you accept an identity which is very humiliating, which reminds you of a very painful past, I think that identity will not help you to grow. I am not saying that you should forget your past. I am not saying that. But that should not be the bubble in which you must live always. Sweros is an alternative identity. S stands for state. W stands for welfare. Aero. S.W. And then Aero is a Swero. So the idea is your dreams have to be skybound. So that is what we are trying to achieve by changing the identities. Like you know, you say I am a Swero. And I aim to be a doctor. I am a Swero. I aim to be a top-notch engineer. I am a Swero. I aim to be a top bureaucrat of this country. I am a Swero. I want to be a very good actor or musician in this world. So these are the positive images that are associated with identity. Just to give an example to you. See in 2012, in our institution we used to produce about six doctors per year. But because of our, you know, this self-eliberating ideology of Sweroism, we have this year we have produced about 189 doctors. This is phenomenal for any poorest of the poor people. You know how difficult it is to get into a medical college in this country. So but today because of this ideology, the students have been able to achieve this. Pujita has been a form labourer and a parent's, the angels are agricultural labourers. And then this girl used to sell vegetables, but thanks to the residential education institutions, she came to the Gowl-Edo D campus and then she toiled very hard for one year, despite many problems. And today I am so happy to share with you that she has joined one of the prestigious medical colleges in the state of Telangana, Usman in Medical College. And then in future she hopes to be a gynecologist. So this is the journey our children are hoping for. Similarly the Mount Everest expertion. Mount Everest expertion, we are very fortunate enough to place the youngest ever female in the history of this world on the peak of Mount Everest. How did this happen? It's all because of an ideology that helps you to liberate yourself. We've got a lot of extra-curricular activities and most of them got institutionalized now. So for example music. Similarly the games. We have so many coaching academy, boxing academy, and Brazilian academy. We have a handball academy. So we have Kabadi, the traditional Indian sport. We have Gould. We have introduced Gould also. Gould is generally played by so-called rich people. But today even poorest of the poor people are also being trained in Gould in our schools. Wow! So our intention has been to give all 360 degrees type of opportunities to the students. So the students are at the top.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1566,2022-11-21 16:20:12
18953," You know, type of opportunities to the students, so that we are interested in whatever activity they can go and then do it. Break the barriers, break the fence at least mentally, because poor people have been programmed to be victims, programmed to be subjugated, programmed to be on the margins, always, programmed to feel inferior, we wanted to change all that. There are certain games which are exclusive to rich people, there are certain languages which are exclusive to middle class and upper middle class in this country, to put it in one word. The sole aim of introducing all these co-curricular activities is to break the stereotypes which are reclusively imposed on these people. Their stereotypes talk to Kumar knows all too well. Born a Dalit, his grandparents were labourers and access to the village well was restricted. Dr Kumar credits his parents' belief in the power of education with helping him realise his aspirations. He went on to join the Indian Police Service, attended Harvard University and then began pursuing educational reforms back home. I attribute whatever I am today to my mother primarily. They educated me in the village, although there were no good schools. So then I stayed in social welfare hostel, the hostels which are managed by government for the poorest of the poor kids. I passed with reasonably good grades, then I went to university and then I faced worst form of discrimination in the universities like. In those days I am talking about the bathrooms and toilets were exclusively meant for sheltered cars and sheltered tribes. I used to fight discrimination on one hand and then again try to excel in academics day in and day out. That's how I came to education because I deeply believe that education is the only important weapon that can really place the poorest of the poor people from a very victimhood orbit to prosperous orbit. I think in future this is going to be a game changer for the marginalized in this country. I think that's going to be a game changer for the poorest of the poor people. I think that's going to be a game changer for the poorest of the poor people. I think that's going to be a game changer for the poorest of the poor people. If you look at a thermal image of a city and then compare that to a map of vegetation, you'll find that where there's greenery the temperature is lower. That's because things like asphalt, concrete and shingled roofs absorb more heat from the sun than trees. This is the urban heat island effect and it accounts for higher temperatures in cities often by several degrees compared with their surroundings. It's becoming a huge risk to human health as growing urban populations exacerbate the heating effects of climate change. Heat waves kill more people than any other extreme weather event, more than tornadoes, hurricanes and even floods. That's why urban heat island mitigation strategies are being studied in Singapore by a group of researchers. The government back project called Cooling Singapore is now in the process of combining everything they've learnt to create a digital tool that can help cities all over the world. Starting.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1567,2022-11-21 16:24:31
18954," The project called Cooling Singapore is now in the process of combining everything they've learned to create a digital tool that can help cities all over the world, starting with Singapore. In Singapore, close to the equator, temperatures regularly rise above 32 degrees Celsius or 90 degrees Fahrenheit. And the city structures only make it worse. And that is also the case for Singapore, which is basically a concrete jungle, more urbanised, more developed city. And even in Singapore, what you have is a situation whereby there's a temperature difference of 7 degrees Celsius between the more urbanised and the more rural areas. The government has taken drastic steps to keep temperatures down. This is Gardens by the Bay, an award-winning park, and inside this greenhouse is a pleasant 24 degrees. That's because the dome, along with two dozen nearby towers full of thousands of people, is chilled by what's probably the world's largest underground district cooling system. It uses a large central plant that cools water and then pipes it into banks, residential towers, an exhibition centre, shopping malls, and the city's iconic Marina Bay Sands Hotel and Casino Complex. So one of the biggest perks of using this system for the buildings is that they can save 40% in terms of electricity usage, compared to your traditional air conditioners. And with Singapore relying on natural gas for most of its power, this new system means emission savings equivalent to removing 10,000 cars from the city's roads. That has big implications for the rest of the world. If things stay as they are, more than a third of the world's electricity could end up being used to call buildings and vehicles by 2050. As the world gets hotter, gets warmer, there is a greater need for air conditioning and as well as refrigerators for instance. And the more people are buying these household appliances, the more energy usage they use and they release heat more and that then exacerbates climate change. It's a vicious circle. And so since 2017, researchers at Cooling Singapore have been identifying design solutions that reduce our need for so much cool air in the first place. One thing many cities have in common and as the importance of vegetation, that's a very important measure to mitigate the urban heat because of the shading effect of course and the psychological effects of the vegetation and also because of the possible evaporative cooling effect of the vegetation. Vegetation can be of course on the ground floor in form of trees and shrubs and you can walk under them. This is the so called canopy layer that the vegetation forms above us but vegetation can also go up the facades of buildings and it can go to the roof of the buildings. Luckily, Singapore has been striving for the garden city feel for quite some time. It was a vision initially introduced by them Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew in 1967 to make life more pleasant for people and today Singapore is one of the world's greenest cities in terms of urban vegetation. Camping Admiralty, a community centre that contains health facilities and social spaces now provides more green space than the plot of land it was originally built on. It's topped by a roof scape of staggered terraces covered in local plants which functions as a community park and a village green in the centre that contains farm plots for residents to tend to. Park Royal on Pickering was designed as a hotel in a garden that doubled the green growing potential of its site. There's now 15,000 metres of sky gardens, reflecting pools, waterfalls, plantar terraces and green walls and the government has big plans as well. Singapore actually has a plan to plan 1 million trees and add more green spaces over the next 10 years. It is actually...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1568,2022-11-21 16:28:57
18955," Singapore actually has a plan to plan one million trees and add more green spaces over the next 10 years. It is actually a mix of one thing to reduce the urban hit island effect, but on the other hand is also to get the people to be more connected to nature. But it's not enough. The city state has still been warming twice as quickly as the wild average over the past six decades. That's why Coolyn Singapore has developed a catalogue of other potential heat mitigation measures. When you try to mitigate your mid-earned effect in a city or in any building, in a village as well, the first place to start is by shading off the windows. You have to keep areas clear so that the wind can move through it. Water of a certain depth can act as a very good thermal buffer. If you have to construct heavy buildings such as high rises, at least you can make the surface the facade less heavy and you can protect it from direct sun penetration. You have to make sure that no combustion engines will be in the city in the middle and the medium to long-term range. So ideally the electricity production is outside of the city and you bring just the clean electricity into the city. You can at least minimize the use of energy in the city and you can start to slowly convert the roofs, the facades of the city into production areas for renewable energy. In Singapore unfortunately this is a limited option but in the long run it could produce up to 20-25% of the energy of the electricity needed in Singapore if all the roofs and the areas in the buildings on the buildings on the facades would be used to do that. With so many different ideas, calling Singapore is also designing a virtual model of the city to test them out. It is called a digital urban climate twin or duct. It will calculate how each element of the city's design will impact the urban heat island effect. That means we model not only the geometry of the buildings digitally but also we model the transportation, the insulation, the temperature, the radiation coming from the sun, the weather, the local weather, the local climate, the even very, very micro climate of the city. The water, the movement of people in the city, we can invent scenarios, we can design scenarios, test them before we actually build them and if they test very well and we are sure that they will function, then we can start to build them and put them into reality. Singapore will be using this new tool to figure out which actions it should take next and the model can be applied to any city, whether it needs to keep heat out or keep heat in, which will ultimately save energy, slow climate change and improve our quality of life. So this is something that Singapore will be able to export, maybe even together with its city development system that it already has. Singapore is one of the very few cities in the world that really combine this scientific approach with a very well established urban redesign and design approach through its agencies and the combination of its agencies, it has achieved a lot in the past. If it keeps following the scientific path and the combination with the other knowledge in the city already, we think that it will be a very comfortable and very livable city in the future even more than today.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1569,2022-11-21 16:33:08
18956,"ñ Time's a tough. Jobs are scarce. It's risky to be outside and around others. Seems like there's very few ways to make extra money during a pandemic. So I guess I'll just hunker down and binge social media until this all blows over. Wait, don't these people make money? How do these people make money? Streamers, YouTubers, Twitch stars, how do they make money? Is it a lot? Is it a lot of work? I know. I gotta ask somebody in the biz and I got just the guy, Austin John plays. This is your full-time job now, right? As of November of last year, yes. This was always just kind of like a side thing. Like any money that I made from doing my videos and whatever else, I never touched that, because I didn't really think of that as being like real money. And then it started coming in more and more. And then it was like I hit my first day that I broke a grand and I was like, this is actually gonna be money. How did the YouTube channel come to be? When the game Pokemon Sun and Moon came out for the 3DS, there was like things that I learned about the game and then I wanted to just share that information with people. And at the time, I didn't have any way to capture screen or anything. So I found like generic footage and I kind of put it all together with so much editing and that video got six views. And then two days later, I made another one and that one got 12 views. And then I just started pumping out more and more content and people were like, this guy knows what he's talking about. It really just started building on top of itself and then it was like, my channel really focuses on tips and tricks. So I play a straight 18 hours and I'll finish the game or get to about the 40 hour mark. And then I'll make my first video. While I'm going through, I have a giant no pad and just scribbles everywhere and I make these notes of like the things that stumped me. So I know the things that may stump other people. What do you need to think about if you're building your YouTube channel? One, you need to do something that you're passionate about. Not that you like, not that you think you're gonna make money on something you're passionate about. This other thing is something that other people are passionate about. It holds a special place to them. And third is, it needs to be something that people are gonna seek out information on. In order to enter into the marketplace, you either need to be better than everyone else, you either need to be faster than everyone else, or you need to be more accessible than everyone else. And you can't be more accessible because it's already on the platform granted if you understand how the algorithm works, which is very similar to Google Analytics, then yeah, you can have a little bit of a head start. But if you're not doing it faster, and if you're not doing it better than everyone else, then why should in one watch your channel? So my income as a YouTuber kind of breaks down to three different ways. One, which is the bulk of it, which is ad revenue. Whenever you go and you watch a video and then there's an ad and then you wait five seconds and hit the bottom right corner and then you go on to the next video or a non-skippable ad or the video starts immediately, you get the little banner ads at the bottom or if you scroll down from the video, the first thing that shows there is an ad. Those are the four different types of ads that can appear on every single YouTube video. And all of them pay a certain amount. It varies on lots of things, like the country of the person who posted the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1570,2022-11-21 16:37:38
18957, YouTube video and all of them pay a certain amount. It varies on lots of things like the country of the person who posted the country of the person who watches it the time of year where you are in the quarter if there's anything going on with a reduction in ad revenue like great example COVID-19 companies weren't as spending as much on advertising so because of that CPM went down CPM stands for a click per thousand and using the Roman numeral for a thousand and that means that for every one thousand views you get a certain amount of money now on low ads when I first started off my CPM was 30 cents so every thousand views I made 30 cents but then once I signed with an MCN and I started making more quality content and more engaging content some of my better videos and certain times of the year I can see CPMs as high as 12 to 14 dollars and there's a big fluctuation between you know if I post a video when there's no ads being spent like January and February that's a reason a lot of your favorite YouTubers and also TV shows don't post new videos in that time of year because ad rates are down why are they going to make content then instead you're recording and you're bulking up for when ad revenue is higher the second way that a YouTuber makes income is support crowdfunding things like that when I first started off patreon was really the only option but then they started rolling out supporters and members for YouTube channels so whenever I have a live stream you can click a button and then you could become a member and then you get a special icons next to your name I believe they're called badges or on any video you can hit the join button and that helps support the channel and then the third aspect of that would be merch and for me my merch has been somewhat basic in fact I'm wearing one of my t-shirts from last year right now you have to endure the times that your first video gets six views that you posted on Reddit and they say shut up and then an auto mod bans you you have to go through that because until you go through that and you discover why you're doing it you're not doing it for other people you're doing it for yourself if you're not loving what you do then it's not worth it huh so make a channel about something that I'm passionate about oh sweet I guess I can make the channel about that now how do I grow an audience how do I get popular it's all about diversification right you have to have a massive twitter following you have to have a massive instagram following you have to have a massive youtube following of course you have to be on twitch which is the key platform but basically anyway you can get in front of your audience you can engage with your audience and it is going to drive those clicks which ultimately drives the advertiser revenue that you get back from all of these platforms it's me and then playing video games and talking in a funny manner over them they're not just people who are good at games they're actually people who are good at online engagement online entertainment first and foremost you have to write to remain stylish anything you wear can and will be used to gc in the quarter fashion the streamer is either very very talented at the game the best player in the game is generally going to draw crowd because people like watching people who are very good on the other hand they're either very very good or funny charismatic whatever it is on that side you know it becomes more of a show where they talk about other things outside of the gaming world and gaming becomes really just a backdrop and an excuse to engage with our audience there were those weird like Ronald McDonald like straight to VHS movies remember those I'm personable I'm chatty I would kind of you know when boring things were happening the game I would ramble on about you know movies I'd watched or books I'd read and you know or conversations and that's love you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1571,2022-11-21 16:41:56
18958," I'm personable, I'm chatty, I would kind of, you know, when boring things were happening in the game, I would ramble on about, you know, movies I'd watched or books I'd read and, you know, or conversations I'd had and stuff like that. And so I think being personable was a big part of that. It's not just getting on and playing games, it's getting on and being an entertainer. You are putting on a show. All right, now let me go ahead and grab the samurai sword that every gym has. Okay, he's dead. I have a larger audience and to have that audience, I think, stay with you. You have to bring something extra, you know, you have to find your niche. You have to find what works and what connects with the audience and what makes them laugh and what makes them keep coming back. Then you got to make it a little more exciting. All right, throw in a hanging bishop. Have everybody in suspense for a moment. I think the real most important thing is, is to just get used to being on camera. Like in any sort of performance thing, is get used to talking on camera. You know, my first few videos were terrible. But because I sat down and did it for six to eight hours a day, I just got used to talking and I got over that uncomfortable hump. If you go into Twitch purely with the expectation that you're going to make money, make a job out of it, have all this growth and it's going to be great, you're probably going to burn out prior to getting to that point. Because there's very little payoff for a long time, right? Like multiple years generally before you really start to see a payoff. And so, you know, those first few times you're streaming, nobody is there. One person shows up every 30 minutes says hi, maybe, and leaves, right? Like, it's very discouraging, I think, for a lot of people. And so you have to be there just loving it. You have to love talking to yourself when nobody is around. You have to love just the game that you're playing, all of that stuff because it takes a while and I think a majority of people burn out prior to getting to the like profitable point of it. And there you have it. My very own YouTube, Twitch, Discord and streaming channels all ready to go live. It's a very valuable social media ecosystem just on the verge of thriving. So don't forget to smash like and subscribe and visit my Patreon for perks. Also, go to my merch page. And one last thing, stay cool, my friends. Thank you very much. This is live stream shopping, one of the hottest trends in China. Every night, tens of millions of people watch live shows hosted by influencers like Thea and by the products they recommend. On e-commerce and social apps like Taobao and Do-In, the sister app of TikTok. I think it's already changed. It's a very expensive way. You can also see it. Of course, you can see it. It's not about only shopping. It's about the experience. It's about having fun. You got to see 3D, you got to see some kind of action. It's almost like a theatre act. The internet craze has taken over China. By the end of 2020, the country had almost 400 million live stream shopping users. China's live stream e-commerce market has also grown dramatically with an estimated value.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1572,2022-11-21 16:46:20
18959," E-cover's market has also grown dramatically, with an estimated value of $161 billion in 2020. It's becoming popular outside China as well. So it's live streaming the future of shopping. Live streaming is not a new thing, and China is started in 2015 with the rollout of 4G, and it was first used for entertainment and socializing. Many live streamers perform for their followers or chat it to them, making money by receiving virtual currency and gifts. In the west, live streaming is mainly the domain of avid gamers, and China is broken into e-commerce. China actually has a very big e-commerce empire, so it uses these super apps, what we call that you have payment, you have search of information, you have recommendation system, and you have huge amount of goods available on the platform, and as well as a lot of consumers. So with this advantage, they merge these features of live streaming to make the influencers actually sell goods. Here is a perfect choice, nice neutrals, beautiful prints, nothing overwhelming, and the warmth and comfort of flannel. This is I don't know. Traditional TV shop involves a one-way direction whereby a host introduces a product, demonstrates things, and say, call this number or something, but live stream shopping is live. That in itself is a very big difference. It causes different psychology, and live stream shopping is a very entertaining way of engaging someone else. When you shop, actually this live streaming video will continue, it will minimize into a corner, and you can buy the items and pay all on the same app. After that, the live streaming screen will just enlarge by itself, and the promoter will come back to screen. So it's very convenient. Kaobao, one of China's biggest e-commerce platforms owned by tech giant Alibaba, added a live streaming function in early 2016. In the following years, other e-commerce and social platforms like JD and Do-In also integrated this feature. About $70 billion worth of goods was sold by a live stream on Tao-Bao in years from March 2021. Latest surveys show that over 60% of live stream users in China were watching shopping shows, and over 65% of them shopped at least once via live stream. In 2020, live stream shopping got a huge boost during the pandemic. With millions of people were in lockdown and many retailers were pushed online. People during the lockdown felt like there's a need for more social interactions. This live platform creates an interesting kind of environment that these people, the sense that I'm actually interacting with you. And then live stream shopping brings in a lot more variety of things that people could buy and satisfy in order to sense the sense of a losing control especially during the pandemic. At the heart of this craze are the top influencers who have tens of millions of followers and sub-products worth millions of dollars every night. They often use their star power to get bargains from retailers which in turn boosts their own sales and influence. So if you think about China's live streaming you have to know the king and queen of the influences. The queen of live streaming via she is actually having the biggest viewership and the biggest sales volume for a long time on top of the platform. She can sell everything from like Gucci sunglasses, lipstick, homes and cars. One time she offered her followers to go on a Tesla ride with her and she even for once so they rocky launch in her live streaming room for 40 million yuan.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1573,2022-11-21 16:50:45
18960," right with her and she even for once so they rock you launch in her live streaming room for 40 million yuan. The king be Li Jiaqi, he was widely known as lipstick spreader. He used to be a cosmetic sales before he turned into live streaming e-commerce and he knows a lot about the cosmetics. So he's the one that will actually put the lipsticks on himself when he's on the show. Top live streamers like VIA and Li Jiaqi have become celebrities in China and earn millions of dollars a year. Although not everyone can be as popular, mid-breaking live streamers like Tiffany, Stuart and a good income through sales commissions. linear We don't simply make an introduction by saying what we work for. You to make one institution every day do it. Like things about people have done this today, I think that homemade it without any toys is consideredethical. All the society members really need a smooth mind. However, for high-rank list, If you don't have a job, you can buy it. A lot of successful live streamers are generally very good at communication. They are very good at articulating very simply what the product does and doesn't do. In order for them to sell, they need to be trustworthy and appear trustworthy. And they need to show in some ways that they are authentic. So, for Via and Li Chasi, they are able to articulate that quite a bit through their body language, through what they say, for example, Li Chasi will always say bad things about certain products because to him there is this honest opinion and some people want to hear that. And so, they seem very credible, they seem very trustworthy. And don't forget, they are also very entertaining and very interesting. If you are familiar with Li Chasi, you want a generous record for the most live streamer applications to models in 30 seconds. So, if you are able to create a lot of bars, you can just think things that you do. People who may not want to buy lipsticks but also streaming just to watch what he does. And then from there, you might get hope to just shouldn't be banned using toolmender software to the company. Live streamers also use sales techniques such as limited time or supply. These sense of scarcity can often encourage viewers to buy. The platform in itself creates and enhances some of these things, but you see it live. Something we call social proof as second over, meaning that, hey, other people are interested, other people are joining in. Other people want the same product. And they add in a chat and ask questions and say, oh, I want this too. What happens then? It makes the whole product even more scarce. But it's not just influencers, local farmers, luxury brands, even mutual funds have also started their own live stream shows. Working with very top tier live streamers can be risky. It's not necessary that the benefits will end up with a brand. So we see company executives opening their own shows. And we see like PNG have their own sales room which runs shows every day as well. We also have local governments in small towns to sell their agricultural products. So the live streaming is definitely transformed the way product owners can think about how to reach their consumers. And it enables a lot of players to actually sell. And live stream shopping is going global. Merchants in Southeast Asia have embraced this trend. And in the West, Amazon has upgraded its live streaming function, adding interactive features like chat rooms. Companies, including Google and Facebook, are also developing and investing in technologies to integrate video and e-commerce. On the ten-only year's morning stream, they're developing two homemade ones at ones level.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1574,2022-11-21 16:55:17

18962," But that hasn't stopped others from trying. Companies are focused on testing projects out at sea, proving their durability, trying to raise capital and bring down cost. The sector hasn't really converged around one single technology design, and companies are kind of undersided about which design works best. Finland-based AW Energy is a veteran in the sector. The first proof of concept of the company's device was made in the 90s after diver Rano Koei-Vasari observed the strong back and forth movement of a hatch cover in a shipwreck in the Baltic Sea. The waves are generated far from the coastline, so the wind blows on the surface of the water, causing the water particles to rotate, and that rotation extends deep down below the surface, and the waves can be very long, they can be several hundred meters long. And as they come into the near shore, this rotational energy turns into an elliptical energy, and eventually back with the force that you probably noticed if you've been swimming on the sea shore in large waves, you're pulled in and out. That's the energy that we're extracting. But there's a sweet spot where we deploy, so around 10 to 15 meters of water depth, that's where there's still strong wave energy coming in. After years of research, prototyping and testing, the company has deployed Wave Roller, a 350 kilowatt device in the waters of Portugal. Wave Roller has an 80 meter wide and 10 meter high steel panel fixed to the seabed via a flotable foundation. The panel moves back and forth with the waves, capturing the energy. It's submerged in the depth of 15 meters, so it's protected from the extreme waves. We generate electricity by capturing the movement with hydraulic circuitry in a machine room underneath the surface, that hydraulic energy we turn to electricity with hydraulic accumulators and hydraulic motors, and also our generator. The Wave Roller has survived large waves at sea for over a year, and delivered electricity via an underwater cable to the grid in Portugal. Meanwhile, the company has won a 2.5 million euro grant to work on an upgraded version of the Wave Roller, aiming to increase the electricity generation capacity to 1 megawatt. The upscale device would have a bigger panel, two power takeoff units, and improved software to control the energy production. We have taken into use a very prediction algorithm that tells us what kind of waves are coming into our device. That gives us a few seconds to prepare for capturing more energy and the difference in that is significant. Our future plans are to deliver technology around the world. So I'm hoping we can be working on delivering technology to projects in Asia and also in American contents as well. Meanwhile, Israeli company EcoWavePower is taking a different approach to capturing the power of the ocean. For the company's founder, IneBravamin, developing new sources of renewable energy is a personal mission. I was born in Ukraine in 1996, and two weeks after I was born, the Chernobyl nuclear reactor exploded, causing the largest in history, nuclear disaster. I was one of the babies that got hurt from the negative effects of such explosion. I had a respiratory arrest and a clinical death. Luckily, my mother and nurse approached my crib on time and gave me a mouth-to-mouth resuscitation with saved my life. I got a second chance in life and decided to do something good with it. Growing up, Ine wanted to be a politician to positively change the world.

18963," Anna wanted to be a politician to positively change the world. After working as a translator at a renewable energy company, she decided to change parts. Solar and wind energy were fully commercialized. There were a lot of amazing technologies implemented everywhere. I saw that wave energy, although it's an immense source of electricity, the biggest companies in the world are trying to develop wave energy with no success. And there was kind of a race going on in the world of who is the company that is going to develop a viable wave energy solution first. In 2011, the then 24-year-old inner co-founded EcoWave Power. Instead of installing devices offshore, the company's devices are attached to existing breakwaters, jetties and peers. Our technology is very cost-efficient, especially in comparison to the offshore technologies, because we don't need any ships, divers, underwater mooring or cables when installing existing man-made structures. And all our expensive equipment, the generator, the hydraulic conversion unit, the automation, is located online just like a regular power station. This is the EcoWave Power conversion unit that has been operating in Jaffa port since 2014 until 2020. Here you can see how the technology works. Basically, the flotters are going up and down and pushing the hydro cylinders which transmit by the gradeable fluid into land-located accumulators. A pressure is being built, the higher the waves, the higher the pressure, which is used to turn the hydro motor, which is turning the generators. The whole system is controlled by a smart automation system, which you can see right here. And in case of a coming storm, the system automatically raises the floater above the water level and keeps them in the upward position until the storm passes. The company has been operating a 100 kilowatt grid-connected device in Gibraltar since 2016, which is enough to power 100 households. Currently, Inu and her team are working on another 100 kilowatt project at the Ported Jaffa in Tel Aviv. The project will be also the first time in the history of Israel that wave energy will officially connect to the electrical grid. And our goal going forward is to expand it to all suitable breakwaters in the city of Tel Aviv and to supply a significant part of the city's electricity needs. Today, engineers and entrepreneurs are still trying to crack wave energy. Globally, only a few hundred kilowatts of wave energy are deployed compared with gigawatts of offshore wind. But the filters come a long way in recent years and with the right engineering solutions, this new power source could eventually become competitive with more mature renewables like solar and wind. I would have a lot more confidence in the success of wave energy companies today as opposed to like 20 years ago. But in the next few years or maybe the next couple of decades it will be more likely to be used in remote locations like islands that are otherwise dependent on expensive diesel power or out at sea on gas decommissioning rigs or full powering underwater autonomous vehicles. So definitely wave energy can compete with other renewable energy sources but I personally believe that this is not a competition. In order to have a 100% renewable energy friendly world we need all renewable energy sources to work together.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1577,2022-11-21 17:08:01
18964," here right... So can you please tell me? I'm not going to throw my phone. Please wait. You know I've covered a lot of companies, I've covered a lot of Machiavellian companies where you know people play rough. I don't think I've ever seen anything on the scale or Nissan. One of the most dramatic elements was Rivendor Passe's home being raided by court officials in Yokohana. So Rob Passe's journey into the darkest recesses of the Japanese corporate world started when he was the general council, the highest corporate lawyer position in the company. In the past few minutes Nissan has revealed that its chairman has been arrested after allegations of serious misconduct. He was tasked with investigating Carlos Gown. And he was told conduct an internal investigation and get to the heart of the matter. And then along the way he started to notice serious conflicts of interest. He is one of the few people who knows an extreme amount of detail regarding the alleged crimes by Carlos Gown. And he is now ready to tell his own story on the record about some of the events that happened. My name is Rivendor Passe. I'm the former global general council of Nissan Motorco Limited. And you could say yes I had a front row seat in terms of what was going on. When Carlos Gown saved Nissan years ago he was depicted in Japanese comic books as this hero and now maybe we'll see comic books where he's the villain. In corporate Japan Nissan was quite an unusual company. It was led for two decades by a non-Japanese executive. Well Carlos Gown was a hero in the Japanese business world. If you had a global business celebrity in Japan and worldwide it was definitely Carlos Gown. In a country with few foreigners at the top he stood out. But over the years he saved Nissan from bankruptcy, allied with Rino and Mitsubishi and turned the alliance into one of the most competitive in the world. Yet as the years went on I think his ambitions changed a little bit. He started thinking about legacy plays and one of them was to really tighten the alliance between Rino and Japan. And unbeknownst to him there was a contingent of senior Nissan executives that were really felt threatened.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1578,2022-11-21 17:12:24
18965," And unbeknownst to him, there was a contingent of senior Nissan executives that were really felt threatened by that move. They really thought that they would lose complete control of the car company. And even in the government there was probably a little bit of anxiety about a national champion in the auto industry falling under full blown foreign control. Carlos Gone was an auto industry leader respected by many in Japan. Now he's in jail. The arrest of Carlos Gone came completely out of the blue. This was in November of 2018. He was coming to Japan on Nissan's corporate jet for a regular executive meeting. And he was met on the tarmac by Japanese authorities who whisked him away to jail and charged him with financial misconduct crimes. So what happened was a power struggle ensued inside the company and somewhere along the way it was criminalized. By that I mean that there were allegations leveled at Carlos Gone about the way he reported his pay to Japanese authorities, the way he handled money inside the company, that in other contexts might have been a board action, might have been handled internally. A number of executives at Nissan decided to take this difference and take it over to the Tokyo Prosecutor's office and that unleashed a chain of events that would shake the entire auto industry. So after Carlos Gone was arrested, Nissan launched an internal investigation into the events that led up to his arrest. So Rob Pasi was tasked with investigating Carlos Gone and he was told get to the heart of the matter. Find out what Carlos Gone did wrong and bring it to our shareholders. Yeah it's really complicated because you had various things coming out of the weeds. In 2018 the investigation has started and we become aware of matters in terms of conflicts, actions by certain individuals that cause some concern because things might not quite be what they seem. So in our story we really took a close look at Harinada and his role in Carlos Gone's downfall. Harinada is one of the most fascinating figures inside Nissan. He's also a lawyer, he's originally Malaysian. And he had a meteoric rise through the company and became very very close to Carlos Gone and other top figures. He had a front row seat at all the major strategic deliberations at the company. And when he discovered that Carlos Gone as his final legacy play was going to tighten the relationship between Renaud and Nissan, he made a decision to go against Carlos Gone. And he became one of the key figures that decided that Carlos Gone had to go. Harinada was somebody who actually recruited me into the company. So I have a longstanding relationship with him or did have a longstanding relationship with him. For many many years he was a mentor. I had doubts about the credibility of the process right at the start. Harinada had a plea deal with the Tokyo prosecutors. Now that suggests he was intrinsically involved in some of the wrongdoing or the allegations of wrongdoing. And it just didn't smell right, just doesn't sit right. So there was a basic conflict of interest. In other words, Harinada had to deliver results to Japanese prosecutors to avoid his own criminal.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1579,2022-11-21 17:16:35
18966," In other words, Harry Nada had to deliver results to Japanese prosecutors to avoid his own criminal liability and he's accusing and leading the investigation of Carlos Gown. Some of the people who had been involved in the original alleged crimes were also looking into the affairs themselves. Revinder Pasi began pointing out some of these conflict of interest issues. And the reason for that is essentially his concern was for the company. If the company's own investigation into itself was compromised, that could lead to a very weak position in various lawsuits that it was dealing with across the world. I had discussions with Harry, discussions about the statutory auditors, about these conflicts, discussions with HR, about some of these conflicts. Because at that point, we reported into him. You know, at the time everything was quite, as you can imagine, it was, we've got to do this, we've got to do that, we've got to move fast. But when you step back and look at some of these things, you just think, my god, what was going on here? Because me, members of my team, were being placed in immediate danger. Your chairman's been arrested. A representative director's been arrested. They both happened to be foreigners. And then now what we need to do, we're being instructed to do, is certain compliance professionals need to go into properties in Brazil, for example, and retrieve evidence. They've got to do it very carefully, because if they don't do it carefully, they're going to get convicted of criminal activities. And likewise, when a team of lawyers were commissioned to go to Lebanon, one of my immediate concerns was, why are lawyers from Nissan being sent to go to Lebanon to retrieve evidence? These are just lawyers, they're called lawyers from Nissan. You had revelations that a number of executives had benefited from share appreciation rights when they shouldn't have. I mean, you know, substantive amounts of money being taken by these guys when they weren't entitled to take them. And you do think, yes, how is this going to look later on? It's going to look quite concerning. So that triggered, for me, the sort of assessment that, well, I'm going to have to do something. Because up until this point, I haven't put down on paper these conflicts and these issues. So Rob Posse makes a fateful move. He writes this letter to the board, listing every suspicion he has, in great detail backed up by evidence backed up by memos of why this internal investigation had serious problems. He sends the letter to the board and it's crickets. He doesn't hear much of anything. Nothing happened then, often. Nothing at all. Just like it just gone into a black box. And he began to suspect that there was a desire, even at the highest level within Nissan, to kind of sweep these conflicts of interest under the rug. Unfortunately for me, I think, again, with hindsight, people must have thought that this is the nail that's sticking out and we can't have this. Within three days.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1580,2022-11-21 17:20:55
18967," People must have thought that this is the nail that's sticking out and we can't have this. Within three days of me submitting that to the Board of Directors, that letter to the Independent Board of Directors, I was removed from the Goan Executive Conduct matters. I was then told that I could not attend board meetings anymore. And up until that point, I had attended every single board meeting. I was then also told that after eight years of being in Japan, I'd be going back to the UK. It eventually transpired that I'd be the VP of Projects and Transformation, managing a team of three. So you can imagine what this feels like at this stage. Almost an arbitrary removal from Japan, where I've lived for eight years, had three children there. My family has grown up and we've been saddled there. Having a few months earlier been promoted to Vice President at a global level, to being almost demoted. So Pasi was essentially being reassigned to get him as far away from the internal investigation, as possible, and also to a certain extent, in retaliation to some of the issues that he brought up regarding the internal investigation and harinata. What happened to Pasi can be seen as a series of corporate humiliations. I mean, first of all, his immediate responsibilities were taken away from him. Eventually he'd lost the coveted General Counsel title. But it didn't stop there, toward the end of his stay in Japan, Rav and his wife were convinced that they were being followed. During that period, I'd noticed that once driving my car, I'd have other cars following me. First on my notice, this was it around Mid-March. And I was driving, I can't remember where I was going, but this grave van, small van just literally started following me. And I noticed that there was somebody in the car taking pictures. And lo and behold, we were absolutely being followed, by either by people on foot or other individuals. Two or three normally two burly men in a car, different cars at different times, following us around. They were following the family as well. And given we'd seen, right seen, the Nissan Security Department, behave in a very, very egregious manner with others in terms of following and surveilling, I was very concerned as to what they were doing and who they were giving this information to. Because if they're giving this information to the authorities, you do think, why? What's going on here? I mean, this is just not normal behavior. And this all culminated in a rather dramatic event in the middle of 2020. Who are you people where Nissan had hired a legal team and had obtained an unusual court order from the District Court in Yokohama? To basically do a search end of his home and seizure of his corporate laptop and phone and other documents. If you don't let us in now, we have to break this key. So it's a pretty extreme way to treat someone who had spent 16 years at the company. These people have all come in. We don't really know who they are, apart from the fact that I've been shown a badge that says the Yokohama Court. And they hit to recover a laptop and a mobile phone. It was even more weird because I'd highlighted to the directors that certain Nissan executives were trying to recover this laptop and this phone, was still in Japan.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1581,2022-11-21 17:25:16
18968," that there, that certain misunderstandings were trying to recover this laptop and this phone, whilst I was still in Japan. And I was very concerned because it had evidence on there that related to misconduct matters and other forms of inappropriate conduct. It was just another form of intimidation, another form of harassment, forcing me almost to leave the company and the country. Because once they'd retained and obtained these items, we were still followed, which again I just couldn't understand, or what is the point of doing that? You know, this isn't a car company, this is not the KGB. I think it's fair to say that Rob Posse didn't have full battlefield awareness of all the intrigue going on at Nissan. I mean, Harry Nata is interesting because he's both charismatic and charming and one of the most brutal corporate infighters one could ever run across. It's a confidential company email, right? You should not have this. If he had fallen into line, he would probably still have his job at Nissan, be paid very well, and continue to his work. A career that he spent, you know, 16 years building at Nissan is irretrievably broken. It's been smashed to smithereens. He and his family paid a huge price certainly, but in terms of being able to sleep at night, I think, you know, he's come out ahead. I highlighted issues to the highest levels of the company, so that they could be dealt with appropriately by those in charge. There was no response to those, and there was retaliation against me. What's really profound, like absolutely profound, is that none of your colleagues, I mean, people who you have known for years, forget it. You're on your own. And, yeah, you gotta be ready. You gotta be ready for that. If you take it on anyway. This is the awful truth. There's always someone in the family that's pushing it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1582,2022-11-21 17:29:43
18969," There's always someone in the family that's pushing it. This lady does not deserve to be taken advantage of. Expressionally at your age with your own grandchild. Yeah. My grandma is having to sue them. I'm testifying against them. Nobody's talking. They're one floor below right now. I get afraid to go on the elevator. It's sad that it had to devolve to this. It's like a soap opera to me. It's a very sad thing. It's a family feud. A family feud. Here's a family that, on paper, you would think, has the wealth that so many people seek yet. At the end of the day, it seemed to rip everybody apart. My name's Tom Schoenberg. I'm a senior reporter here at Bloomberg News. Cover financial enforcement. I was approached by someone close to the Shottenstein family and asked whether or not I would be interested in writing about Beverly Shottenstein and this case that she had against JP Morgan. It was immediately clear that there was a great story here to be told. I started just assembling all sorts of documents that the family made available to me. It included a diary that Beverly had begun writing when she started having suspicions about what was actually going on with her money. Beverly obtained her wealth from the Shottenstein retail empire that has, at times, included big lots, value city, American Eagle Outfitters, DSW shoes. Beverly's husband died and at which point they sold off their portion of the company, bringing them an enormous amount of wealth in around 1990. Estimates of her wealth were around $90 million. She, for many years, had that pool of money being managed by outside advisors. Her grandsons in the late 2000s had both graduated and were becoming financial advisors. She gave them a little bit to work with and over time, her grandson Evan became the trusty of her entire state. Managing sort of family money is not a conflict. In fact, some ways in wealth management, it's kind of how you get your start. It's kind of the seed that you need to sort of get going in the business. But Beverly started having suspicions that something was wrong probably in around 2016. Well, there were suspicious things, but taken separately without everyone talking about their own experiences, it was hard to really put it together. She had written a check to her hair-taker Dawn that bounced. So she went down to her local chase branch to sort of find out what was going on. She wasn't getting paper statements in the mail, so she asked them to print out a number of her statements having to do with her checking account and her credit card account. So we went to the bank and asked for the statements. And she got a whole year and going through all of them, page by page by page. And it was there. She saw all sorts of charges that she said she did not the riser didn't know about. I was becoming very, very suspicious. I was starting to look in the money part, and that's what bothered me more when I saw that money was going. And I was not a big spender. Around the same time Dawn, she starts noticing Beverly's son, who lived in the condominium below her, came up with Evan with a shredder and started grabbing papers in her office area, including some with JP Morgan Letterhead, and just started sitting at the kitchen table just shredding documents over and over. Yeah, they came in one morning, they used to do it the back, through the back door, and they brought this shredder inside. And then they went in the drawers in the office and took out all the papers, and they started to do it. I was very suspicious because I know you don't go around and get in destroying papers. Beverly?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1583,2022-11-21 17:34:04
18970," The papers and they start to do it. I was very suspicious because I know you don't go around and get in this drawing papers. Beverly said that they had done this many times before. That's when she said to me, you know, Don, I'm going to write my feelings in this black book. Diary. And it's a diary and she started writing each day. She would write a little at a time. We run the holidays of 2018. The package had arrived. A FedEx package. And in it were materials about a venture capital fund based out of the Cayman Islands. Don and some other family members take a look at this. And they see that Beverly is signed up for this fund to the tune of $5 million over the course of several years. And that was really the beginning of it. That was sort of the tip of the iceberg when it became obvious that something was going on that my grandmother really wasn't aware of this fund. You know, Beverly started to panic. She was got really upset and called, you know, JP Morgan's headquarters in New York and asked for Jamie Diamond. She said she was told someone would call her back. But she says that that never happened. She wrote a letter to Evan and Avi. And in there, she laid out a number of things that were concerning her on authorized trading, the checking account she had about a million dollars worth of jewelry in a safe deposit box. And that her son Bobby had the key to that box. And that that jewelry had gone missing. All this was kind of packaged in this, you know, five-page handwritten of Memantor Will and Trust. The jewelry is gone. But why it happened? There have been a lot of different stories. You just don't take your mother's wonderful things and hand it out. And they email that note to JP Morgan to seize all activity under account. And they ended up setting off a firestorm after that. As soon as they got this email that there was a season to assist and that she wanted to send her money and change brokerage firms, they were actually vacationing one floor below downstairs through there right now. The next day Beverly's in her place. The granddaughter's still in her place visiting. Dawn is there and up comes Bobby kind of barging through the door. And he's screaming about what was sent to the JP Morgan. They're now investigating now. And he's furious. Takes his mother and sort of puts her into a chair, gets pen and paper. And she says physically forced her to write a retraction letter. They were pushing me around. It was a scary time. I was really afraid too. I had to take her to the doctor and she did an x-ray because she was in so much pain. The locks had to be changed. The phone number had to be changed. I really thought we were going to have to hire guards to be outside just for protection. Oh, it was terrible. A horrible scene. Beverly brought her case before the financial industry regulatory authorities. Usually known as Finra. It took several months' hearings. She sees all sorts of transactions that's going on. Hundreds of them that she claims that she never knew about, never authorized. But yet we're logged to JP Morgan's files as having been direct requests from her. That included the sale of a large amount of Apple stock worth several million dollars as well as all her stock in big lots. You know, over the course of their time with JP Morgan, Evan and Avi were making all sorts of trading on her account that was generating millions of dollars in commissions for themselves in the bank. Yet she was not sort of getting any of the type of gains that you would expect sort of an 80 million dollar account in a bullish market to be able to get. They issued a ruling entirely in her favor finding that her grandsons as well as JP Morgan, they were liable for violating their fiduciary duty, misrepresenting themselves. And they also found that the bank and her grandson, Evan, were liable for elder of you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1584,2022-11-21 17:38:17
18971," viable for violating their fiduciary duty, misrepresenting themselves. And they also found that the bank and her grandson, Evan, reliable for elder abuse. Evan and Avi, they were fired from JP Morgan. They issued an award of about $19 million. I reached out for a comment and JP Morgan emphasized that Evan and Avi were no longer with the firm and that their actions do not represent the sort of values of the bank. I reached out to Evan and Avi, heard back from their lawyer, saying that they disagree with the law and the facts that Finra kind of used to decide the case against them and are seeing if they can have it withdrawn. Her son, Bobby, wrote her a letter. Said his son's weren't criminals. And he also admits to taking her jewelry. And he says he needed it to pay off some bad business debts he had. They never once came up to say, I'm sorry. If there had been an apology and some acceptance and asking for forgiveness from my grandmother, I don't think we'd be in the position that we are now. Since the piece came out, we've received dozens of messages from people, many of whom are telling their own sort of personal tales of kind of financial advisors on bad or family members who got control of in a state and abused those within. Seems that it's really resonated with a lot of people. I keep hearing a lot of feedback about Beverly and how a lot of people feel she did the right thing. You're never too old to stand up for yourself and try to write an injustice. She was adamant that she wanted to stand up for herself. But at the end of the day, they did wrong. It's a painful life lesson. Beverly taught them that you don't mess with grandma. On April 20th, oil markets did something they never had before and they crashed into negative territory and closed the day at minus $40. Meanwhile, in a place called Thaden Boyce in Essex, a group of nine traders led by a guy called Cuddles made $660 million over the course of a couple of hours. The price of oil has collapsed to a record low. We've never really seen anything like it. WTI this morning down more than 35%. People maybe wouldn't have been so surprised if the oil price had fallen to zero. But the oil price went to minus 38. It went far lower than anyone had expected. And so lots of people in the market were saying, well, hang on, something else is going on here. A couple of months later, I started to get wind through a network of sources that a tiny firm in the outskirts of London had made a huge amount of money that day and potentially had some parts to play in what happened. The information we got was that nine traders at Vega Capital London had made in the region of $660 million in one day. As a group, I think they made as much money in one day as Apple makes from its international sales in one day. I mean, it's an insane sum of money. Did they pull off a fantastic trade? Did they predict the way the market was moving and get it absolutely right? Or was there something else going on and had they actually done something that breached market rules in a bid to sort of push the market? And that investigation is ongoing.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1585,2022-11-21 17:42:37
18972," So Paul Cummins is a trader who cut his teeth in the pits in the 80s and 90s when everyone had a nickname, his was Cuddles. If you can imagine that was a very sort of cut throat type of world where people are doing you know hundreds of thousands and millions of dollar trades by shouting at each other, giving hand signals and then sort of scrolling on scraps of paper. The culture of the trading pits in London was very influenced by the working class guys who became traders there. They weren't like the city bankers that had gone before them. They weren't usually Oxford or Cambridge, they didn't wear several rose suits. They were ordinary working guys who happened to have a talent for trading and a lot of them came from Essex. I think it was 400 traders in the pits and Cuddles in his all in gas pit was described to us as amongst the top three in amongst that. It was very successful and made very large amounts of money as a young man. But you know inevitably mechanisation and the arrival of electronic markets was the kind of death knell for the pits and in 2005 the IPE closed down. And when the pits shut down a lot of the traders who worked there, lost their jobs or quits or went to work for financial institutions, pull commons decided to start his own trading collective out in Essex. Some of them are ex-pick guys, cut from the same cloth as him, lots of them are actually in their twenties and they're drinking buddies son or their own kids, friends from football. Their young lads, hungry and ambitious and he brings them into the fold. And fairly shortly he's got maybe a dozen or so traders that are independent. They just be clear but they're all part of this collective. Yeah I'll let Liam do with Essex. I am from Essex so I feel like I'm free to get into it. Wait as I say. If you were to ask someone in Britain how they would imagine a Essex person they would see someone who's maybe slightly flamboyant with a cockney accent, a guy richy style accent. You know not afraid to splash the cash but it's probably pretty bright and has done well for themselves. Don't even make sense does it? But you know these guys they drove around very nice rolls, roises and bent leaves, they went to places like Marbaeur on holiday. Fade and voice is a very wealthy place. You have to have considerable income to be able to afford to live in that village. It's a really nice place to live and it's 20 minutes to Cheebride away from the city. Earlier in the summer we have this lead which is that there's this tiny firm called Vega Capital London and they were the biggest winners from the biggest oil crash in history. Anyone that covers markets is going to be surprised about that. You know you're thinking you're BP's of the world or you're Glen Cors but is this tiny firm? And one of the big challenges that we had was actually finding out who worked with Vega Capital. It wasn't immediately obvious and at first we had absolutely no idea. If you go to the Vega Capital website it says it's under construction. If you do basic online searching it's very difficult to find anyone who's publicly connected to the company. So inevitably we're incredibly curious at this point like who the hell are these people? The more reporting we did the more it became clear that this group were connected socially as well as professionally. They went to weddings together, they played golf together, they would go and holiday together. We found out that a number of them were members of the West Ham supporters club in London. A few of them started companies together so you could see all the connections between them and start to see a distinct group emerging. And it really just was this kind of shock that you know this wasn't just like a hedge fund or a firm you'd never heard of. This was actually a group of buddies who all had the same experience on this day and had all made a huge amount of money. We'll move wherever it takes to stay ever because on that one but uh its not really sure thetilio's life a pretty high risk of the",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1586,2022-11-21 17:47:06
18973," This was actually a group of buddies who all had the same experience on this day and had all made a huge amount of money. So if you're an oil trader there's a number of different ways you can trade and probably the most popular is WTI futures contracts. And it's basically a contract that says, I'm going to buy a thousand barrels of oil from you at this point in the future or I'm going to sell a thousand barrels of oil to you at this point in the future. This is actually just a financial contract to gamble on to predict where the oil is going to go up or down. On the 20th of April in Essex there have been signals for a while that this was going to be an exceptional day in oil markets and we know that some of them arose early and started their trading in the early hours of the morning while it was still dark outside. Essentially what they were doing is buying contracts that gave them an obligation to buy oil at whatever the price ended up at 2.30pm. So they're basically placing a bet that oil was going to fall throughout the day. But they're simultaneously selling lots of oil as well and whether they make a profit and how much profit they make is the difference between what they buy the oil for and what they sell the oil for. Now of course we now know throughout April 20th the price dropped and dropped. So this is going very well for them. You know they are committed to selling oil at these prices and the prices are continuing to fall which means they're going to be able to offset it and buy oil at cheaper at the end of the day. Now once it gets to kind of 1.30pm that's when things start to get really interesting. Suddenly there's a kind of influx of buyers and sellers you know as desperation increases in the market and trading volumes go up. Now at 2.08pm exactly something bizarre and unprecedented happened which is the oil passes into negative territory and it fell to a record level of minus $38. We've never seen anything like a period in terms of the contraction of the global economy. That huge gulf between what they were buying the oil for and what they were selling it for and able them to make more money than they ever thought possible. So their profit was the difference between minus 37 and all of these positive numbers on every contract they sold. The price of crude briefly hit minus $37 a barrel. For one group of traders operating from a small office it was a very very profitable day. It's important to remember this had never happened before in the history of oil trading. No one could have predicted it. I can't think of another example of where you enter a trader you get paid on both sides. You get paid both to sell and to buy. You know it's unthinkable. One thing we know about the cuddles trading arcade is that they were very comfortable taking large risks and you know you have to be clear this was a large risk. Yeah we spoke to oil traders, both people that know these guys and people that don't and they all say that this is incredibly risky. And that's actually what stops a lot of oil traders doing trading like this. They simply aren't willing to stomach the risk. But cuddles and his friends were. So when the kind of final calculations came down the group of the nine most profitable traders made $660 million or thereabouts between them. I mean if you can imagine I think three or four of them made in excess of a hundred million each. One of the astonishing things about this trade is that two of the individuals who made more than a hundred million dollars in a single day were in their twenties. One of them was 22 years old. You know in a few years earlier he'd been posted on his social media about doing teenage stuff with his mates in town and going to see girls and rap music and here he is a few years later making a hundred million dollars in a single day's trading. When we and Liam discovered that we were just we couldn't believe it we couldn't believe what we were seeing. All trading is a zero sum game. Anytime you're making money as an oil trader someone else is losing it. Amongst the biggest losers were the investors in this Chinese fund, crude oil treasure fund. There were thousands of them and they lost everything. Lots of people have put their savings into oil funds. They lost money that day. Big banks and brokers who sort of stand in the middle of trading parties they lost money that day. Another interesting thing is that oil producing countries like Q8 or Canada.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1587,2022-11-21 17:51:18
18974," Kingston Brokers, who stand in the middle of trading parties, they lost money that day. And another interesting thing is that oil producing countries like Q8 or Canada, they sell oil as an average of the WTI closing price over the preceding month. So the fact that one of those numbers in that average was minus 37, men, if you can imagine, countries like Saudi Arabian Q8 potentially lost a couple of dollars on every single barrel of oil they sold that month. Vega Capital's traders made such an extraordinary sum of money that it was inevitable there would be some scrutiny of what they did, but it wasn't just the sums of money they made. In the vital half an hour before the settlement price was set, they were by far the biggest sellers of oil futures in the market, which is an incredible thing to think about when you consider that the other participants in that oil market are going to be the world's biggest banks, you know, oil majors, BP and Shell, and here you have a group of nine guys in Essex who are having this significant influence over a global market for oil. I mean, I think you have to assume that if these guys have made seven million or ten million dollars, they probably would be celebrating in Essex right now. But the fact that they made closer to 700 million has meant that they are facing understandable scrutiny. We wrote individually to all the Vega traders who did exceptionally well that day, and we got a letter in response from a law firm representing the group. The law firm was at pains to point out, number one, that they haven't been accused of any wrongdoing, that they all traded independently and separately, and they basically all made up their own mind that this was what was going to happen in oil markets based on publicly available knowledge and decided to execute this trade. What I love about these stories is there's a real variance of opinion, and some people will look at what happened and think that must be dodgy. They all traded at the end of the day, they all made a huge amount of money while all these people lost. That's shocking, but lots of people say these guys are acute disadvantage. They're in a market that's inhabited by, you know, huge technology driven, funds and firms and oil giants that have got all the advantages in the world, and when you get a bunch of Essex geezers who essentially beat the market and find a way to make a huge amount of money, they should get a pat on the back really because that's the dream. Since this happened, a lot of the guys have stopped trading the monthly settlements that they've done so well out in the past. Several of them have set up new companies. They've essentially gone very quiet. You know, any kind of social media presence they had is, is kind of closed down. By all accounts there, you know, waiting this out. It's certainly too early to try and predict how the regulatory investigations are going to pan out. You know, we just don't know. There's a number of potential outcomes for these guys. You know, potential punishments, if there are any findings of manipulation against Vega or anyone affiliated with it, might be, you could be fine, you could be banned from trading, and you know, in most extreme cases, there have even been criminal prosecutions in the past of people who have been found to have been manipulating the settlement and misconduct related to trade settlement. There are other outcomes too. You know, one obvious one is going to be they're able to walk away from this life-changing trade with all the money that they made and celebrated as heroes in the trading community that, you know, they'll go down as legends. It's very important given the nature of the climate crisis right now for the general public to have an under.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1588,2022-11-21 17:55:38
18975," It's very important given the nature of the climate crisis right now for the general public to have an understanding of what progress is or is not actually happening. And I think many readers right now, they'll see these hundreds and hundreds of companies making these big bold climate claims. And they would be forgiven to think that, you know, we're well on our way to meeting the emission reduction trajectory we need to be on. And the reality of the matter is we're just not on that trajectory. And a key reason for this sort of disconnect is the use of offsets that aren't doing what they claim to be doing. We have a massive potential for sort of willful blindness. We can convince ourselves of things regardless of what the facts are. And so that's what tends to happen in these cases. It's not that it's not that anybody is setting out to commit climate fraud. They sort of walk themselves into a situation and they convince themselves of one thing and that allows them to convince themselves of another thing. But at the end of the day, they're doing something that makes no sense at all. My name is Ben Elgin. I wrote the story about how the billion dollar market for carbon offsets is setting back the fight against climate change. So one of the challenges in reporting on carbon offsets and trying to figure out what's going on is really finding good experts who have been steeped in this marketplace and are willing to candidly talk about it. One of the best people for this is a fellow named Mark Trexler. And I've been talking to him for more than a decade. My name is Mark Trexler. I've worked in climate change for the last 30 years. I was actually hired by the World Resources Institute in Washington to work on the first carbon offset project in 1988. In terms of defining a carbon offset, one of the beauties, so to speak, of greenhouse gases, the silver lining of greenhouse gases, when you put up a molecule of CO2 into the atmosphere, it can be anywhere in the planet in seven days. And therefore, if there's an option to reduce emissions on the other side of the planet, and you can do that very cheaply as compared to doing it in your factory, for example, then why not pay that person, that factory on the other side of the planet to reduce their emissions than you are in a sense offsetting your emissions? And the atmosphere doesn't really see your emissions anymore. So carbon offsets have been around for quite some time, and they were actually key with these international climate agreements, such as the Kyoto Protocol, which mandated the wealthiest countries, reduced their greenhouse gas emissions. The treaty was signed on the 11th of December 1997. Decided. The business community, in general, saw carbon offsets as a huge opportunity to comply with whatever policies and measures might be coming down the pike on climate change, much more cost effectively. We've seen a huge surge in companies making big proclamations about how they're going carbon neutral or zeroing out all of their carbon emissions. We're going to reduce our carbon footprint to net zero. Unilever is committing to net zero emissions. We can achieve a net zero emissions world. We began looking at these corporate claims of dramatically reduced emissions, and we noticed so many of these companies were using carbon offsets to achieve these aims. And as we began to look at the carbon offset projects themselves, what we found is that the environmental benefits claimed by these companies are not actually what they seem to be. As we sort of saw and spotted a number of these very aggressive carbon offset projects which appeared to be generating inflated credits or bogus credits, we saw a number of them were associated with the nature conservancy. This surprised us. Safe in high jednaks owned in one",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1589,2022-11-21 18:00:03
18976," They did credits or bogus credits. We saw a number of them were associated with the Nature Conservancy. This surprised us. The Nature Conservancy is the world's biggest environmental group. They have about a billion dollars a year in revenues. And they've been around for seven decades. They've preserved about 125 million acres of land. And they've done so many good works over the years. And they've been very strong in terms of working with corporate partners. The Nature Conservancy has taken a different approach, a very pragmatic and pro-business approach. They will not go out and criticize a big polluter. But they're very happy to work with them. Some might say that, well, that's selling out. But others would say, and those at the Nature Conservancy would say, these companies have deep pockets. They can help fund important preservation work. And we have absolutely no problem working with them on this stuff. So companies are very warm. And they've partnered with the Nature Conservancy for many years. And yeah, it definitely lends a sheen of credibility to these projects. Here is 20 nears. This is the business of Disney World this year. One, two, three, four. If you look at, for instance, Disney. That's a sprawling company with theme parks and cruise lines that burn up diesel fuel. They have office buildings and television studios that consume electricity. So these companies are trying to make major, major reductions in their carbon footprints. But it's very difficult to change these fundamental ways their businesses operate. So Disney has been a big buyer of carbon offsets that are orchestrated by the Nature Conservancy. One of the projects that they buy from is called Pennsylvania Riges. And that's a plot of land. Most of the land is actually about a three-hour drive outside of Philadelphia. Interestingly, this land, 3,000 of these acres, was actually acquired by the Nature Conservancy in the late 1990s. This land was imminently threatened. There was a pending logging contract on this land. So they do what they have done so well for all of these years, which is they go out. They raise money from local philanthropists and they go buy this land to protect it from developers and loggers. And at the time, according to an archive version of the Nature Conservancy's website, when they were proudly announcing this deal, they said these threats have been abated because of this acquisition by the Nature Conservancy. So it's really interesting now, fast forward two decades to earlier this year when they put forward this carbon project. And if you look through it, this land is a key part of that carbon project. And what they're now saying is this land is now, once again, imminently threatened. 72% of the trees are going to be cut within five years. Now, this is just astounding because this land is owned by the Nature Conservancy. They do not clear-cut land that they've bought through philanthropic donations. So this scenario that they've put forward to get carbon revenues is not really plausible. And what that means is when you have Disney coming and buying these credits, when it eventually lowers its carbon footprint because of these credits, well, that won't be a credible or truthful claim by Disney. So this is an organization that truly understands the threat of the issue of climate change and is wanting to do its part to address this. However, in this situation, it just appears they're drive, which they've had for decades, to increase the amount of revenues that it can use for land preservation work. Nature Conservancy and many others see that carbon credits as a pot of money that they can tap into to further their own benevolent aims. But unfortunately, what this has resulted in is claims of climate progress that just aren't really happening. So the Nature Conservancy defends vigorously these deals, and they and others will say, look,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1590,2022-11-21 18:04:20
18977," So the Nature Conservancy defends vigorously these deals and they and others will say, look, our projects are just following the rules that these registries set up. So, somewhat also put some of the blame on the registries themselves because they're setting up the rules which allow these vapid projects to get up and sold. So, we've reached out to all of the companies we mentioned in this story including Disney, they didn't want to be interviewed for this story but they all told us that, look, we have to rely on the experts out there and those experts they say are these carbon registries that have been set up. Most of these nature conservancy deals are set up and sold on this exchange it's called the American Carbon Registry. Now it's the oldest of these registries that allow voluntary carbon credits to be sold. They've been around since 1996. What these offset registries do is they set up rules and any carbon offset project has to follow those rules but there's this tension that's always there. If the rules are too strict then it's going to be very hard for carbon offset projects to get up and running. So there's this balance going on where the registries want rules that attract projects but they don't want it to be so strict where it will disincentivize projects from getting listed. One of the challenges with designing carbon offset systems is that there are normally two people at the table. You have buyers and you have sellers and to some extent you have policy makers but but the buyers and the sellers are really the ones with the expertise with the incentive to really participate hard make a lot of things happen. And the challenge there is is that both of them sort of want the same thing or they're both happy with the same thing. They're happy with low cost offsets and a lot of them because that works for their business model. You end up though with nobody really representing the atmosphere so to speak. Nobody's really representing the climate in those discussions and so the policies end up biasing the whole system and you end up in sort of a race to the bottom and that's what we've seen happen. When it comes specifically to the topic of carbon offsets, I am a fan of carbon offsets in the sense that they can help mitigate climate change. They absolutely can. But if we're not going to do it correctly in a way that actually does help mitigate climate change, then it's nothing but a distraction. And after 30 years you have to start wondering is it really just a distraction? And that's really unfortunate but that's where we are. Ultimately what needs to be what needs to happen is systemic change. We're sort of nibbling around the edges with some of these different things. We need to change how we produce energy. We need to change how we transport ourselves. We need to change what and how we eat. We need systemic change associated with transitioning to a low carbon economy. A lot of what we're doing today is not promoting systemic change. It's sort of trying to stick your thumb in the dike to preserve the current system and at the end of the day that can't really work.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1591,2022-11-21 18:08:41
18978," The Hyperloop. There's a good chance you've heard the name by now. This is the Hyperloop system. It can take people hundreds of miles in minutes. The Hyperloop is a series of tubes that would transport people in pods at ultra high speeds over long distances. This is a remarkable new form of transportation that can whisk people from city to city in a flash. 29 minutes from New York to DC, 30 minutes from LA to San Francisco. For years we've been seeing these futuristic utopian renderings of some cross between a spaceship and a monorail. But lately the Hyperloop is becoming much more real. It was surreal to be even sitting inside a Hyperloop and just even more incredible to actually be like riding down a track in something that was nothing more than a crazy idea six years before. Companies all around the world have been developing and testing the technology needed to propel passengers of speeds of over 1000 kilometers per hour. But for many, speed is only the first step to unlocking the full transformational effects of a new mode of transportation. Fast is what we just sort of take for granted in the Hyperloop world. It's the network effects that really deliver the benefit and that opens up a completely different scale of economic opportunity. We've got planes, trains, automobiles and boats. We're getting around earth. But what if there was a fifth mode and I have a name for it, which is called the Hyperloop? The Hyperloop? Yeah. In 2013 while riding high on the growing success of Tesla and SpaceX, entrepreneur Elon Musk released a white paper outlining the basic framework of the technology he called Hyperloop. The basic idea goes a little something like this. A tube reduces the air pressure to a near vacuum like environment. A Hyperloop pod is then suspended in the tube, usually by magnetic levitation. The whole pod can then be propelled forward. Because there's no traditional friction sources like air resistance or rolling friction that would push back against the pod, the Hyperloop is able to move at incredibly high speeds and do so fairly efficiently. Despite its futuristic name, however, the general concept behind Hyperloop is actually pretty old. In fact, New York City's first attempt at an underground public transit system in the 1870s was based on a similar principle. The pneumatic transit system was short-lived, however, only stretching one block and topping out at a rather leisurely 10 miles per hour. While Elon would make some 21st century improvements to this concept and bestow a very 21st century name, he wouldn't end up pursuing the technology itself. Instead, electing to focus his efforts on something a little bit deeper, literally digging the requisite tunnels by a his boring company. It would take another billionaire industrialist who dabbles in spaceflight. No way, not that one. Yeah, that's the one. After Richard Branson would make a large investment in the company Hyperloop 1, it would be renamed to Virgin Hyperloop. What we've always been trying to do as a company is show that this technology could work, that it could be made safe, and that ultimately it's something that's happening in the next couple of years, not the next 20 years. Josh Geigel is the co-founder and CEO of Virgin Hyperloop. In a familiar tech startup story, he's seen the project go from a garage to a large-scale testing facility outside of Las Vegas. So we started building the first kind of Hyperloop system in 2016. We've done a lot of work about 500 tests that we've done in that...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1592,2022-11-21 18:13:07
18979," Our scale testing facility outside of Las Vegas. So we started building the first kind of Hyperloop system in 2016. We've done a lot of work, about a 500 tests that we've done on that over the last five years. And what we realize that we need to do is take that technology, show that it can be commercial. So drive the cost down, improve the efficiency, improve the performance. But the key thing is, you know, is actually making it approachable and safe for individuals. In order to do that, Josh, along with Virgin's head of passenger experience, Saralucian, bravely volunteer to take the inaugural ride. What her and I were realizing is like, we're the first two people sitting in a Hyperloop. The only type of people that have gone through this environment are in spaces. And there we are in just like normal clothes because of the system, the safety of what we designed. Three, two, one, launch. And then once we started going, you felt a bit of acceleration. We accelerated a little bit harder than we would in commercial. Be like a sports car. Yeah. We got about 108 miles an hour on that test. And it's a short run. It's about 500 yards or so. And came to a stop. The test lasting only about 20 seconds and covering only a quarter of a mile at just over 100 miles per hour. Is a long way away from a true functioning Hyperloop. But as for optics, it's a crucial step for the future of funding. The number one question we got from investors or from project proponents or just people in general was like, is a Hyperloop safe? And what better way to show something is safe than by actually getting people on it? But convincing investors and governments that would likely be fronting some of the construction costs for an unproven technology, there's no easy task. First and foremost is the question of safety. Most people don't know how an airplane works, but yet they get on an airplane. They get on an airplane because it's faster than driving. And most importantly, they've probably gotten off of one before. They've seen someone get off of one before. And so what we set out to do was actually show that Hyperloop could be safe with two normal people, not astronauts, not adrenaline junkies or test pilots or anything like that. Two normal people getting on a Hyperloop. And then most importantly, those two people getting off. But beyond safety concerns, constructing Hyperlubs will undoubtedly require a significant capital investment. To the estimated tune of around $60 million US dollars per kilometer of track. So a track from San Francisco to Los Angeles, for example, is likely to come with a price tag over $10 billion. And before large governments are willing to come in in front of those costs, investors who are funding Hyperloop development must accept it as a long term mixture of technology and infrastructure investing. Investors that are used to short returns because you're developing apps or something to that effect, those aren't the investors that really get excited about Hyperloop. What you start to see is the people that are looking at platform technologies. So this idea that because this smartphone existed, Uber could exist. So who are the Vanderbilts of this century? And that's the part where you're going to get a lot more nose than yeses. But those people that have the ability, the fortitude to stick it out to see the game changing platform here, those are the people that we're looking for. And since we've done that passenger test, there has been a lot of interest that's really, oh, this is a lot sooner than I thought. Invisiting the ripple effects of what Hyperloop could achieve, those are fairly challenging at this stage of development. It's fast, yes, but for point to point, travel traditional maglev trains can move pretty fast as well. And outside of China, South Korea and Japan, even those haven't seen much adoption elsewhere due to the high costs and questionable profitability. The Shanghai line in China, for example, loses around $100 million every year. Hyperloop companies, however, believe they can offer something different than true.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1593,2022-11-21 18:17:24
18980," Shanghai Line in China, for example, loses around $100 million every year. Hyperloop companies, however, believe they can offer something different than traditional railway lines. My name is Alan James, and as far as I know, I'm the only guy on the planet who's written the government level business case for 300 kmh conventional high speed rail, 500 kmh maglev and 1000 kmh hyperloop. It's fundamentally about moving people from where they are, to where they want to go, when they want to make those journeys, and doing it in much smaller numbers. So pod designs for hyperloop range from 12 to 28 seats typically. Why are they small? It's because small enables the network to operate flexibly. And a great example of that is the East West strategic route across the north of England, from Liverpool to Manchester to Leeds. So to get from Liverpool via Manchester to Leeds by train is just short of two hours today. It'll probably take you two hours driving as well in average traffic conditions. That result is those three city regions remain three separate entities. Liverpool Manchester Leeds, there's very little commuting traffic between those urban areas. Hyperloop absolutely changes that from the ground up. Liverpool to Manchester is a five or six minute journey. Manchester to Leeds is also a five or six minute journey. What effectively does is create a single super city economy. In this vision, the Hyperloop acts a little more like a highway, where pods have fixed destinations and don't need to stop along the way. Meaning you can travel on a Hyperloop network from, say, Liverpool to Leeds, while the pod behind you travels from Liverpool to Manchester. And if that Metro Hyperloop network is connected to other networks from the same location, you could travel from Liverpool to Paris or Liverpool to Amsterdam, all without making a single stop. For passengers, for business, for leisure, that is utterly transformational. For high-value freight and logistics, it's equally transformation. But critically, if you do a Hyperloop network at scale, you begin to deliver massively significant carbon savings to it. A multi-regional Hyperloop network could become a replacement for both short haul passenger and cargo flights and traditional ground transportation, both of which are significant carbon producers. One Hyperloop-connected distribution hub, perhaps at an airport that is predominantly used for international air freight, replacing maybe 10, 12, 15 distributed road hubs. It takes a lot of polluting and inefficient truck haulage off the roads. That itself means roads gain extra capacity. Hyperlubes will still need to use electricity to both move pods and maintain the near- vacuum environment and the tube. Proponents of the technology believe that this can be done by using renewable sources, including a combination of solar panels and battery technology that could be used along the Hyperloop itself. But even with all multipliers of time and carbon emission savings that a Hyperloop network may provide, the investment capital required to actually build such a network becomes even more economically and politically daunting. Committing doesn't mean spending billions on day one. Committing means how do we phase it? One company in the Netherlands is working to develop that technology and perhaps more importantly, the international coalition needed to make the Hyperloop network a reality. So we are here in Europe's first full-scale Hyperloop test facility where we can already prove every conceptual technology of the Hyperloop.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1594,2022-11-21 18:21:39
18981," So we are here in Europe's first full-scale high-ploot test facility, where we can already prove every conceptual technology of the Hyperloop. This is Tim Houter, a co-founder and CEO of Heart Hyperloop, headquartered in the city of Delft. And while this testing tube might not seem as large as others, inside is a key technology to create the on and off-ramp type infrastructure of a Hyperloop network, that is, a lane switch. That's something we can already test here. You can actually see it here. That the track is diverging from one track into two. It makes it possible to eventually split up the Hyperloop track in two sections. And in that sense, you can create a complete high-ploot network that in the end will make it possible to travel, for example, over a whole continent. I think Europe, for example, with the same ease as you can now travel with a metro in the city. The nice thing about this magnetic levitation system that we have developed is that there's absolutely zero moving components in the track. So, for example, if you have to do a lane switch, all you do is that the tube basically splits up. And statically, the tracks also split up. And whenever the vehicle enters a switch, it either pulls itself to the right with its magnets or pulls itself to the left with its magnets. Lane switching on traditional rail requires the physical movement of the rail. Even modern magnetic levitation tracks use lane switching techniques in order to transfer trains from one track to another. And this is a very crucial element, because this is the thing that limits the capacity and in the end, the usefulness of the real network. Because the moment that a track is switching, that means that at that moment you are creating an unsafe environment for the trains behind it. So you need a lot of space between trains. Then a high point because you have no moving components in the track. All the vehicles can be much closer to each other. You can achieve a very high frequency, and basically have vehicles moving and merging in and out of the network very much like a highway. For now though, heart's physical testing has been limited by the size of their tube. Because the test track is only 30 meters long, they haven't tested this lane switch at speeds greater than 20 kilometers per hour. However, the company is working to build a new test site, where it plans to increase that testing speed to 300 kilometers per hour. We're now in a phase where we have proven most of the most important technologies in the test facilities that we already have. And we have also demonstrated the viability and the feasibility of a network. If you look at all the top systems that it consists of, most of those are proven systems already demonstrated in lab conditions. So we don't really believe that the technology itself is going to be the biggest challenge. Because for all Hyperloop companies out there, actually building a Hyperloop system requires more than just a good product. We're talking about the safety aspects. We're talking about integration into the environment. We're talking about social aspects to people feel comfortable traveling in such a system. So it's about all these different aspects. And the complexity is really getting all the different stakeholders that are relevant and that they need to contribute to bring this to market. To get them all following the same roadmap. In order to help build this coalition of private and public interest in Hyperloop development, heart in 2018 partnered with other Hyperloop companies from Europe and Canada. The goal was to define, establish and standardize the framework to regulate Hyperloop systems. Right now we are working with all the Hyperloop developers together in setting up the first, let's say a structure for starting the start standards.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1595,2022-11-21 18:26:04
18982," Working with all the Hyperloop developers together in setting up the first, let's say, a structure for starting the standards drafting. One of the most important goals for HART is interoperability, which is essentially making sure the different systems can communicate with each other. Interoperability is so important because what we want to achieve is actually have this seamless travel experience. So you don't want to end up, for example, going from Madrid to Paris and then switching because you need to use a different technology to get, for example, to Amsterdam. The idea being that as companies around Europe create the first commercial Hyperloop tracks between individual cities, one day those can all be connected to a larger network. Everyone that believes that Hyperloop is a future transport system also realizes that there is a need to have this network because that's where Hyperloop thrives. Hyperloop is such a huge project. It's definitely not something that you can do in your own or as a single company. So you need to do it with a lot of other companies. You need to have the governments. I think in that sense, the biggest challenge that we've encountered is to really get all the required parties together to take the steps in development and in commercial implementation. Our next plan is to build the European Hyperloop Center, an open testing facility which will include a 2.6 kilometer test track, and the company hopes to test travel speeds there at up to 700 kilometers per hour. Virgin Hyperloop is also racing to construct the first commercial Hyperloop route, with projects in various states of development in India, Saudi Arabia, and the United States. Recently the company announced plans to build a Hyperloop certification center in West Virginia, which will include a 6 mile long test track. Proving the technology here will be crucial if Hyperloop networks can find a home among infrastructure investments that the Biden administration hopes to make. The idea that there's multiple Hyperloop companies, I think is a redeeming aspect in the business. People really want to see something happen, so having multiple people move forward is good for that. I was struck when Josh and Sarah rode the pod. Two or three of the major outlets used the phrase, we now have a new mode of transport. And although all of that technology had existed before those two human beings rode it, it was the moment at which those two human beings traveled that short distance down the tube that in popular imagination Hyperloop became a mode of transport. The metaphor I use with my team is that the Wright Brothers refers, but none of us fly on Wright Brothers Airlines anymore. If you don't continue to innovate, you're not going to be around and so we'll continue to be at the forefront of building our boot. Back in 2013, Elon had an idea. I think the difference now in 2021 is some brilliant engineers have spent real time grinding out the details. And I thoroughly expect the next three to five years to be decisive.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1596,2022-11-21 18:30:29
18983," They've been terrorizing Clever Normal. Good Walking. Being Cannot柏 Two F Accounting ZX Right Sane This week, how hydrogen can transform our energy usage. We'll look at why the universe's most abundant element could be a game changer in the climate revolution. Hydrogen technologies are not new. They are used in other sectors. We use them in space on our rockets. And we don't need the laws of physics to change to be able to use hydrogen on our planes. From iron ore to green hydrogen, one of Australia's richest men tells us about his pivot to sustainable energy. Let's take action. It's practical. It's intramedical. Let's do it now. Plus, the hydrogen revolution. We'll speak with the CEO of Italian Utility Sperm Snam about his new book and how green hydrogen could be competitive within five years. Cossero are coming down and people are waking up to the fact that it's the only way to decarbonize certain sectors. From Bloomberg's Global Headquarters in New York, I'm Kaylee Limes and this is Bloomberg Green. It's a new year, so here at Bloomberg Green we're highlighting new solutions in the fight against climate change. And one of those is as old as the universe itself. Hydrogen. It's the simplest element around but could well be a game changer when it comes to turning around our dependence on fossil fuels. Today, hydrogen is used in the chemicals industry to produce petroleum products. It's also starting to be used in steel production and industry under a lot of pressure to decarbonize. But it has far more uses as well, from powering cars to heating our homes. And Bloomberg New Energy Finance sees a seismic shift in the sector in the next ten years as green hydrogen squeezes out dirtier alternatives. So-called grey hydrogen dominates today. But as renewable electricity gets cheaper and more accessible, so we'll green hydrogen. In this week's edition of Bloomberg Green, we'll explore what this push into hydrogen means for tackling climate change. We'll be here from Australian billionaire Twiggy Forest about his pivot from iron ore to hydrogen, and we'll also speak with the CEO of Italian utility company Snam about his book, The Hydrogen Revolution. But first, what are we using hydrogen for? And why does it actually matter? Christine Lee Edwards explains. Hydrogen, the most plentiful element in the universe. On Earth, we find it mostly bonded to oxygen in the form of water. Hydrogen gas is known as hydrocarbons. Hydrogen gas, H2, burns hot and clean, making it an attractive tool in the race to net zero. But isolating hydrogen from other elements is no easy task. Today, the cheapest way to do this is via chemical processes that break up natural gas. This releases a lot of carbon dioxide. Another method is to use electricity to split water molecules in a process called electrolysis. Although there is no carbon byproduct, a lot of electricity is needed. And if this power comes from burning coal or gas, it negates the zero emissions goals of using hydrogen to begin with. How did you do it?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1597,2022-11-21 18:34:54
18984," The electricity is needed. And if this power comes from burning coal or gas, it negates the zero emissions goals of using hydrogen to begin with. Hydrogen produced in this way, power by fossil fuels, is called grey hydrogen. If carbon capture and storage is used together with fossil fuels, then it becomes blue hydrogen. If nuclear power is used, it's called pink. And finally, green hydrogen is what is produced via electrolysis and powered from renewable sources. This method is considered emissions-free. It's predicted that by the early 2030s, H2 made from renewables will be cheaper than that made from fossil fuels. But that hinges on the cost of electrolysis declining, which will be achieved through larger projects and an expansion of manufacturing. To be clear, vast amounts of H2 are already used today. Global production in 2018 totalled 117 million metric tons. This hydrogen is mostly used for its chemical properties, not as a source of energy, and very little of it is clean. Some sectors like steel could start using hydrogen for these chemical properties, replacing coal. Industries like cement and glass may also use hydrogen as a source of heat. Another advantage is its energy storage potential. It can be stored over long periods of time, and used when more power needs to be added to the grid. It also could hold an advantage over batteries and heavy transport and shipment. The promise of hydrogen for energy has been around since at least 1874, when Jules Verne wrote about it in his book, The Mysterious Island. But the future of hydrogen will depend on policy. Countries with net zero targets, carbon pricing and hydrogen strategies with investment mechanisms are likely to see the highest H2 demand. That was Bloomberg's Christine Lee Edwards explaining what hydrogen needs for the energy transition. But how are businesses approaching the sector? Well, one of Australia's richest men is making a big play into hydrogen. Andrew Forrest, better known as Twiggy, made his fortune from iron ore, being the chairman, former CEO and major shareholder in Fordousky metals. One of the world's biggest miners. But after having made over $10 billion in profit from the metal in the last fiscal year, Twiggy wants to transform Fordousky into a clean energy company. He's been scouring the planet in search of investment opportunities in hydrogen and renewables. The firm plans to allocate up to 10% of its annual profits for green energy investments, and is exploring projects across the globe from Indonesia to Argentina. Prancing Lockwa caught up with Twiggy Forest. There's only one type of clean hydrogen. All the rest is dirty. Yeah. That is green. If you just say, green hydrogen is clean, the rest is dirty, then you've actually nailed it. And, you know, anyone else who produces any other hydrogen, any other hydrogen, just looking at it and saying, why is global warming accelerating if anything you're saying is true? And then there's no actually, it's greenwashing. Yeah, but there's a lot of greenwashing because I keep on being told it's a transition. We can't just, you know, make the transition at a click of a finger. So what are we doing wrong? What can we do better? I don't remember the personal computer having to transition the typewriter. I really don't remember that. I don't remember the smartphone having to transition the pocket calculator and the old landline. You know, it's transition line is complete rubbish. The lie got put to it two days ago when JCP, a really loved British company, every right for the country to be proud of JCP. And, Portsky, I think a bit of a similar reputation, fantastic track record, everything super well from Portsky, huge balance sheet, super strong. When those two companies got together and agreed, a 79 billion USD green with per atom. Right? Then that's a real wake up call to say, hang on, greenhagen is obviously commercial now. You know, every other form of fossil fuel, fossil fuel, hydrogen, you know, it can compete with it on price. It can probably lose on price, but what we know, it is cooking the planet. And only greenhagen zero methane, zero carbon in the supply chain. Don't worry about the molecules in the supply chain. But at the moment, we're not even phasing out coal. I feel like at the G20 company case, so we have a long way to",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1598,2022-11-21 18:39:06
18985," I mean, zero carbon in the supply chain. Don't worry about the molecules in the supply chain. But at the moment, we're not even phasing out coal. If you look at the G20 company case, so we have a long way to go to talk about only using green hydrogen. Yeah, so look, I have a call, which I'd like to make now, that the world should not fund any more carbon-powered power stations, coal mining projects ever. We should wind them down as quickly as possible, because they are cutting the planet just like grey and growing hydrogen. It's gotten the planet blue. No. You know, hydrogen should not matter when you're going to electricity. It's releasing 10 to 16 times more carbon. Let one of the methane, which is worse, than it is hydrogen. So we've just got to stop doing things which are self-harming under the guise of green energy. So why are leaders so slow? Even if you look at the appetite for eSG investments, they're growing exponentially. So are emissions. So where are we allocating capital? OK, so take the recent G20. There was probably a reason why there wasn't strong action coming out of the G20, because people were not aware that major transactions between large companies were taking place now on green hydrogen, that actually this pollution free all the way to the supply chain fuel was now being transacted at multi-billion dollar scale. If they've known that, I don't believe any sovereign leader or any energy minister or climate change minister could not take ultra-seriously that green hydrogen is never here to stay. It's broken through. History has been made. It will never go back. OK, what is the one thing that you would tell leaders today and business leaders? How do we transition faster than what we are now? Because we're at real risk of missing our targets. Oh, so that's really simple. Do you stop funding? You stop subsidizing? Do you stop using money into cost? OK. It could be carbon sequestration. It could be fuel rebates could be anything. Hundreds of billions of dollars getting ashed. While we asked the planet on fossil fuel subsidies, because we haven't had that renewable energy, we haven't had that green hydrogen. It's kind of been pushed down, pushed down. It's also excuses are never be commercial. It can never be supplied into quantities we needed. I'm glad I'm glad. Now we know it. Let's take action. It's practical. It's implementable. Let's do it now. OK, if we do it now, is there going to be a shock to the energy system? Is there going to be a shock actually to economically? And is it worth not talking about transition? Just going from 8 to B? Yeah, it's a fantastic person. 8 to B is the solution. Let fossil fuels do what fossil fuels do. Just burn their coal, burn their oil, burn their gas. At least they're pumping up carbon and methane into the atmosphere, honestly. Well, not that honest because they don't mention methane, which is 90 times worse than carbon. But at least the carbon is being done honestly. Encourage the green hydrogen sector to come in really fast. OK, it's there. There's renewable power all over the world. We now know how to make electrolyzes much cheaper. 25% of the original cost. We know how to do that now. We don't have an excuse to get it. Does it need to be cheaper than oil and fossil fuel for it to be viable worldwide? Well, right now it is. OK, so let's just swallow that bit of financial data. Right now it is cheaper. And it's getting more check. It's the right fuel you know. Mr. Froskin. Just declining in value. You don't have enough of it, right? To power the world. Ah, yes. That's only because we haven't had policies to support. We had policies to support it five, 10 years ago. It would be everywhere. You'd see the global warming budget start to come down. Yeah. Now, we've got five or 10 years to make a huge difference. And it policy leaders all over the world to appreciate now. OK, big business is transacting with green hydrogen in multi-billion dollar agreements. We now know it's here and it's here to stay. It's relatively. Coming up on the program, the hydrogen revolution. We'll speak with the CEO of Italian utility firm, Snam, about his new book. And why he thinks green hydrogen will be competitive in just five years. Plus, how are airlines working to become more sustainable?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1599,2022-11-21 18:43:26
18986," a utility firm's name about his new book and why he thinks green hydrogen will be competitive in just five years. Plus, how are airlines working to become more sustainable? We'll look at how Airbus plans to step up in the climate fight. This is Bluebird Green. From Bloomberg's World Headquarters in New York, I'm Kayley Lines and this is Bluebird Green. What will the world look like in 2050? Will global temperatures have stabilized? Electric vehicles be abundant and solar and wind power homes around the world? According to Marco Alvera, the CEO of Italian Energy Company Snam, that vision of the future could be a reality. And he says that hydrogen will pave its way. As he tells it in his new book, The Hydrogen Revolution, Alvera's moment of reckoning came in November 2018 when he tasked the Snam scenarios team with studying how Europe could reduce its CO2 emissions to zero by 2050. Looking through the results of the study, Alvera said he was struck by how much hydrogen was in Europe's energy mix by that year. Beyond the abundance of hydrogen, the Snam model also predicted that it would be the cheapest form of decarbonized energy for many sectors and that it could be cheaper than today's prices for oil, coal and nuclear power. Armeria today has spoke with Alvera at COP26. It's happening all very fast. We see the cost of hydrogen coming down a lot. Hydrogen will play a big role in the energy mix. I don't know if it's going to be 15 or 25% of a fully decarbonized energy system, but it's going to be big. Coss are coming down and people are waking up to the fact that it's the only way to decarbonize certain sectors, so-called hard to abate sectors. And you say it's the only way in the cost are coming down. Where do you see prices moving? Because a lot of the reticence of times has to do with a pricing that some argue is still not the cheapest option out of the market. So when I was first working in hydrogen 2004, it was costing $1,000 per megawatt hour, $2,000, $1,600. Today, 100, and we see it going down to 50 in five years time and to going down to $25 per megawatt hour in the next 10 years or so. Which is a quarter of word as today. That's really because renewable energy, and we're talking green hydrogen here, renewable energy costs are falling, but the cost of making the electrolyzer, which is the kit that you use to convert solar or wind energy and water into-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1600,2022-11-21 18:47:51
18987," Renewable energy costs are falling, but the cost of making the electrolyzer, which is the kit that you use to convert solar or wind energy and water into hydrogen, the cost of this kit is falling a lot because it doesn't really exist on an industrial scale. So as we build up capacity, we industrialize it, we standardize it, and we squeeze costs out. That's really the cost trajectory. And for that, of course, you need demand, however, for governments and also institutions to kind of buy into this idea that it is a future we want to invest in creating infrastructure. What are they telling you? When you speak to governments, when you speak to officials, are they keen on this? They're very keen. So the Department of Energy shares our view in the states of getting to below $1 kilo, which is $25 megaveh an hour. The European Union has hydrogen strategy, which is very clear, and several member states have the same. Chila wants to export a lot of hydrogen. China's big on hydrogen. Australia's very big on hydrogen. Japan is blending already hydrogen. So I would say the world is now really focused on this because it's the only way to store energy for a long period of time economically, to convert it into either a liquid or a gas. And of course you talk about the price, but the other big component is the volume, how big can you go? Where do you see that on a time scale? So wherever it's sunny or windy, you can produce very cheap hydrogen eventually. And so compared to oil and gas, which are concentrated in a few parts of the world, it's going to be very democratic from that point of view. So every sunny place, every desert, every ocean wind can be turned into hydrogen that we can put on ships in pipes and really start trading it around the world. So it's going to happen a lot faster than a lot of people think. So and will you say a lot faster? What is that in time? As they said, $50, which is essentially oil parity within five years, and then depending on how quickly we ramp it up after that, we could get to $25, which is coal parity before the end of the day. And in big scale. In big scale, because once you get to coal parity, that's the only way we're going to get China and India to stop burning new coal. We have businesses in China and in India, and I see a lot of hydrogen development, a lot of renewable development in both countries. The Indian announcement was incredibly strong on 2030. Some people were upset about the 2017 at zero deadline, but when it comes to 30, he announced the big, big commitment to get the 50% renewables. Where is the price? I was surprised that they would make it so explicit, and even the net zero is a big thing for them. And so I think it will happen faster than 2070 because of the falling cost of renewable and hydrogen. India's burning 80 gigawatt of oil, diesel to keep the lights on. So there's an immediate opportunity there, and we're very interested in working that country. And with regards to China, perhaps the fact that we haven't really seen them active, I guess the diplomats are working on this, but we haven't really seen the leadership. It's going to be technology, it's going to be industry, I think. China has committed to a net zero, which is very important. At the G20, China was clearly behind the one and a half degrees. So I think a lot has been achieved between the G20 and COP, and I think what's really important is to see in the coming years, how quick it's in our hands to make part of this happen in five years, or it could otherwise happen in 15, 20 years. It's about building the project. The capital is there. We saw how many trillions of dollars are already committed. What's missing is really the projects and that's where companies take us step in. Marco Alvera, CEO of SNAM there speaking with our Maria today. Let's turn now to the aviation industry. It's a big contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions, and it's under pressure to change that. In October, the International Air Transport Association, a trade body representing airlines, approved a target of achieving net zero emissions by 2050. We achieved that many airlines in the US and Europe are looking to buy sustainable aviation fuel made from renewable sources like used vegetable oil. Initiatives like these are pushing plane makers to come up with some radical new aircraft that will eventually cater to our growing appetite for travel without hurting the environment. We took a look at how Airbus, the world's number two aircraft manufacturer, is stepping up to the challenge. How long until we can fly emission free? Airbus says it's more confident by the day. It can be done by its 2035 target. Airbus, a CEO, spoke about its ambitions for hydrogen-powered planes at the company's summit in France. The physics works. Hydrogen technologies are not new. They are used in other sectors. We use them in space on our rockets. And we don't need the laws of physics to change to be able to use hydrogen on our planes.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1601,2022-11-21 18:52:08
18988," New, they are used in other sectors. We use them in space on our rockets. And we don't need the laws of physics to change to be able to use hydrogen on our planes. So every day we become more confident. But we think we need to have a plane. We need to have the right fuels, the hydrogen available in the right quantity at the right place, at the right time. And we need the regulations to be ready. So we really need the work and the collaboration of many people on the globe to make it happen on time. But it could be a long way to until green passenger jets go mainstream. Larger aircraft with more than 150 seats are not expected to feature globally until about 2050. That means manufacturers and airlines today are undergrowing pressure to ramp up short-term innovations to cut their carbon. In the long term, meeting the ambitious plans for so-called green hydrogen means building a giant industry almost from scratch. To make that happen, British airline easy jets as among those saying governments need to get involved and fast. Aviation's emissions over the last three decades leading up to the pandemic grew by about 80% to over one gigaton. And that's projected to double by 2050. According to Bloomberg, any F, about half of the airlines with the largest global market share have set net zero targets by that same date nearly three decades away. Coming up from Blue Sky projects to the bottom line, we'll speak with our Bloomberg AnyF expert Meredith Annex and dig into their models about how hydrogen fits into the future energy mix. This is Bloomberg Green. W sense. Excellent! From Bloomberg's World Headquarters in New York, I'm Kaley Lines, and this is Bloomberg Green. Now let's bring in Meredith Annex, our Bloomberg N.E.F. Hydrogen Specialist to talk more about how hydrogen could change the energy landscape. So Meredith, what place do you think hydrogen is likely to have in the future energy mix globally? Hydrogen is this incredible solution for us as we look to decarbonize because it's a perfect solution in areas that are hard to electrify. So we're really like to think about hydrogen playing a role. It's in things like heavy industry, especially where you need a feedstock as well as energy source. And in things like dispatchable power, long-called transport, maybe even shipping and aviation.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1602,2022-11-21 18:56:38
18989," you need a feedstock as well as energy source and in things like dispatchable power, long call transport, maybe even shipping and aviation. That sounds great that it can be used for such diverse industries. At the end of the day, though, how much is this going to cost? Well, that's the amazing thing about hydrogen, because depending on how you make it, it can actually see significant cost to clients in the future. So when we're talking about clean hydrogen, we're usually mean green hydrogen produced from renewable electricity. And in that case, your hydrogen is almost as cheap as the renewables that are used to make it. So if you're in a place with really good renewable resources, you'll be able to have cheaper hydrogen. But even in places with less good resources, we think that hydrogen can be cheaper than a dollar per kilogram, which is the price of unabated hydrogen today, and around $8 per million BTU's for those who prefer to think in energy units. And that can be changed anywhere in the world by 2050, we believe. All right, so let's talk about kind of the pros and cons list. I don't know where cost fits into that. But what are the advantages to hydrogen over other renewables? And then what are the drawbacks? Yeah, main advantage is the fact that hydrogen can serve roles that electrons struggle with. And that's things like seasonal storage, for instance, or just anything where you need store ability, where electrons are harder to store, hydrogen is going to be easier. That also leads to a downside though, because hydrogen is less energy dense than the usual things that we use for storeable energy today, like coal or oil or natural gas. So you will need more volume of storage to handle the same amount of energy. Let's talk about the viability as well and how it may differ in different geographies. What is your view on that? Yeah, so for green hydrogen, again, from renewable electricity, really places with the best renewable resources, things like Latin America or the Middle East, even Southern Europe have really, really good potential for producing hydrogen. And then when you're looking at blue hydrogen, which is produced from natural gas or coal with carbon-caption storage, we do see that becoming more expensive than green hydrogen in the future, especially as renewable electricity costs come down. But that can be a viable option in places like the US Gulf Coast or Russia, where you've got good geological storage for the carbon, as well as ample natural gas that's quite cheap. All right, great breakdown. Thank you so much to our Meredith Annex, our Bloomberg NEF Hydrogen Specialist. And of course, you can get more from the Bloomberg NEF team on the terminal and online. And they've recently done a podcast called Hydrogen 101 as part of its switched on series. So from iron ore titans pivoting to cleaner energy to talk of a hydrogen revolution, that's it from this week's edition of Bloomberg Green. We'll be back next week with a deep dive into the state of electric vehicles. And you can keep the conversation going by following us on YouTube, Instagram and Twitter at climate.

18990," This is Bloomberg Business Week. Inside from the reporters and editors who bring you America's most trusted business magazine, plus global business, finance and tech news, as it happens. Bloomberg Business Week, with Carol Masser and Bloomberg Quick Takes Tim Stenevek on Bloomberg Radio. And live from the Bloomberg Interactive Broker Studio in New York, good afternoon to our worldwide audience on radio, watching us on YouTube and on Bloomberg Quick Takes on Monday, November 21st. Tim Stenevek, in for Carol today, once again is the anchor of ETF IQ on a Bloomberg TV. Also Bloomberg News, senior markets reporter and my co-anchor of crypto IRL on a Bloomberg Quick Takes. Katie Griefeld, how are you? I'm good, how are you doing Tim? Doing pretty well. Happy Monday. Happy Monday. I was going to say that stocks were mixed, but we got the Dow just absolutely straight flat right now. Does anyone pay attention to the Dow Tim? No, they don't. Harsh, rude. All right, we're going to get to the markets in just a second. Volume is down, holiday week. I think that's what's going on. One stock not searching for direction though, Disney shares higher after a shake up at the Magic Kingdom, where you get the latest on the return of Bob Iger, what it means, as well as the abrupt exit of Bob JPEC. What does that mean for, Disney? And the latest on FTX, the news, the tweets they continue, our bankruptcy reporter is on the ground in a Delaware to give us the latest. And in the magazine, we got TechLayoffs sending H1B visa holders scrambling for new jobs. And the big take today, Shines Cotton has been tied to Xinjiang, the region in China that's accused of forced labor. We got a deep dive on that coming up. First up though, let's head on over to Charlie Pellet for a business flat. Shade Charlie. I thank you very much. Happy Monday to you both. We have got the Dow Jones Industrial Average just like that back in the green. Been that kind of a day of volatile session, the Dow being led higher by the Walt Disney company. Disney shares advancing now by 6.1%. Disney off after the entertainment company over the weekend brought back former leader Bob Iger to replace his successor Bob JPEC as CEO of Surprise, capitulation by the Disney board. After a string of disappointing results again, Walt Disney company up by 6.1%. Disney, remember the Dow, the Dow up now by 10 points up by less than 1 tenth of 1%. Little change there. We've got the S&P trading lower down now by 11 to decline there of 3 tenths of 1%. While the Nasdaq Composite Index is down 105 points, a drop there of 9 tenths of 1%. Stocks trim declines after San Francisco Fed President Mary Daley warned that too much tightening could be unnecessarily painful for the economy. S&P being dragged by technology and energy sectors. Nasdaq 100 push lower by declines in Apple, Amazon and Tesla. As for the strength of the consumer and what met that to may mean for the Fed's fight against inflation, Veronica Clark is an economist at city group global markets. We're anecdotally hearing that people are cutting back now but you really haven't seen it in the data yet. And that's really what's going to be most important for us, most important for the Fed is just what are you seeing in the inflation data and then also importantly the labor market data. And we still have really low initial jobless claims. It still seems job openings are high and there's not enough loosening it. And again we do have the S&P down by 3 tenths of 1% now 10-year yield 3.81%. Spot gold down 7 tenths 1738 the ounce, Wild West Texas, Inemidia Crude down 4 tenths of 1% 79 83 a barrel. After the bell we'll be hearing from Dell Zoom video communications and Agilent. I'm Charlie Pelets and that is a Bloomberg business flash. Hey thank you so much for that update Charlie Pelet really do appreciate it. Let's now get to the market draft report. We've got Creti Gupta with us right now. She's Naker and Markets correspondent for Bloomberg. He's with us in the Bloomberg Interactive Broker Studio. Emily Grafello also here, Cross-Sets at reporter for Bloomberg News. It is a full house in the Bloomberg Interactive Broker Studio this afternoon. Creti I want to start with you and just give us your take on what's going on with the trade today because I take a step back and I'm just like okay yeah now's that kind of pressure but",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1604,2022-11-21 19:05:06
18991," You know, this afternoon, Kredia, I want to start with you. And just give us your take on what's going on with the trade today because I take a step back and I'm just like, okay, yeah, Nasdaq under pressure, but volumes are pretty low. Yeah. So let's say there's kind of three angles to this. I'm going to start with the stock market because it's the easiest one. It is low volume day and it probably will be a low volume week as well. No surprise because the holiday, the game changer here is the Disney story. And that's why you're starting to see the Dow. I'm going to say the Dow pop back into the green. All the loud. All the loud. But also look, the S&P 500 was lower anyway because you had a lot of these concerns coming out of China that they were going to turn around and pivot and actually tighten again, given some of those COVID related deaths in their elderly population. Disney has kind of moved it in the other direction, just given the weight that it has not in the S&P 500, but in the Dow and arguably Nasdaq as well. So that would be the one I would keep an eye on. The dollar, I think, is where you're seeing the most action, surging eight tens of 1% to me. It's striking the ripple effect that you were actually see from the dollar. Into the stock market or into the commodity market isn't there today, which tells you this is really a volume story to your point. And lastly, Brent crude, $87 a barrel, this really coming off the idea that on December 4th, that next OPEC meeting, they could be looking to hike. They could be looking to kind of work with the Biden administration. That could be a game. Shout out to your radio talking about OPEC in general. OK. Although there were reports that they would hike by 500,000 barrels, Saudi Arabia specifically has denied it. OK, not the organization. Yeah. You know what's interesting to me, though, is the Fed speak out today. San Francisco Fed president Mary Daly saying that too much tightening could be quote, unnecessarily painful for the economy. I don't know. I read that and then I look at stocks lower. I'm a little bit surprised that that didn't fuel another leg of the pivot trade here. Emily, what is going on? Yeah, it's kind of seems like the market right now is trying to interpret Daly's comments, are they hawkish? Are they dubbish? I had one source say this was pretty par for the course comments from Daly. We know that we're not going to get that Fed pivot anytime soon. You know, we're really looking for a pivot is going to be like a move from restrictive to a commentative and that just doesn't happen if we were to get a pause. Interesting. So differentiating here between a pivot and a pause, what about a step down, though, because I don't know, we have a lot of options ahead of us. It could be 75 or it could be 50. Is that a pivot? I don't think any of my sources are saying that's a pivot. I think they look at the fact that it would still be one of the most aggressive rate hiking cycles that we've seen in decades. So just because we get 50, it doesn't mean that we are getting to, you know, a more accommodative level. So I think people are still nervous about 50 and how that could ripple into the stock market. Could you, what else are you keeping an eye on? That's really challenging because it kind of feels like everything's going to change in that first week of December. And I'm going to bring it right back to the oil team because that OPEC story is ignoring the rest of the week here. Kind of. Really? That's interesting. What about Black Friday? That's what I was wondering. I mean, we're going to get some credit card data, hopefully on Friday and we'll get some Adobe data. They're good with the real time stuff over the weekend. But I think it's kind of, I mean, look, I think it's, I think it's a little priced in the idea here that people are still spending. We already know that from the data, they're relatively two year over year, the holiday season as a whole might be a little bit slower or leaner. We've heard that from FedEx. You've heard that from UPS. We've heard that from the DHL CEO last week as well. Yeah, I'm a song. Right. Like so many people. So I don't think consumer spending is an issue here and it's also something that's not priced into the market. I think the bigger issue is still going to be inflation and it's still going to be this kind of base case of Brent crude heading for 100 except it's not. And I think that's the game changer for the entire market, not just commodities, but for the stock market too. If we get this data on Friday from Adobe and others that shows that I don't know, Black Friday was a blowout. I feel like that's bearish. Am I alone? Like, doesn't it feel like the Fed is trying to crack the consumer? The narrative has been that the consumer is still resilient. You cracked the housing market. You cracked the housing market. It feels like the consumer is still a box of the checks. Are they trying to crack the consumer or are they trying to crack the labor market? Because I think those are two separate dates. I don't think they're trying to crack the labor market. I mean, Powell has said that the unemployment rate is unsustainably low. That's a quote. I mean, if you're trying to control inflation, it feels like you have to.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1605,2022-11-21 19:09:31
18992," I mean, Powell has said that the unemployment rate is unsustainably low. But I mean, if you're trying to control inflation, it feels like you have to crack the consumer at some level. That's fair. And you do. But I think the inflation is coming from, once again, oil, food, housing, specifically. That's where a lot of people are, Americans specifically hold a lot of their wealth assets. And disagree, agree in the fact that yes, but it might happen through different venues, but then disagree in that. I don't think people are saying don't spend, right? Hey, Emily, I want to give you the last word here because we have about a minute left. 40 seconds, I should say. You had a piece out late last week about currency hedge ETFs seeing its largest one day cash trend since 2018. What's the, what's the signal here? Well, the signal could be some traders eyeing a peak in the dollar. That's certainly not what the market is telling us right now. But the currency hedge ETFs have really been a bet on, you know, thinking that the dollar is going to continue to be stronger. If you want to invest in international equities, you want a hedged ETF that will strip out that dollar volatility. So I did, I was monitoring this black rock ETF did see a very large outflow. So perhaps traders anticipating that we've reached peak dollar. They still want that exposure to international equities, but they don't want to hedge against further dollar strength. All right. Emily Grafayo and Crety Goop, thank you so much for joining us this afternoon. First, let's get to World of National News for that. We welcome back Nancy Lyons and our DC Newsroom. Hey, Nancy. Thanks, Tam. As families and loved ones more in the victims in the deadly LGBTQ nightclub shooting this weekend in Colorado Springs, Colorado, investigators are hard at work looking into a possible motive. Police say the suspected shooter had a run in with the law last year and was charged with menacing and kidnapping after allegedly threatening his mother with a bomb. Colorado Springs Mayor John Sothers is praising patrons at the nightclub who subdued the shooter before police arrived. If this had gone on for several minutes more and that heroic action had not been taken, I can only imagine how many more fatalities we might have had. Mayor John Sothers five were killed nearly 30 others injured. Climate negotiators have hammered out a deal to help poor countries face the impact of climate change, but it doesn't do much else. The deal for a loss in damage fund is historic, but details of how the mechanism will work have to be figured out over the next few months and then taken up next year at the COP28 meeting. Negotiators did not secure commitments for more ambitious cuts on greenhouse gas emissions and attempts to have nations agreed a peak global emissions by 2025 or a phase down of all unabated fossil fuels also fell flat. Delegates had to extend negotiations and make last minute concessions to avoid failure. In Washington, I'm Amy Morris, Bloomberg Radio.

Tim Stenefek and Katie Greifeld were live in the Bloomberg Interactive Brokers studio in New York. Katie, among the most red on the Bloomberg terminal this afternoon, it's a story about labor. It's a story about a really important sort of vein when it comes to how consumers in the United States and outside of the US get their stuff. We're talking about members of the nation's two largest railway unions holding conflicting votes on a key labor pact, muddying efforts by the Biden administration to avoid a strike when the labor peace agreement ends just next month. And specifically we're talking about the smart transportation division. That is the largest railway union under the tentative agreement agreement with more than 37,000 members. It narrowly rejected the deal while you had members of the brotherhood of locomotive engineers and trainmen voted to approve it. So quite a split there. Yeah, four unions have now voted down the tentative deal while seven have approved it, though a strike could follow if even one of them walks on the job. Now we should note the results, walks off the job. Excuse me, the results don't necessarily mean that there will be a strike. It does, though, put pressure on union leaders Katie to reach a deal, a better deal before cooling off period expires.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1606,2022-11-21 19:13:47

It does though, but pressure on union leaders Katie to reach a deal, a better deal before cooling off period expires. That's coming up. That's December 9th. December 9th. That's my anniversary, actually. Oh, happy anniversary actually. What does that mean for the real strike, do you think? I don't know. I would imagine the two are tightly linked. I think my anniversary was in October. Well, this is our dating anniversary. Oh. Please keep up. Please keep up. If you had in any case, it wasn't immediately clear whether the Biden administration would step in as it did in September. If you remember that, that's when labor secretary Marty Walsh brokered a deal through an all-night negotiating session at the US Department of Labor Headquarters. I think the control room wants to know about the date of anniversary. So this is the first day you met your husband, Joe? No, this is one Joe specifically said, well, you be my girlfriend because I needed explicit in writing question. Yeah. Did he say it in writing? No, no, he didn't. We're working on that. Maybe this year. How many years will it be? 11. Wow. I know. And five for marriage days of October. Yes. So I'm getting some of the dates, right? Yeah. Okay. Yeah. All right. More to come.

Thanks so much for that update, Charlie Pelot. I don't know about UKD, but last night I about 10 o'clock Eastern time. I saw in my email I had a message, opened it up, all caps headline from the Bloomberg professional service, Bob Eiger coming back to Disney after retiring Bob Chepek out. While was the only word that came to mind, it's some other choice words came to mind as well, but this is a big deal in the world of media. We've got Felix Gillette with us. He's Media Entertainment and Telecom Editor for Bloomberg Business. He's also the author of the great new book. It's called It's Not TV, The Spectacular Rise Revolution and Future of HBO. He joins us via Zoom from New York City. Felix, what was your first reaction when you saw this last night? I was pretty jaw-dropping. I had to close my fantasy football app and pay attention to what's happened in the media world again. Yeah, total shock, surprise, excitement. This is just a totally wild move. And I think underscores what a crazy time it is in the entertainment business and how challenging and tumultuous this transition from the cable era to the streaming era is going to be for pretty much every big player in the space, including Disney. I'll admit, I was asleep at 10 p.m. You had an early morning. Yeah, I was resting up for a big day of reporting for Bloomberg News, but so you described shock. Was anyone expecting this or was this across the board shocking? I think that there were definitely people calling for a change at the top of Disney, particularly coming off of this last quarter, which was really truly a disastrous quarter for Disney. And I think Shaepex performance during the earnings call left a lot of people scratching their head. You know, the Disney had announced this $1.5 billion loss on streaming for the quarter, which was, you know, way bigger than people thought it was going to be. And yet, Shaepex was really cheerful and sunny during that call. So we think in one sense, people were thinking, okay, maybe this guy is in over his head. There's been all these series of missteps. There was, you know,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1608,2022-11-21 19:22:37
18995," All. And so we think in one sense, people were thinking, okay, maybe this guy is in over his head. There's been all these series of missteps. There was, you know, his clumsy handling of the culture war issues down in Florida. There was this, this missile of Peter Rice, the head of television earlier this year, which upset a lot of creative people in Hollywood. Um, you know, so there've been a series of errors. Um, so I think the decision to move on from tray peck, I think is not that shocking. It's really just the bringing Eiger back, um, you know, replacing his hand chosen, you know, pick to succeed him originally, uh, you know, for years every time he's been out in public, people have asked him about would you ever consider coming back to Disney and he said again and again and again, like, no, I'm not interested. I'm not interested. So that part of it is, is pretty wild. Never say never. I mean, I bought back your 71 years old. He's, was at Disney before he, you know, quote unquote, retired, uh, more than for more than four decades. He was its CEO for 15 years. He oversaw some of the biggest acquisitions that the company made, including Marvel, uh, Pixar and other acquisitions. So Felix, what does it mean for the future of Disney and what we can expect over the next two years, which is from what we understand, uh, what we'll see with Eiger. Yeah, I mean, I think the, the argument for bringing him back is this guy had a 15 year run that was seen as this incredible, uh, time for Disney, this great series of acquisitions he made. And, you know, we're at this point in this transition from cable to streaming where everybody is suffering because the linear networks that was making everybody profits are, you know, continuing to decline very quickly. The streaming services are essentially these huge giant holes of money at this point. People are just shoveling money into them. They're still not profitable. Um, so I think it's a time when almost anything, uh, could be up for, um, for sale. Uh, I think we're going to see more consolidation in the space. Uh, people are going to have to team up further in order to survive this era. And I think the argument for bringing Eiger back is you want that guy, uh, making those big decisions over the next couple of years. Um, and, you know, have some faith that he's going to make smart moves. Well, Wall Street is definitely cheering. Uh, both of you look at the shares also, uh, at least one upgrade on this news. But tell us about the potential fly in the ointment here. The activist investor, Nelsen Peltes fund. What could potentially go wrong here? Yeah, I mean, I think that there's plenty that could go wrong. I think, um, you know, part of it is again, the fun, the thing that's kind of funny to me is like, you know, Eiger kept pushing back his retirement again and again during his previous reign. And he kept, you know, there was all this speculation about, you know, who were, who's going to succeed you or do you have a leader in mind? You know, who's going to carry this future, company into the future? He really kept running off potential candidates. Um, and then in the end, he picked this guy, Shadepeck, who left everyone kind of scratching the heads. Why'd you do that? And now, you know, on the one hand, it's great that Eiger's back to deal with whatever acquisitions they're going to have to make in the next couple of years. On the other hand, now he's back in charge of picking another successor for the future of Disney. And it doesn't give you a lot of faith that he is very good at that process. Um, so I think that's going to be part of the challenge that all investors are going to be looking at, like, what is the plan, uh, beyond these two years? Well, that's certainly the question that many people are going to have, but at least as you mentioned, Katie, uh, you pointed to Disney shares up more than 5% right now. And they were high, as high as 9.9% earlier in the day. Felix Gillette, media entertainment telecom editor for Bloomberg Business Week.

This is Bloomberg Business Week. It's Bloomberg Business Week. Tim Steinbeck and Katie Greifeld were live in the Bloomberg interactive broker studios on this Monday afternoon. In just a few minutes, we're going to dive in today's big take. It's all about a huge fast fashion retailer is using cotton that's tied to a Chinese region accused of forced labor. We're going to dig into that in just a few minutes. First up though, Charlie Pellett, we got 90 minutes to go. Less than 90 minutes. Indeed. And we're looking at a mixed day, a mixed Monday with the Dow. Now up by 13 points, been a day of fluctuations for the Dow, swinging between gains and losses. One minute, one minute, one minute, we're down right now. We're up nine points, a little change bottom line there. The S&P on the mind of side down 12 off session lows down 3, 10 to 1% and as you can see, down 113 points lower, thereby 1%. Stocks have trimmed declines after San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly warned too much tightening could be unnecessarily painful for the economy. Right now we have got the S&P down by 3, 10 to 1% with a 10 year yielding 3.81%. The two year 4.54%. Gold down 11, the ounce down 7, 10 to 1%. West Texas, Inevedia crew down 4, 10 to 1%, 79, 73, a barrel shares of the Walt Disney company are up now by 5.7%.

Geitha Reganatham is a media analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. The market loves this, with this surprise, I mean, came out of nowhere. But really, Disney is really undergoing so much of upheaval, especially with that last earnings report. So I think that was what's really kind of blindsided investors and analysts alike when they went ahead and kind of reported those streaming losses, which were double from last year. And basically said that yes, we're expecting to get the profitability, but don't expect it to be a small droid. And again, Disney shares up now by 5.8% crude futures, paired losses.

I'm Charlie Peloton, that is a Bloomberg business flash. Thank you so much for that update, Charlie Peloton. Really do appreciate it. Well, it's time now for today's big take where we bring you reporting from around the world into one big issue. Today's big take is all about the cotton used in shine's clothing. It's been tied to a Chinese region accused of forced labor. The deep dive, the investigation by Sheridan Prasso, senior investigations writer for Bloomberg News, who joins us right now from our 991 studio in Washington, DC. Sheridan, really great to have you with us this afternoon. First of all, I don't think everybody listening is aware of what exactly shine is. Perhaps they're not spending time on TikTok seeing the viral stories about it. But before we get to what you found, explain what shine is. Okay, so she and is the love of a retailer in the world. Oh, I'm sorry. How many times have I seen you go right? You're not on TikTok. Have I totally, okay, this is what I mean. This is why it's so good to have you on Sheridan for so many years. If you were a 13 year old girl, you would totally know all about this company. It's like having excuse. Thank you. It's probably better that you don't know how to pronounce it. Okay, I'm humiliated right now. So she and is the largest online retailer in the world. It's based in China. It has sales of about 24 billion for the entire world. About a third of that, about eight billion dollars is in the United States this year. It sells primarily to young people. My generation's shopped at like Zara and H&M. These days. You and me both, friend. Younger people these days. They are shopping online at Xian. And they took off hugely during the pandemic. And it's still going pretty strong. I have to say I've seen a lot of these haul videos on TikTok. I don't feel great that I actually watch a lot of them too. I don't necessarily just scroll past. But tell us about the investigation part. Because Bloomberg News actually did some laboratory testing. Tell us about that process. So I took a look at Xian because they are based in China. The suspicion about them for a long time has always been that they have to be using cotton that is grown in Xinjiang because 90% of China's cotton comes from that region. It is illegal to import cotton from Xinjiang into the United States as of a regulation that was passed starting last year. And then a law that went into force this year saying that all of the goods from Xinjiang, cotton and everything else is the product of forced labor. And therefore it's banned for importation into the US. The reason it is considered forced labor is because of China's treatment of the weaker people to million people or perhaps more have been put into re-education camps in China. Also they are subject to what the US government calls horrific abuses. What is the loophole that Xian found? So US retailers like Walmart and Gap and others because they send in bulk shipments into the United States, they are stopped at the border. They have to make customs declarations of where their origin is from. And so she and because it doesn't have retail stores in the US, it's shipping directly to consumers in plain white poly envelopes. As long as the amount of goods, the number of goods or the total value of the goods is below $800 US dollars, then they don't have to have any reporting requirements to US customs. They are still subject to the law but they are actually not being inspected in any sort of massive way because 2.7 million such packages come into the US every day using this diminimous trade exemption. So that's how Xian has been able to build up its business into the US and doesn't get its things confiscated by customs. So where does the story go from here? I mean should we be watching for action from the State Department, from Congress for example? So Congress, there has been a move particularly in the House. There was a measure passed as part of the China Compete Act. Earlier this year to require all shipments from China to be have customs disclosures. That measure was not in the Senate version and ultimately when the Bipartisan Innovation Act was passed, they ultimately excluded that provision of tightening shipments required.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1612,2022-11-21 19:39:47
18999," An adversion, and ultimately when the Bipartisan Innovation Act was passed, they ultimately excluded that provision of tightening shipment requirements to U.S. Customs from China. But there were some members of Congress, particularly Earl Blumenauer from Oregon, who are very interested in trying to tighten up this loophole because American retailers are saying we can't compete with forced labor. Before we go, we only have about 30 seconds left, very briefly, what did she and say when you reached out about the results of this test? She and didn't confirm or deny that there are cons from Xinjiang, but they said that they have taken measures to comply with laws everywhere in the world where they operate. All right, it's today's big take. Sheridan Prasso, Senior Investigations writer for Bloomberg News, joining us live from our 991 studio in Washington, DC. Sheridan, thanks so much for taking the time. And her piece, she ends cotton tied to Chinese region accused of forced labor tests linked the retailers apparel to Xinjiang, where U.S. officials say China abuses the weaker population.

Tim Stenevich and Katie Griefeld were live in the Bloomberg Interactive Brokers studio. Katie, did you see this news about Twitter? The latest news? The story is moving so fast. Why don't you tell me? I'm not joking, but it's not a joke because it's not funny to talk about people getting laid off. But to the point of the story moving so quickly, it's like, which round of layoffs are we on at Twitter at this point? This one coming from our own Kurt Wagner Cameron Leach and Maxwell Adler this afternoon at about two o'clock. Elon Musk laying off more Twitter workers from the sales side of the social networks business beginning late on Sunday, further trimming a staff that had already been decimated by cuts and resignations. The context of this is course in the week since he took it over Katie. He's fired thousands of people. Almost 5,000 employees have been lost since Musk's takeover. But some of those employees Katie, he's asked to actually come back. Yeah, which is again, just another interesting wrinkle in this story. So in this latest round of layoffs, as you say, some of those who were fired, they started to receive notice on Sunday that is according to two people familiar with the matter. It's unclear how many will be impacted in this current round though. Twitter sales organization held an all hands meeting on Sunday with Musk and the new head of sales Chris Ritey. Two people said many employees showed up expecting some announcement about cuts after Bloomberg reported Saturday that more were coming. Instead Musk used the time to talk about ongoing updates, including his decision to reinstate the account.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1613,2022-11-21 19:44:08
19000," said many employees showed up expecting some announcement about cuts after Bloomberg reported Saturday that more were coming. Instead, Musk used the time to talk about ongoing updates, including his decision to reinstate the account of former US President Donald Trump. One of the people said he also explained that the company needed to make ads more targeted to particular users, according to another person familiar with the remarks. There was no mention of layoffs during the meeting. What changes have you noticed to Twitter since he took it over? Absolutely not. Really? Yeah, what have you noticed? Just to me, are so poorly targeted. I just, I don't even, yeah, my eyes are for influencers, they're for like people who are trying to gain more followers. Are they for she in? No, that's funny. They're not. They're actually for nothing. I don't want to say legitimate, but it's like, it's mostly people trying to get more followers. I feel like I don't even get ads on Twitter. Well, you're doing it, right? I guess. Yeah. I check out this story and more available on the Bloomberg terminal.

Among the names scheduled to report after the close of trading today, we'll be hearing from Zell, Adele, Zoom video communications, and Agilent All 3 are lower. I'm Charlie Pellet and that is a Bloomberg Business Flash. Thank you so much for that update, Charlie Pellet. Really do appreciate it. Well, we've talked in the past about what it means for people who've been laid off from some of the biggest tech firms. I mean, we're talking about companies like Meta Platforms, Uber, Lyft, Salesforce, Stripe, and more. And we talk about it oftentimes in the context of what it means in the bigger picture of what it says about the economy. But there's a different way of looking at it that's really important and it has to do with people who hold H1B visas. And what they're doing, if they've been laid off, we've got Sendoja, Ragnar Ajan, on the phone with us. She's Senior Investigative Data Reporter. Actually, she joins us via Zoom from San Francisco for a Bloomberg News. You can read her story right now on the Bloomberg terminal and at bloomberg.com slash business week. Also with us is Joel Weber, the editor of Bloomberg Business Week. He's with us right now in the Bloomberg Interactive Brokers studio. So Joel, how should we be thinking about these layoffs? Well, one thing that really struck me with Sendoja's reporting and company's reporting is about H1B visas. And H1B visas have been something that the magazine has written about before. Skilled workers that have largely been in the tech industry from abroad. And we're talking some pretty incredible stories about where a lot of these people come from. But the tech industry has really benefited from this workforce. But what's interesting is that effectively, it's a company sponsored. So the moment that any of these people get laid off or fired, it puts them in a really difficult place. A lot of these people end up with mortgages, child care, all kinds of stuff because they're banking on a future here. Oftentimes putting permanent residency in motion at the same time. So Sendoja, bring us inside this, having seen this data, how significant of a hit to the tech industry are these firings having as it puts a lot of these people in jeopardy? Joel, this is a very interesting question. So it's like hundreds of employees we know have been laid off just from Twitter and Meta, I think, around 350. And I want to say it's an under account because we're looking at people who have been posting on LinkedIn, putting their name out there in a crowd source spreadsheet or something saying, hey, I'm in need of a visa sponsorship. Overall, when we did our analysis, we realized just with six companies that have been recently doing layoffs, Meta, Twitter, Amazon, Stripe, Salesforce, and nil remember what we saw? Um, and um,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1615,2022-11-21 19:52:50
19002," is we realize just with like six companies, you know, that have been recently doing layoffs, meta, Twitter, Amazon, Stripe, Salesforce, and Lyft, we found that they just, the six of them employ 65,000 H1B workers. That's an estimate we look, we created based on our data analysis. And just between Twitter and meta, we found hundreds of people who claim to be visa holders, who have been laid off in the last few weeks. So it's a pretty significant number, you know, and it's in the hundreds for sure. As you and our colleagues, Brody Ford and Katrina Matson, right, people who do hold H1B visas, who then become unemployed, they can only remain in the US legally for 60 days without finding new employers to sponsor them. Do we know anything about the terms that these employees are given when they are laid off from companies because they face this special circumstance, like are they given better terms because they're on this kind of timeline here? Yeah, I mean, I think, you know, that was the interesting thing we found while reporting the story. You know, we started out thinking of the story as like a human story, you know, what happens when you have this few weeks, few months of deadline and you're trying to scramble for another job and a visa sponsorship. But what we realized is that some companies are doing better than others in terms of how they treat their immigrant workforce and what policies they lay out. For example, you know, we found that Twitter sort of didn't give a lot of assistance or support to these employees and some other companies have like a little well-thought, slightly better thought out policies. So for example, you know, you 60 day clock start sticking after the last day that you've, you know, worked there. So if you could extend that last day, you know, if there's like a notice period given that you're going to be laid off, but after two months, so that gives like people four months, you know, two months when they're working at that company and then an additional 60 days. So if that can be a form of relief, and as opposed to saying, you know, you're laid off today, and then, you know, we're going to give you severance for three weeks or whatever or eight weeks of something and then, you know, your clock starts right now. So that extension of time is really important. And you know, some companies, I think Mehta has done that particularly for immigrant visa holders. Lyft was another one. Stripe when they wrote that email, I don't know if they offered a notice period, but they, you know, definitely acknowledged that this would be very difficult for immigrant visa holders. And Twitter, you know, sort of they didn't think through as much based on our reporting. I noticed. Yeah. And there was, you know, and when employees wrote to them, they many of them were really confused about, you know, when does my clock start ticking? Does it start the day of January 4th when, you know, you've said that that would be our last day, but, you know, we're not productive, we're not on the, are we on payroll? Are we not? And, you know, like is it going to be November 4th? And so there was like a lot of confusion amongst employees, and they got very little guidance, very little like immigration, one-on-one counseling, or even, or even, you know, anything that says more definitely, yeah, this is the day you need to, this is your last day, or that is your last day, they just said, you know, you should consult your own immigration attorney. So I think, you know, employees, that's like the least you could do for this workforce, if invested so much time in this country, like you mentioned, and, you know, at least give them like the most they can get so they can like succeed in finding that job, especially now at the start of a place when a lot of tech companies are instituting, hiring freezes and holiday season when things slow down. So, you know, the more you can do for them, the better it is for them. Okay, so we, I want to talk a little bit more about the Indians, because there, there are a ton of H1B, Avisa holders from India, many of them, as we, you write in the story, have been here for years, and it seems like it's really hitting that country hard, hard these numbers, right? So, who, who did you talk to, and what did you learn from on the India question? I think, you know, a lot of people who come on H1B visas, like you mentioned your role, like the goal is to eventually, you know, get permanent residency and citizenship, and for a lot of folks like, you know, you stay on H1B for anywhere from three to six years, your company starts working on your green card application, they file it, and then",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1616,2022-11-21 19:57:05
19003," And for a lot of folks like, you know, you stay on H1B for anywhere from three to six years, your company starts working on your green card application, they file it, and then you get your green card in, you know, I want to say anywhere between one year to three years or something of that sort, but with Indians and actually Chinese nationals, like you file that green card and there's like a huge backlog because there's this rule that says that, you know, you can know every country is allowed to get only 7% of the green cards and Indians and Chinese being a huge part of the tech force have, you know, immigrated on this visa and larger numbers. So, you know, particularly for Indians, you know, there are 7% of the green cards reserved for them every year, which accounts to around 10,000 green cards, and then there are 500,000, nearly 500,000, you know, holders who applied for the green card so that, so only 10,000 will keep getting every year, and that backlog is huge and it's growing. So, you know, if you apply for your green card today, or if you applied for it in 2020, then the, the, the, the, that it's not a good take as long as, you may not get it in the late, we unfortunately have to leave it there, Sendoza, Ron Nourage, and senior investigative data reported for Bloomberg News via Zoom from San Francisco. Come down to the close. Bloomberg's comprehensive cross-platform coverage ahead of the US market closed starts right now. This is the countdown to the close. About 60 minutes ago in the trading session, a holiday short and a week on this Monday afternoon, Romain Bostic alongside Scarlet Food, joined right now by our colleagues, Tim Senevich, as well as Katie Greifield, Carol Maser, taking a well-deserved day off. We welcome our audience.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1617,2022-11-21 20:01:55
19004," We've gotten this Monday afternoon, Roman Bostic alongside Scarlet Food, joined right now by our colleagues, Tim Stenevich as well as Katie Greifield, Carol Maser, taking a well-deserved day off. We welcome our audiences across Bloomberg, television, radio, as well as on YouTube, and Quick Take Tim. A weird day here in the markets. I don't know if you can make too much of this. I mean, basically Stasis, something that we've seen now for the last six or seven sessions. Yeah, Fed, you know, one Fed speaker today and people digesting comments still from last week and tech under pressure. But, you know, volumes are so low right now. It's kind of hard to, you know, take too much away from what's going on. I'm not seeing a lot of conviction. One place I am seeing underperformance, though, and shout out to Carol because she's not here today. We got a look at Chinese stocks that are listed here in the United States, ADRs of those Chinese companies. Under pressure today, down 3.8%, this is the Nasdaq golden drag in China index. It is all about concerns due to progress or lack thereof that we're seeing when it comes to China reopening. We could see more setbacks following reports of more COVID-related deaths in Beijing, entire restrictions. And when I say COVID-related deaths, I mean, we're talking the number you can count on one hand. The country, in the entire country, saw its first documented virus related deaths since May 26th over the weekend. And we saw two more in Beijing on Sunday. So less than 10. Oh, I mean, we got three in the last year. Yeah, hold on, hold on. That's what we know of. That's what's been disclosed. That's a very good point, Scarlet. It's a good point. Okay, so still interesting to see quite the movement in HXC. I wanna talk about Bitcoin though. I'm dying to talk about Bitcoin. It's down below $16,000 coin. That is significant just because it seemed like that $16,000 level was really holding amid all of the drama that we've seen over the past two weeks or so. But Bitcoin, it's only down 3%, but again, below that kind of key level. All right, well, we go back to the broader markets here with all the major indices and averages lower here on the day of the Dow. Basically unchanged on the day, but the S&P down about 4%, 10% of the percent. And you're taking a look at the NASDAQ composite right now. That's your big laggard here on the day. Down about 1% here on the day is a lot of those big cap tech socks like Apple Tesla, Amazon, lower here on the day, Scarlet. Yeah, a lot of drama in the crypto world, but not so much in equities. If you break down the S&P 500 into 11 industry groups, even with the S&P down 4%, 10% of 1%, you have more gainers in terms of industry groups than decliners. Consumer staples leading the way, specifically food, and beverage names, and household products names, that really tells you people gravitating towards safe plays, basically safe haven type companies. And that's why you also see utilities up, not very much, but up 3, 10% of 1%. Energy continues to be a laggard here. That was the case at the end of last week. Of course, we did have oil prices fall as much as 6% earlier today before climbing back some of those losses. Yeah, that was a pretty dramatic move that we saw there, another dramatic move that we're seeing, at least on a single stock basis, is Tesla. Tesla shares down about 6% right now. In fact, over the last two months, basically since mid September, those shares are down more than 40% here. It's not quite clear at this as anything to do fundamentally with Tesla itself. There's a lot of concerns here. Of course, about a potential slowdown in the EV market. A lot of concerns, though, more about Elon Musk and whether he's being stretched a little bit too thin with his acquisition of Twitter, as well as some of the other things that he has. What is it about? Twitter CEO is how they always have their eye on something else. They're always running another company. Yeah. Talking like Jack Dorsey when he went to swear and block. Well, there you go. Well, we're going to find out, a lot of demand destruction. There, if you're a Twitter shareholder, you have to be a little bit perturbed here, particularly for a stock that was trading above 400 bucks, just wet, I don't know, a year or so ago. So-fi technology is also moving lower down about 6%. This one the back we're learning that the Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee are looking to investigate the cryptocurrency trading activities over at So-Fi. And two of the bright spots on the day, guys, Disney shares up 6%. And to keep an eye on Becht in Dickson, this is sort of a niche play here, but up about 5% here on the day. This is on the back of a court ruling. They appear to have solved it and some of its peers on some cancer lawsuit regarding its plants here. Meanwhile, I was taking a look at investor sentiment, guys. And I know that Scarlett and Katie, you guys are all over what's been going on in ETFs. And it looks like that the sentiment is still relatively bullish here, despite the fact that this market has been trading sideways. The inflows that we're seeing into some of the big ETFs, this chart that you're looking at right now, combines the QQQs and the S-PY and spy. And you can see that inflows have been pretty significant, pretty substantial here, basically five for the last six weeks. Hey, Romaine, I want to go back to one of the things.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1618,2022-11-21 20:05:53
19005," s-a-p-y and spy and you can see that inflows have been pretty significant, pretty substantial here basically five of the last six weeks. Hey, Romaine, I want to go back to one of the single stocks that you chose to pick out on your board of movers today. Disney, I mean if we think about single stocks and stories today, that's certainly among the biggest. I certainly let out some sort of surprise last night at 10 when I heard that Bob Eiger was coming back to replace Bob Chapeck after being gone just for a few years. You were just sitting on your Bloomberg terminal at 10 p.m. I was checking, I looked, I saw that I had a message on my phone and checked it and I was like, wow, this is huge, this is absolutely huge news. Jason Bazinet over at City was on Bloomberg markets earlier today. He's got a $145 price target on the stock and our colleague Alex Steele asked him about how much more he likes the stock now that Bob Eiger is back. Check out what he has had to say. There's nothing about Disney streaming business. There won't be as valuable as Netflix. The problem is for Disney and a lot of other companies, the street is just unwilling to accept losses in this current regime. That's fine, but I just think that the logical implication of that is to say Disney streaming business, which does over 20 billion of revenue is worth nothing is a bit extreme to me. That's Jason Bazinet over at City. He's bullish on the stock again, $145 price target straight just shy of a hundred bucks. The streaming business, he says there's opportunity there and he says the street is discounting businesses like this that are losing money right now. Look at Netflix. Okay, but Scarlett, what's different now with Bob Eiger at the helm than when Cheapick was at the helm 24 hours ago? What is Eiger going to do that Cheapick couldn't? He knows how to talk to directors. He knows how to talk to talent. I mean, when you guys were talking about Bob Cheap, Bob Eiger, I was just thinking of the Bob's in office space. How the Bob's, Katie knows I'm talking about. I actually haven't seen office space. This is somehow the second time it's been brought. You've seen the meme. You know the meme. I have seen the meme. Yeah, that's true. Here's what I'll say, Romain. We had Felix Gillette on earlier who covers this for Bloomberg Business Week and he said that we could see more consolidation in the space. I mean, look at the big acquisitions that he's been good over his tenure. He might sell things. He might sell things as well. So like what? Pixar? No, Lucas Films. I mean, those are pretty powerful. Marvelians that I don't see being more powerful is basically keeping this entire industry afloat right now. And I mean, and I guess my question to in all seriousness, this was a guy I'm talking about Bob Eiger. And you did a lot of great things in terms of operationally, but a lot of his success really was through acquisitions. And I wonder, is there an appetite for that among investors to do those types of big acquisitions? We don't see him like we used to. We certainly don't seem like we saw over the last couple of years, especially in a high rate environment. We'll have to see investors certainly liking it, though today, although shares down from being up more than 10, a little over a close to 10% a little earlier, that is going to do it for our cross-platform coverage right now. We'll be back again live on TV, radio, YouTube, and Quick Take it 4 p.m. for Beyond the Bell coverage when we take you through today's market close. This is Bloomberg Business Week with Carol Maser and Bloomberg Quick Take's Tim Stenevig on Bloomberg Radio. It's Bloomberg Business Week Tim Stenevig and Katie Griefeld, who's relived in the Bloomberg Interactive Broker Studio. Why does everyone think it's so kind of wild-cated that I was looking at my phone at 10 o'clock last night? I don't know. I think this is... Should I go to bed earlier? Yeah, maybe. What time do you usually go to bed? Oh, two-month too late. That's the truth. I don't know. I like to be asleep by 10 p.m. So I can wake up at six. Goals, hashtag Goals. Yeah, first year. I mean, what do you think of, based on what Felix told us earlier about what's going on with Disney? I mean, I think Romaine makes a good point pushing back at the idea that one executive coming in and and being at the helm of this company can change the environment that we're in right now. And I think that's one thing that investors are struggling with because if you look at peers to Disney, right? Paramount, for example, or Warner Bros. Discovery, Netflix, and I'm using the term peer very loosely here. Yes. They've been under pressure. They have an under pressure. I think Felix made a great point. I mean, Iger, he's pulled back in. He's only supposed to be there for two years. He's charged again with finding another successor. Like Felix said, I don't know. He didn't go so great the first time around. Right. We'll see how this one plays out. And will he only truly be there for two years? He's 71 years old. Right. And one of the guys he was supposedly set to choose to be successor before Chapec was chosen, wasn't chosen, who then left to run TikTok for a very short period of time. I mean, his name wasn't Bob, so that was probably the problem. That's a good point. Yeah.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1619,2022-11-21 20:10:11
19006," I mean, his name wasn't Bob, so that was probably the problem. I think the other part of this too is I just think it's so fascinating to look at what Igers comments have been over the last few months. Did you listen? Yeah, I listened to clips of it and he was basically like, there's no way I'm coming back. No, no, no. You know, people say things. Also, he's 71. He wrote the book already. He's 71, but God bless. We'll see what he does. Yeah. All right. We'll check out more coverage of everything around Bob Igers return to Disney after being away for a few years from members at the company for more than four decades. You're listening to Bloomberg Business Week and this is Bloomberg Radio. Let's get to world in national news. Nancy Lyons, standing by NDC. Hey, Nancy. Thanks, Tim. Well, today is the first day on the job for newly appointed special counsel who's taking over two investigations of former President Trump. Former FBI director, Andrew McCabe tells Bloomberg he doubts that attorney general Merrick Garland would have appointed Jack Smith unless there were some legal concerns. I'm sure they spent a lot of time thinking about this decision. They've looked at it from every possible angle. They wouldn't have taken a step like this if they thought that the case against Donald Trump was not proceeding. That's not to say that everything will end in indictments because we're certainly not there quite yet. Andrew McCabe tells Bloomberg the Mar-a-Lago case alleging that Trump took classified documents is likely the first case that will be addressed. Continuing a Thanksgiving tradition, President Biden today, pardon two turkeys from North Carolina, named Chocolate and Chip. And later today, the president, first lady, are sharing a Thanksgiving meal with service members and their families at Marie-Core Air Station Cherry Point in North Carolina. The Friends Giving Dinner is part of the White House's Joining Forces initiative. The world's biggest sporting event is underway and cuttered. Touch fan Andy Stoff says so far, the atmosphere at the World Cup is great. From the minute we arrived in the airport, there's a way to get up and stare. We thought it would be a bit more like, we would love some security and issues. But now I think they did a great job in making everybody feel really welcome. The team USA is playing its first match right now against Wales and Group B. The US leads one nothing earlier today, England, defeated Iran, the Netherlands beat Senegal. Global news, 24 hours a day on air and on Bloomberg, quick take, powered by more than 2700 journalists and analysts in more than 120 countries. Nancy Lyons, thank you so much for that update. Really do appreciate it. It's Tim Stadevek and Katie Griefeld in for Carol Maser this afternoon, we're live in the Bloomberg Interactive Brokers studio. You can watch us on Bloomberg Quick Take, Bloomberg.com slash QT and of course on YouTube as well, just search Bloomberg Global News. Katie, we got a couple of stories here about both about things that you've been following very closely. I want to start talking about Kathy Wood. She's going on a buying spree or has been on a buying spree when it comes to one stock in particular, coin base that you followed closely that has been getting hit pretty hardly. It has been getting hit pretty hard, just absolutely caught up with this crypto draw drown that we're seeing. Even though coin base, it's not FTX. I don't get this. I guess I get it a little bit, but I'm going to give you the devil's out. Tell me what you're struggling with. I'm struggling with the idea that if you remove one of the biggest exchanges on the planet, then ostensibly that would be good for an exchange that is regulated and audited that is publicly created based in the US. And I'm talking about coin base here. But it would be bad for coin base. If nobody buys their sales bit coin? Yeah, it's true. It's truly an existential moment for the crypto industry. You have retail completely soured on the idea of using a platform like coin base. That's retail. That's just the normal people. And then you think about people who are true, hardcore, Bitcoin believers. They're not using coin base. They're buying and putting it into cold storage. They don't trust these hot wallets on exchanges. They want this offline. Okay. Let's speak about buying and selling Bitcoin. If you want to do it in an ETF, GBTC, it's a great skills trust. It's actually not an ETF. Oh gosh. And that's so important. It would love to be an ETF. But because it's not an ETF, it can't redeem shares. It's trading at an enormous discount as a result.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1620,2022-11-21 20:14:27

Bill Maloney into here live breaking news over your Bloomberg type SQUA on your Bloomberg terminal. I'm Charlie Palette and that is a Bloomberg business flash. Thank you so much for that update, Charlie Palette. Really do appreciate it. Well, House and Senate panels are planning hearings in December about bankrupt crypto exchange FTX and its former CEO, Sam Bakeman-Ferre, to mid-renews calls for Congress to strengthen regulation and oversight for the industry. Also FTX and related companies now in bankruptcy collectively have had a carryover federal net operating loss of at least $3.7 billion. That's as of December 31st last year, based on tax returns according to court filings. All this to say, Katie the news about FTX continues to come. We've got Stephen Church back with us. Bankruptcy reporter for Bloomberg News. He joins us via Zoom from our Wilmington Bureau. I, Stephen, before we get to what's happening tomorrow, what's happening later this week, because even though it's a holiday week, we are still seeing expectancy, quite a bit of activity when it comes to bankruptcy court. What is the latest that you're following? Bring us up to speed. I'm just preparing for tomorrow's hearing, which will include some big questions that people are waiting to answer. People have been waiting for a while. It amidst all the firehose of news, it's been coming out. We still don't know where all the money is and what's going to happen, how they're going to track down that money. Hopefully tomorrow, the first thing lawyers will do, will give an update to the judge about their efforts to get hold of assets. So that's what I'm looking for tomorrow. Let's go back into the firehose of news, because one of the things that caught my eye over the weekend, is this currently on hot news, but our argument is that it's on emergency, in a minute, the issues are being announced, I understand it's political, I'm going to make your decisions. People are waiting for something that's in there, that's the different aspect of real estate, where others are looking at a case you don't know. There's been a time when the most of the fund,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1621,2022-11-21 20:22:03
19008," get hold of assets. So that's what I'm looking for tomorrow. Let's go back into the fire hose of news because one of the things that caught my eye over the weekend, other than the Disney news. I know you're watching that Tim. What I was paying attention to was this headline, FTX owes its 50 biggest unsecured creditors more than $3 billion. Sounds like a lot of money. Oh my gosh, doesn't it for only 50 people? I don't know, Steven, help me out. Well, it's a good question about who these people are. Yeah. Company won't tell us. They specifically say that they're customers, which means that they could be people who simply had money on the system. And because their customers, FTX is arguing that it would be a, it would be in not in their interest, it would be bad for the company to publicly release those names. That's hopefully will be a fight tomorrow. Hopefully the US trustee will argue in the public interest that those people should be named. But the top few, I mean, the top 10, each have more than $100 million in claims against FTX. Those are unsecured claims. And they're all named as customers without their names. Well, that's what I've been wondering. The fact that this list was redacted is that standard practice or is that unusual? That is highly unusual. For a list of unsecured creditors is normally a public thing. They may redact, say, personal information. Sposure have an individual who's not really involved in the company who's a big creditor. They may take out that person's social security number, their home address. But for a blanket, 50 person list with no names and no identifying and information whatsoever, I've never seen it before. The fig leaf that the company is trying to argue again is they're really customers and therefore they should be protected because if they release the customer's names, rivals will poach those customers and then that will be bad for FTX in the long run. But as you said, this argument really hasn't been made before. Does it seem like it's going to hold up in court? It might. The argument has been made in limited circumstances, but never in such a broad way. We'll see what the judge decides to do about that particular issue. Eventually, some names will probably come dripping out because as the court fight continues, creditors will organize themselves and then they'll put their own motions forward during the case. So we'll start to see some names at some point. But in the early days, it's right now. So it's an odd black box. Steve, and you mentioned that you are, by the way, black boxes came up, keep coming up over and over again. It's just a story. Yeah, with regard to FTX. Hey, you said you're doing a lot of preparation for tomorrow when FTX is set to be in court. There's going to argue that all US insolvency cases related to the downfall of the crypto empire should be handled at Wilmington, Delaware, not split between federal judges in Delaware and in New York. What's the significance of this? I mean, obviously it is personal significance for you because you're based in Delaware. But how should we be reading into this as people who are following it? Well, actually, there was some interesting news on that today. The regulator for the Bahamas agreed that the case that they filed in New York should be moved and consolidated down here in Delaware. What that tells me is that the regulators in the Bahamas are not going to have a big logistical and procedural fight over who should control the case and the future of the case. It looks like the normal process where you have international regulators and US regulators working together in some kind of cooperative fashion, even if they may not have completely agreed, it looks like that's beginning to take hold. So that's one problem perhaps that FTX creditors might be able to breathe a sigh of relief on. It looks like there won't be a turf war after all. Well, that's, I have the same question for you again, but related to this situation, you can probably tell I'm not too often covering bankruptcy's. How unusual is it to see a turf war over which court should actually control the case here? It's odd. It's not unheard of. Sometimes international, sometimes the big international companies have different interests in different places. There was a company called Nortel many years ago that filed for bankruptcy. They filed in the UK, they filed in France, they filed in Canada and of course they filed in the US. And there were battles there over who could get paid first.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1622,2022-11-21 20:25:53

In the meantime though, Charlie Pellett, we got less than a half hour to go. Indeed Tim, looking at a down day for the S&P, the Dow and Nezdaq all in the red right now. Been a choppy day for the Dow, but right now lower by one tenth of one percent down 30 points. The S&P is down 15 drop. There are four tenths of one percent Nezdaq down now by 115 points down by one percent. Stocks lower across the board as investors sit through comments from San Francisco Fed President Mary Daley, who's warning that too much tightening could be quote unnecessarily painful for the economy, also mounting concerns that China made tighten COVID curbs after a string of reported deaths is weighing on investors as well.

As for the market backdrop, Katie Kaminsky is chief research strategist at Alpha Simplex Group. You've seen more positive signals and equities especially around the CPI print. You're also seeing a little bit more reversion out of the dollar trade, but that's still there. So that's why it's kind of said it's a balance between what do we see shorter term and longer term. And the longer term signals are still definitely saying that there's some things to worry about ahead, especially the curve, the yield curve being inverted recently.

And right now we've got Carvana shares plunging 12.7%. The online car dealer is corining toward a record low as investors grow more concerned about the continuing decline in used vehicle prices.

We want to welcome in once again, Shaheen Contractor. People who listen to the program are familiar with her voice. She's ESG analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence. She's with us once again in the Bloomberg Interactive Broker Studio. Fresh off of her recent trip to the Conference of Parties 27, that's COP27 as it's known. Shaheen, good to have you with us this afternoon. You just got back from Charmel Shake, Egypt, Resort Town. I know you did a lot of working there and not resorting, okay? Maybe some resorting, maybe some vacation. I hope you had some fun. First of all, what was COP like? I know this was your first one. So Tim, COP was like nothing I've seen before. COP was the two-week conference where 40,000 people just descend to talk about climate. I don't think I've ever been in that kind of environment. It's very focused. There were so many interesting discussions, so many different things, especially around two things in particular. The first was really carbon markets. There were people who were great supporters, there were people who were great disbelievers. The second one was around companies, carbon reduction goes, and the need to just go beyond just pay for decobinization, I guess. Tell us about that debate there on carbon. What is sort of the rallying cry for the advocates and what are the non-believers saying? So when it comes to carbon markets, the goal is for companies to basically offset their own emissions by purchasing these credits from projects that remove carbon from the atmosphere. And basically the goal there has to be that sort of the price of carbon, the cost of carbon has to pay for that additionality, sort of without that the project might not have been viable, which makes it sort of an additionality. The people who are against it believe that a lot of this money is going to go towards projects that are already financially viable, it's like a renewable project where it's cost competitive, it's going to be built anyway, there's no additionality, so the money is really going to. Nothing, I guess. So it's basically the point that you have to fund a project through offsets, which otherwise wouldn't have existed. Okay, well you cover ESG for Bloomberg Intelligence and a big part of your trip, of course, had to do with the way that you're writing reports about what you learn there and what investors can learn from the way that ESG is being talked about at events like this. What's a big takeaway that you have for the Bloomberg Intelligence audience? So the one thing is, and I've said this before, but before God this year, before God last year, companies are setting these carbon reduction goals at a pace we've never seen before, there were quite a few interesting talks that happened around actually sort of implementation. Like the UK for example, had this new proposal during COP where you know, for company has a goal, they have to have a plan on how to meet that goal. I think that's the biggest takeaway, even in our research, we find that out of the companies we've looked at about 85% have carbon goals, but what do these actually mean? It's a huge gap. Yeah, I mean, this is something I always think about. How do you factor in goals such as that one when you're thinking about a company's ESG score? Yeah, so that's really interesting because when carbon is material like for sectors like utilities, really sort of environmentally heavy sectors, that's when actually having a goal could have some kind of financial impacts. I think it comes down to materiality. What are the sectors where carbon matters and how does it actually factor into your financial performance? I want to talk bigger picture COP because you were there and I haven't gotten to speak to many folks who were there. Does it, do you leave with the impression that it's useful to the extent that all of these countries are...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1625,2022-11-21 20:38:53
19012," And I haven't gotten to speak to many folks who were there. Does it, do you leave with the impression that it's useful to the extent that all of these countries are going to leave and go back and work to reduce carbon emissions? So we ultimately see a reduction in climate change. So Tim, I'll be honest. Before I went to this, I was really skeptic. I was like, why, what is the point of gathering? That would be swine in on the private jet. So that's the thing. But then I spoke to a negotiator there. And he told me one thing. He said, you know, shine, think back to 2015. No country had a net zero goal. Had anything related to do with sort of climate ambition. But look at where we are today. About 130 plus companies have net zero goals. So year to year is kind of frustrating. But over the big picture, we have achieved something, I guess, compared to businesses, usually if you think about it. So I feel better now. We're talking about it. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Are you optimistic? Are you going next year? I hope so. I don't know. Are you optimistic, though, just in the last 30 seconds that we have? I am. I think given what companies are doing, given what countries are saying, given some of the things we've seen, I think I definitely am. Well, welcome back.

Officials are gathering evidence at the scene of a crash at an Apple store in Him, Massachusetts, not far from Boston. Nearly 20 people were injured. One person killed. Tim Cruz is the Plymouth County District Attorney. It appears at the outset, preliminary. The dark color SUV appears went through at a rate of speed undetermined through a plate of glass window and struck multiple people. And then, the dark color SUV says the SUV caused injury to victims both outside and inside the store. He declined to release the name of the driver, who is male or the victims. He also did not say whether the driver would be charged with a crime, but added a criminal investigation is underway. Well, the man suspected of opening fire at a gay nightclub in Colorado Springs over the weekend is being held on murder and hate crimes charges. That information surfaced in online court records today, two days after the attack that killed five and wounded many others.

19013," out there. Wow, that transitions neatly into what we're going to be talking about. There's all of these different return to office trackers. Bloomberg news did a really helpful roundup. It's interesting to see the type of data that they analyze to come up with their numbers. Castle systems, I don't know, I read about them a lot. We talk about it a lot. It's probably the best known return to office tracker. It provides building access swipe cards to employees at over 2600 office buildings. In 138 cities, it logs their movements in and out every day. It knows where you are. Yeah. Well, in October of 2020, Castle started aggregating swipe card data and making it anonymous. What they did from buildings across 10 of their largest markets, they called it the back to work barometer and they began publishing it weekly. Castle says as the largest continued data set following return to office activity and a big advantage is that it's based on what people actually do. Here to the data, though, Castle shows that New York occupancy served nearly 10 percentage points after labor day when many bosses set forth new RTO mandates, yet has stagnated. Since then, it's did at 47.2% for the week ending November 9th, just below the national average of 47.5%. And Castle is dominant. It's not the only one, though. There's Placer.ai. It's relatively the new kid on the return to office block. It's an Israeli startup. This one is interesting. It's supplied valuable foot traffic information and analytics on retailers like Walmart and Target. Now it is also trying to track again, these employees. What are they doing? Are they in the office? Why are they working when they're in the office? Are they working when they're at home? Check out this story. It's by Matthew Boyle. He does a lot of a return to office work here at Bloomberg.

19014," Music Markets, headlines and breaking news, 24 hours a day. From Bloomberg World HENQWaters, I'm Charlie. How about 13 minutes ago, ahead of the closing bell, the Dow, the S&P NASDAQ, all in the Red right now, stocks are declining with Fed hikes and China in focus, mounting concerns that China may tighten COVID curbs after a string of reported deaths continuing to weigh on investors. The S&P now down by 4, 10 to 1 percent down 15, the Dow is down 44, decline there of 1, 10 to 1 percent while NASDAQ is lower by 113 points for the NASDAQ that is a drop right now of 1 percent. The NASDAQ 100 index also down by 1 percent, 10 year yield, 3.82 percent with a 2 year yielding 4.55 percent, spot goal down $12 the ounce to 1738 West Texas, and immediate crude below $80 a barrel right now 79, 73 down 4, 10 to 1 percent. Down day on Wall Street, I'm Charlie Pellet, that is a Bloomberg business flash. Thank you so much for that update, Charlie Pellet. It's 348 on Wall Street. The following is an editorial from Bloomberg Opinion. This editorial was written by the Bloomberg editorial board. UK Chancellor Jeremy Hunts' first budget had to pass one test above all. It had to convince investors that the Tories' new leaders know what they're doing. Hunt took no chances. He announced significant tax increases in spending cuts that, in due course, should be enough to get public borrowing back under control. The bad news is that the forecast attached to the new measures is dire. Britain's independent fiscal watchdog predicts a recession lasting more than a year. Household disposable income, adjusted for inflation, will stay below pre-pandemic levels through 2027. Give Hunt credit for facing reality, but there's no disguising the gravity of this setback. To salvage his economy, the UK must do more to promote skills, investment, and trade. Avoiding another fiscal meltdown is only a start. This editorial was written by the Bloomberg editorial board.

So help us understand the way that you're viewing the markets right now.

19015," Well, thanks. It's good to have you back with us. So help us understand the way that you're viewing the markets right now. We're getting to the close of the year, sort of the final sprint to the end of the year. It's a holiday week. We're seeing volumes down, what, 23% right now versus the last 20 days on the S&P 500. How does the year end? You know, that one's a bit of a toss up to be quite honest with you because we have tax loss selling. You know, at the end of the year, but we also have prices coming down to what I consider to be much more attractive than we've seen in in a number of years. And so, you know, it's anybody's guess on the timing and when people do their tax loss selling, but we've certainly already done all that stuff. And now we're trying to pick a way that some of the opportunities that tax loss selling is going to is giving us. So can I write off the rest of the year then and trying to. You don't even have to come in Katie. Okay, that's what I'm trying to get to. I have been hearing more about tax loss harvesting in what a brutal year, but I want to bring you into a debate. We were having at the start of the program about the consumer because we're going to get a lot of black data or a black Friday data on Friday after Thanksgiving. We know that the consumer is still strong here. When you see headlines and economic reports to that effect, what is your takeaway? Is that bullish or bearish for you when you think about what the Fed is trying to accomplish? Well, I mean, listen, the Fed is a whole different story that we could probably spend a lot of time on, but from a consumer, you know, when we are starting to feel squeezed, we start to make different decisions. We start to play the this versus that game. What do I need to buy even if I don't love the prices that are higher? What do I have to buy? I got to keep doing that. What can I defer maybe for now? If I'm feeling the pinch a little bit, particularly towards holidays, you want to have good holiday spending. So I think we're in that period of consumers just making a decision about what to spend on and where to go and which brands are the most relevant. I mean, that's where we spend all of our time on brand relevancy. So we feel like that we have a good expertise in that area, but clearly the consumers, you know, feel in the pinch a little bit with prices being up literally across every category that we see. Okay, so that's the perfect segue to talk about what you're concerned with and that's an earnings recession. Did we, I mean, given what we've heard about from companies that have reported already and we still got Zoom after the bell, but we're pretty much done with earnings season. Q4 is not going to look great for a lot of companies. Amazon, for example, already gave us a heads up about that target as well. What did you see and what does that portend for Q1 2023? Well, I think the thesis is the next shoot a drop is earnings will start to reflect all the things that the Fed has done and that slow down will be here. My problem is, you know, the valuations have been reset so much already. Who knows if it's a full reset or a two thirds reset, whatever the number is. I suspect we have an earnings trough for the year, you know, probably reported in the April quarter and historically markets bottom three to six months before earnings and GDP, etc. And so, you know, if we're in late November now, where, you know, the market probably has fully discounted or at least, you know, almost fully discounted the earnings recession that I think everybody expects. So does that mean we've hit bottom? Well, I don't know that we've hit bottom that that's above my pay grade. I'm trying to find the right price points for the brands that we love. It's really hard. I think, you know, Michael Semblis from JP Morgan put out a report. I think that 3,300, 3,400 on the S&P is a reasonable place to go. It doesn't mean we have to go there. It doesn't, we stay there. But I think if we get to that level, you're going to see some, you know, multi year wonderful buying opportunities and sentiment is probably going to be dreadful if we get down there. But that's usually when the best buying opportunities happen when it feels bad. All right, Erica, I want to get specific here. I want to talk about the brands, the names that you're excited about. What are you looking at? Well, I mean, we focus on a lot of trends. And so some of them are consumer trends. And that's not just buying and selling of goods and.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1629,2022-11-21 20:56:18
19016," What are you looking at? Well, I mean, we focus on a lot of trends. And so some of them are consumer trends. And that's not just buying and selling of goods and services. You know, I love we love this mega trend in alternative assets. People migrating a little bit of money from stocks and bonds into alternatives, regal assets, infrastructure, private equity, all those things. Blackstone and KKR are the two biggest. They are fairly cheap now. The stocks have come off pretty meaningfully this year. I'm looking for really good snapbacks in in 2023. Within regular consumer spending, you know, I still like the the athlete's year, the Lulu lemons and the Nike's they come down pretty meaningfully. We still like the home. I know there's, you know, home sales have have cooled off pretty dramatically with the Fed actions and mortgage rates rising. That just means that people are going to stay in their homes rather than move. And so I'm not surprised to see Home Depot and lows still doing pretty well. You know, inventories are up a little bit. What pricing hours is really strong Eric Tesla is on your list as well. Thanks to the notes that you sent our producer Paul a little earlier today. I'm I've got Teslas one of my decline or state down to what another close to 6% 6 and a half percent right now down more than 26% from when Elon's deal for Twitter clothes. Why are you bullish on Tesla? Well, we we sold it much higher ago and we just started nibbling literally put a pinky toe in the water a little bit higher than where we are and and we'll start to it's the smallest position in the fund. I just you know right now the distractions that Elon has had with this Twitter. I think are providing long term opportunities. And so I'm going to be very slow and methodical to put money into Tesla as it declines. But anything under I think 150 you know one between that 125 150 level. I think are pretty good places to add to that name from the long term. But it's been it's a teeny tiny portfolio position right this minute. That this is really interesting that the Tesla discussion the Elon Musk discussion. I mean we hear all the time as a bear case for Tesla that you know this is Elon Musk is a distracted CEO. Obviously he spread very thin with the most recent Twitter fiasco. How much of a concern is that for you? You say this is a long term sort of nibbling that you're doing. But how do you factor that concern in? Well I think that he is getting the message. But let's use Disney as a good example. You know Bob Chepack probably wasn't the right guy Bob Iger is coming back. Elon said he hates managing day to day business. That's not for strength. He needs a Tim Cook type operator to run Tesla. And he probably needs one to run Twitter. Let him be the kind of the cheap chief information or innovation officer. Right. That's really he's just doing too much. And I think he finally realizes he. Eric we got to run unfortunately we got to get you back Eric Clark portfolio manager at rational dynamic brands fun. Soon because our countdown to the close and beyond the bell starting up in just a minute. Beyond the bell Bloomberg's comprehensive cross platform coverage of the US market closed. Darn right now. And right now we are two minutes away from the end of the trading day. Romain Bostic here alongside Scarlett food. We're counting down to the closing bell and here to help take us beyond the bell. It's our global simulcaster joined right now by Tim Stenevich Katie Gryfield in. For Carol Maser today we welcome our audiences across Bloomberg television radio as well as on YouTube. And quick take here interesting day in the markets Tim where I think the market kind of looking for direction here. Not quite sure they're going to find it here on a week like this. Yeah the only thing that I'm seeing is that is tech really underperforming today. And we're going to get to that in just a few minutes. We did just have a really interesting conversation with Eric Clark portfolio manager at rational dynamic brands fun. He joined us on our program. And he said that he wasn't really ready to call a bottom but he does think that the market is probably fully discounted the earnings recession that we've all expected. The earnings recession caused by raising rates. And at the same time he caveated that with we could still see you know 3300 to 3400 on the S&P 500 which would represent a significant decline from where we are right now Katie. He also said he's nibbling on Tesla but that's another conversation. What I find remarkable when I look at today's action.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1630,2022-11-21 21:00:38
19017," Ponder rich would represent a significant decline from where we are right now, Katie. He also said he's nibbling on Tesla, but that's another conversation. What I find remarkable when I look at today's action, 10 year treasure yields just completely unchanged. Less than one basis point higher, really captures at least my mood music. It's a holiday week. You know, when I look at the industry groups, it's actually showing that you have more advances than decline or seven groups in the green, whereas only four are in the red. But the one that caught my attention was energy stocks down one and a half percent on the day. This is, of course, on concern that perhaps China is not going to pivot away from COVID-0. You have some news out of there that there are some deaths from COVID. There's also a rise in infections. Everyone thinks that nothing's going to change over the winter, but certainly as you get towards 2023, if you are looking for some kind of growth. A four day work week here in the United States because of the Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday, and we should point out Friday markets will close early. So most of the price action, most of the volume, you're going to get at the beginning of this week, you put it all together, you get a Dow Jones industrial average lower on the day, by about a tenth of a percent. The S&P 500 lower by four tenths of a percent in the NASAC composite down by about 1 percent. Meanwhile, the Russell 2000 really couldn't get out of the way down about six tenths of a percent. If you're looking for any bright spots, believe it or not, Dow transports close higher on the day in the green. That's largely on the back of a lot of those trucking companies rallying. Well, really speaking to the larger companies dragging on the S&P today, we actually had more companies move higher in the S&P 271 advance versus 232. But what are the right companies to them? Well, the big market cap companies like Tesla, Amazon and Apple that really weighed on the index. So bringing it down. Scarlet. Okay, and of course, I mentioned earlier, we had 11 industry groups and energy was leading the way down. I want to take a deeper look into what's going on here. Katie, you mentioned Tesla. That is definitely a factor here driving the S&P 500 auto and components index off by 5.4 percent. All five members in that index are down, led by Tesla. And of course, energy down there as well, off by 1.4 percent oil prices at one point, tumbled as much as 6 percent. But of course, then Saudi Arabia came out and denied reports that it is moving forward with any kind of production increase at next one's OPEC plus meeting. A lot of time between now and then of course, so there could be a lot more headline risk to be aware of. And on the upside, food, beverage and tobacco companies up by 1.5 percent, there is that safety play once again in force and real estate up by 7.10 of 1 percent. Insurance and utilities also hired by about half of 1 percent, Katie. I'm going to talk about the story that we all know from my first gainer. We're talking about Disney. One Bob out, there's another Bob in Chapec replaced by Iger. Remain, I know you have thoughts here about whether that move makes sense, but Wall Street seems site. I mean, shares finished up over 6 percent. That gain was closer to 10 percent earlier, but still a big day for Disney. Let's also talk about Roth's stores because had its biggest rally in two years on Friday, that's after reporting results, they were better than expected. They also boosted the full year profit forecast. That rally is carrying through to today shares up 4.4 percent or so. I want to end on dominoes. I mean, like Scarlet walked us through, it's a good day for the defensive sort of sectors there. Dominoes, the only piece of news I could find for today's action. Right. They did invest in an EV fleet. They're going to roll out nationwide 800 Chevy Bold EVs. I don't know if that's why the shares are up 2.7 percent, but that's a little bit fun. I like that. I'll take it. You got the gainers, Katie, I got the decliners. Let's talk about Apple. I mentioned these companies, big tech, mega-cap tech, weighing on the S&P 500 at Apple, finishing down more than 2 percent. Scarlet, you alluded to the challenges that China is facing when it comes to potentially reopening and seeing more COVID cases, at least reported in recent days. That could be one of the reasons why we're seeing Apple underperform the NASDAQ 100 and S&P 500 today. Also, at the bottom of the S&P 500 on a points and percentage basis, Tesla down 6.8 percent today. It's down more than 26 percent from less than a month ago, October 28th from when Elon's deal for Twitter closed. Then, draft kings, finishing them down by more than 5 percent. Biggest one-day drop since November 9th. The company moving lower after some customers reported that their accounts were compromised and money was withdrawn. The company did say that...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1631,2022-11-21 21:05:02
19018," that their accounts were compromised and money was withdrawn. The company did say that it had less than $300,000 of customer funds that were affected, and it intends to make whole any customer that was impacted. Yeah, I'm going to point out that Tesla fresh show 52-week low. In fact, a new low going back to 2020, new lows for coin bases. Well, you turn and look at what happened in the yield space. You were talking about this a little bit earlier. Only modest moves to be sure here, up about two bases points on your two-year yield down, about two or three bases points on the other parts of the curve. You put it together though. You actually end up with deeper inversion here. Right now, your two's tens are somewhere around, negative 73, 74 here. Remember, last week, we were talking about a two-tens curve that was at the deepest, the steepest that we've seen in the negative going back to 1982. As of today, the lowest that we've seen going back to 1981. I suppose that moves towards what Goldman Sachs Riders were looking for, which is lower valuations reflecting recession, of a peak in interest rates. I mean, if you have a more deeply inverted yield curve, does that mean more of recession than it signaled on Friday? I remember when the curve first inverted a couple months ago, everyone told me, hold your horses. It's the depth of the inversion that matters. It's the length of the... Did they really say hold your horses? Are you? It's an expression. Katie's partial to horses. I didn't even realize that I did that. Yeah. It was just so natural, very organic the way it came out. But now we're looking at it deeply inverted yield curve. It's been hanging around for a while. I feel like at this point, no one is really denying that signal anymore. Now it's just... I mean, where's the floor here? How deep could this go? Yeah. And I think too. We've been talking about a lot of folks looking at sort of where that longer ended. The curve goes relative to where the FIT's funds rate is. And that'll... I think it'll give you a better sense here of how we shake out with regards to recession predictions here. I mean, while we are getting some earnings guys, Zoom video crossing the wire right now, there are three Q numbers coming in on an adjusted basis, the EPS at $1.7. And that appears to be a beat. The street was looking for 83 cents a share. And the revenue numbers coming in at about $1.1 billion, which is pretty much on the nose of what the street was looking for. Here's your forecast, Scarlett. 4Q revenue, 1.1 to 1.11 billion, slightly less than the street estimate of a dollar... Excuse me, 1.1, 12 billion. And then for the full year on EPS 391 to 394 a share, that's kind of in the range of what the street was looking for as well. And this is something we'll talk about with John Butler of Bloomberg Intelligence a little bit later on. But the big issue for Zoom here is whether small businesses are willing to pay up for subscriptions. The enterprise market, because we know that consumers have Zoom accounts, but as long as we get off at what, 59 minutes, no one has to be... Yeah, no one has to be the premium. No one's paying the premium. And think about the growth story in the stock. You're talking about a stock course during the pandemic was up. I mean, excuse me, the revenue growth was something like a 120 percent. Astronomical. Now we're down into the single digit percentage range for this growth story. So not necessarily a growth story. It's a utility. Yeah, and that's really how the company has shifted the conversation as we've moved to this next phase of the pandemic, moving away from the idea that this is a tool that's meant for bringing people together who aren't coming into the office and more one of hybrid work. Here's what the company's CEO and founder, Eric Yuan said in a statement, quote, our customers are increasingly looking to Zoom to help them enable flexible work environments and empower authentic connections and collaboration. And they're working to proactively address these needs with expanding platform continues for Zoom in this environment. No one's, it's not like anyone's stop using Zoom. It's just that they haven't really monetized it in the way that people thought they should. Is that the, is that the story? That's part of the story. And I also think, you know, what happens if you start to see some of these startups that aren't necessarily, you know, growing at the rate that they were growing at before we started the most recent regime of interest rate hikes, right? If we see, look at how much money has been raised for startups this year versus last year, we're not seeing the small companies in medium-sized businesses grow to the same extent that they were growing at over the last couple of years. Who else needs a Zoom account that hasn't gotten one already? That's my question. What's the total addressable market you are? Yeah, yeah, what about horses? Is there a market there Katie? That's true. I don't know if they can perceive screens, you know, and I mean, they're... I know horses were smart. They're actually incredibly smart and intuitive animals. That's true. That's good. They just, I want to get a learn how to sort of put the hoof on the mute buttons. The whole thumbs conversation, it's really challenging. All right. We got to run, guys, before this gets to you out of hand that is going to do it for our cross-platform coverage of the market clothes right here on Bloomberg TV. As you said earlier, she's taken a well-deserved day off. A reminder from today.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1632,2022-11-21 21:09:27
19019," This gets to you out of hand that is going to do it for our cross platform coverage of the market close right here on Bloomberg TV. As you said earlier, she's taken a well-deserved day off. A reminder from today, I have to say that quick take is now summon casting on Bloomberg Business Week. You can do that at bloomberg.com slash Qt. This is Bloomberg. You're listening to Bloomberg Business Week with Carol Masser and Bloomberg Quick Takes Tim Stenevich on Bloomberg Radio. It's Bloomberg Business Week, Tim Stenevich and Katie Griefeld who are live in the Bloomberg Interactive Brokers Studio. Remain lost me at the end a little bit. What were you guys talking about? We were talking about horses and mother they could perceive screens and even if they could, I mean, what they have hooves, Tim, they don't have thumbs. How could they work it? We work with horses in the real world. Yeah. You know, we're not doing this over Zoom. Yeah, no. Again, very intuitive, just sort of emotionally intelligent animals. Okay, what are your thoughts on today versus the rest of the year and how we should read into a trade like today? Should we not really be good at today? I'll say if we can put any stock in a day like today when you have volume falling off a cliff, I hear Thanksgiving is on Thursday. You're right. It's just, it's difficult. It is and then Friday is a short and trading day. So I'm not here. Very few people will be here. You won't be here. I will not be here. I'll be on vacation, taking a little break. Are you going to say well deserved? No, I wasn't. It's not well deserved. All right. In the meantime, let's get to world of national news. We got Nancy Ryan standing by in our 991 newsroom in Washington, DC. Hey, there, Nancy. Thanks, Tim. Well, transportation officials are letting air travelers know what they can bring on board planes this Thanksgiving. If you can spill it, spread it, pump or pour it, then put that on him in your checked bag. That includes canned fruits and vegetables. You can, however, bring baked goods and meat onto the plane in your carry on. Triple A says this Thanksgiving air travel is up nearly 8%. Well, President Biden is following tradition and today presided over the annual feel good White House event, pardoning two specially selected groomed and trained turkeys before the holiday. The president joked that in an outdoor ceremony in 40 degree cold, he wouldn't gobble up too much time. Well, votes are in. There's been counted verified. There's no ballot stuff in. There's no foul play. There are big turkeys, aren't they? My fellow Americans, please welcome in 2022. National Thanksgiving turkeys, chocolate and chip. The two turkeys will live out their lives on the campus of North Carolina State University as the president and first lady had to cherry point North Carolina for pre Thanksgiving dinner with military families in Washington, Earth, Campman, and Blueburg, radio. One person is dead at least 16 hurt after an SUV smashed into an Apple store in Massachusetts. Doctors say the injuries include head trauma, even some mangled limbs.

Katie, the billionaire owner of Nine West is eyeing NYC Casino bid in a reshaped empire. We got Stefan Soloviev, who owns Nine West 57th Street, pitching a casino complex with a Ferris Wheel and Democracy Museum here in Manhattan. You know, the American Dream. No, but the American Dream Mall, well, for New Jersey, has a Ferris Wheel. It does. And there was supposed to be years ago, a Ferris Wheel built at the tip of Staten Island. So you could actually see the views of Manhattan. That makes a lot of sense. Would you go to Staten Island to ride that Ferris Wheel? Yeah, I've gone to Staten Island just to ride the ferry. So really? Oh, yeah. I've gone to Staten Island. When you have a toddler, you do stuff like that. Like you go ride on big boats and ships. It does sound cold. We did it in the summer. Yeah, that makes more sense. Tell me more about the story, Tim. OK, so, Stefan Silvia, has been an apartment landlord.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1633,2022-11-21 21:13:48
19020," Hold. Um, we did it in the summer. Yeah, that makes more sense. Yeah. Tell me more about the story, Tim. Okay. So, uh, Stefan, Sylvia, there's been an apartment landlord, farmer and a railroad operator with an empire stretching from the unforgiving croplands of the American West to the gladiatorial arenas of global finance. This, according to our own Patrick Clark. Now he wants to add gaming mogul to his disney resume. He intends to apply for a licensed operator casino just south of the UN here in New York. So not too far from where we are on a massive site that's been lying fallow since his father, the late Sheldon solo agreed to acquire it more than 20 years ago. The current plan includes a thousand room hotel, four acre, uh, 1.6 Hechtaker Park Ferris wheel and museum dedicated to the subject of democracy. It would be a good place for Ferris wheel because you get great views of Queens. Yeah. Yeah. That makes sense. I wonder if this will fly. I mean, I think about, um, New Jersey, New Jersey. Obviously can't have Casinos outside of Atlantic City, which kind of leaves if you're someone who lives in Manhattan. It's not like you can pop over to New Jersey for Casino. There's, there's, did you see the picture in this? The rendering of the Freedom Plaza project. Yeah, check this out. It's on Bloomberg dot com.

I'm Charlie Pelleau Dell that is a Bloomberg business flash. Thank you so much for that update Charlie Pelleau. It really do appreciate it. Well here at Bloomberg Business Week we follow the what's happening in the car industry when it comes to electrification very closely. It's not just one company anymore. Test love of course. There is pretty much every company from established automakers to upstarts that are going after what many see as the next market for really drivers. We got Daniel Weisland with us, Audi of America, form Audi of America. He joins us via Zoom from Herndon, Virginia. Daniel it's good to have you with us. How are you? Hey Tim it's great to have you. Yeah it's good to have you with us. Hey tell us before we get to details about what's going on specifically with your position at Audi of America. I just want you to talk a little bit about the environment that you see out there right now because you're in these high level meetings where you're talking about the American consumer and what the American consumer can spend money on right now and how to price these cars. What's the economy from your advantage? Let me start first that we at Audi were fully committed to an electric future and obviously leading the way and also over the last three years we have learned how to manage COVID, we have learned how to manage supply challenges and we also manage economical challenges. And as we can see as for Audi right now we see a high demand actually our demand is highest in the supply and especially for electric vehicles so consumers want to buy more and more electric vehicles. Well that's what I want to dig into this sort of shift to EVs. What I was going to ask is with the inflation that we've seen throughout the economy, hottest inflation in a generation, do you think that that has it all slowed this timeline down when you think about the average American driver adopting EVs? Well actually I think it's accelerating the way towards electrification. That's what we see at Audi over the last few months with the introduction of the Q4 e-tron and the Audi Q4 e-tron spotback. Now we have the largest portfolio of any automaker here in the industry and the last ones we had a 70% increase with our battery electric vehicles last quarter it was 50%. So again we continue to see more and more consumers wanted to go into electrification and that's something where we are well prepared. We're going to invest also going for 19 billion euros over the next few years to make sure that there is a car electric car for every consumer out there. Hey Daniel, what is the internal data tell you about your portion of vehicles that you sell will be EVs by the year 2030 because according to Bloomberg, NEF, only just over half of passenger cars sold in the US will be EVs and that's by the year 2030.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1635,2022-11-21 21:22:26
19022," EVs by the year 2030 because according to Bloomberg, NEF, only just over half of passenger cars sold in the US will be EVs. And that's by the year 2030. And I don't know about you, but that seems kind of slow to me. Yeah, I expect that it's going to happen the most much faster, especially in premium segment. For Audi, I predict already in the next five years the tipping point that we sell more battery electric vehicles and internal combustion vehicles. And by 2030, the most majority will be battery electric vehicles. Why do you say battery electric? Is that just semantics? No, that's what the current technology provides you. This is the most advanced technology that comes to zero emissions. Yeah, there might be new technologies coming maybe after 2030, but for the time being, this is a technology which is the most developed, and that's what we see. So let's talk about the supply chain here. It's something that we have been talking about for years on Bloomberg, specifically when it comes to chips and what that has meant for automakers. But from your vantage point, I mean, where are we in the supply chain story? Has peak supply chain already passed for your business? I think going forward, we still see some challenges in the whole supply chain around the globe. But I think we also managed to adapt according to our customer needs and expectations. So for example, now we're trying to pre-sell cars before they even arrive the country here. And that helped us obviously to fulfill the demand of certain extent. And we managed this way also that certain challenges if the car is not in the country. Yeah, we can still sell it even if it's outside of the country. What are you seeing as an entry point for people when it comes to EVs? You said that premium end of the segment. And Audi is certainly a premium brand. But what do you see as the entry point in terms of dollars? Where, how low could you go in terms of price? So we started in 2019 with our Audi E-Tron price point around $80,000. Then last year we brought in the Audi E-Tron GT as electric car to the market. Yes, price point above 100,000. And now we have a Q4 E-Tron and a Q4 E-Tron sport weight. We brought down the entry price level below $50,000. And that's one thing that it's a retail price. But you also need to look at the costs of owning the car. And with electric vehicles, it's a lot less than it is with internal combustion engine vehicles. You know, the gas prices wherever you live have increased throughout the last few years. And with electric cars, obviously, it's a lot cheaper to maintain and run those cars. That's a concern, though, to a lot of dealerships that make money by maintaining people's internal combustion engines and vehicles. What are the conversations that you guys are having with dealerships right now about how they need to be prepared for a future that's electric? Our dealers are an essential part of our strategy and of our future. And we're discussing with our dealers constantly how we increase and improve our business. So actually, it's welcome with the battery-electric vehicles because they're very loyal to those customers. They're not going to any different garage to fix the car. And we should not forget, we have so many non-electric vehicles on the road which they can maintain and make profit from. So we're not concerned about the future with Audi. Actually, we're excited about the future because our business is going to grow. Well, let's talk about the future. We only have 30 seconds left. It's almost 2023. What are your priorities heading into the new year? Our priorities is breaking. Our future's electric as we say it, Audi. And we have a key responsibility towards a sustainable planet for our children and our generations to come. Dan Weisland is president of Audi of America. He joins us via Zoom from Herndon, Virginia. Daniel, really appreciate you taking the time and joining us on Bloomberg Business Week this afternoon. Taking a look at how markets close, the Dow ended up finishing the day lower by a little over 1 1 1% the S&P 500, down 4 1% of 1% the NASDAQ, the drag on markets today, was certainly big tech. We saw that play out on both the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ, the NASDAQ, finishing the day down by a little over 1%.

Bloomberg 1130 to Washington DC, Bloomberg 991 to Boston, Bloomberg 1061 to San Francisco, Bloomberg 960 to the country, Syria's XM, Channel 119 and around the globe, the Bloomberg Business App and Bloomberg Radio.com. This is Bloomberg Business Week. It's Bloomberg Business Week, Tim Stenevek and Katie Greifeld live in the Bloomberg Interactive Brokers Studio. In just a few minutes, we're going to really round out our program today with a new book out. It's called Mow & Markets, the Communist Roots of Chinese Enterprise. We got one of the authors joining us this afternoon in just a few minutes. But first, let's get on over to Charlie Pellet because Charlie, we got some news in the after hours. Indeed, lots of earnings. Let us begin with Dell technologies that reported quarterly sales that beat analyst estimates, signaling that demand for technology infrastructure does remain strong, even as computer sales have sharply declined. After ours, Dell, up now by about 5.6 percent, also reporting after the bell, Zoom video, it reported adjusted EPS for the third quarter that beat the average analyst estimate. But after ours, we have got to Zoom, trading lower by roughly 4 percent. And one more company that reported moments ago, Agilent, it is up now by 4.5 percent. Stocks fell today as investors continue to parse comments from Fed officials who broadly reiterated their resolve to remain persistent in their fight against inflation. The S&P today fell by 15 points to drop there of 4.10 to 1 percent. The Dow down 45 at a climb of 1.10 to 1 percent, as it tacked down 121 to drop there of 1.1 percent. 10-year yield, 3.83 percent. The 2-year 4.55 percent, spot goal down, 7.10 to 1 percent, 17.39 yards, while West Texas, Inimedia Crew was down 4.10 to 1 percent, 79.73 a barrel. Well, as for the market outlook, Eric Clark is portfolio manager at Rational Dynamic Brands Fund, and he was our guest right here on Bloomberg Business Week. I think that 3,300, 3,400 on the S&P is a reasonable place to go. It doesn't mean we have to go there. It doesn't mean we stay there, but I think if we get to that level, you're going to see some multi-year wonderful buying opportunities, and sentiment is probably going to be dreadful if we get down there, but that's usually when the best buying opportunities happen when it feels bad. And right now we've got the S&P at 39.49 down today by 4.10 to 1 percent. 10-year-yield 3.83 percent, spot goal down, 7.10, 17.39 yards, West Texas, Inimedia Crew down 4.10, 79.73 a barrel.

19025," for that update, Charlie Pellet. Well, when we've been talking about China over the program this afternoon, a lot of it has been focused on China reopening and the slow process that it's had and what COVID-0 has done to the country's economy. And in fact, we've spent the last couple of years really focused on that. Our next guest, though, argues we have to go back even further to really understand business in China today. We've got Christopher Markwiss with us today. He's the author of Mao and Markets, the Communist Roots of Chinese Enterprise. He wrote the book along with Kun Yuan Chao. He joined us via Zoom from the Pittsburgh area. Christopher, Professor, it's good to have you with us. How are you? Great. Thanks. Great to be with you. Well, take us into what we're missing in the discussion that we have about China and the economy today. Why do we have to go back to Mao to understand what we're seeing when it comes to the incredible growth that we've seen in China over the last four decades? Yeah. I mean, I think you're spot on amazing, incredible growth. I mean, really, the last 40 years in China has been maybe an unprecedented economic miracle without a doubt. But people are really surprised at how hard line Xi Jinping is. You just mentioned the COVID situation, just how absolutely locked down and inflexible the system has been. And I think that is a hint as to why it's important to go back in history because Xi Jinping is really not a surprise if you look at the foundational ideas and principles that were put in place by Mao. And what we argue in the book is that these last 40 years, the West has focused on some of the opening policies. And this has been very much in line with how we think the world should be. As China opens its doors economically, that then, of course, they would become more democratic, more liberal. But actually, as we've seen, that's not the case. And so to really understand the foundational sort of hard line communist principles that Xi is currently implementing, you have to go back and look and see what Mao did. I want to talk more about the similarities or sort of the parallels that you see between Mao and Xi Jinping, because he's sort of, I mean, in this most latest reshuffling, feels like he's pretty close to total control in China. Of course, he stacked his leadership ranks with loyalists. Tell us a little bit more about what you see there. Sure. And of course, comparing leaders across eras, I mean, you have to take it a little bit with the grain of salt. But I mean, they're obviously different people, different eras, so, but I do think, if you look at the core ideology and principles of Mao, you can actually learn a little bit about how Xi Jinping thinks. So some of the key areas and items are this idea of the party at the center and the party controlling everything. We talk about China like it's a nation state like the US or European country. But actually, the government is not in charge of China. Actually, the Communist Party of China sits on top of the government. So this, I think, was really underplayed a bit over the past 40 years, and it's come back to the fore. So Xi has a number of sort of sayings that he repeats that Mao had said. One of them is something like East, West, North, South, center, the CCP leads everything. So I think that is one thing that we really have to come to grips with that actually, it is an authoritarian regime that does not have the rule of law and can do abduct foreigners from other countries and various other things that are really against the liberal principles that we base our base governance and interaction in the West. Another thing that's in some ways, corollary to that is the importance of nationalism and sort of make China great again, so to speak. I think this is something Mao talked about, China standing up, sort of becoming a great nation in the world. I think that...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1639,2022-11-21 21:39:42
19026," Again, so to speak, I think this is something, you know, Mao talked about, you know, China standing up, you know, sort of becoming a great nation in the world. I think that discussion also, you know, subsided a bit as China was trying to grow economically and she definitely has that back at the fore. Hey, Chris, for Stick With Us, Professor Mark Whist, Professor of Chinese Management at the University of Cambridge, also the author of the new book Mao in Markets, the Communist Roots of Chinese Enterprise. We're going to do some news and then we're going to come back and continue our conversation. Katie, when we do come back, one thing that I want to talk about is the role of American companies and multinational companies in China. And to what extent they need to understand the historical roots of Chinese Enterprise today in order to successfully operate there. Because as the professor was just explaining, you know, there are many values that don't necessarily align with a lot of the values of many companies from the liberal democracies, yet those companies want access to those customers. Absolutely. And vice versa, when you think about Chinese companies trying to do business abroad and China may be cracking down there. All right, we're going to get to that in just a few minutes. In the meantime, World of National News, we go to Nancy Lyons in our 991 Newsroom. Hey, Nets. Thanks, Tim. Consumers could see higher gas prices and shortages of some of their favorite groceries during the winter holiday season. That's if railroads and all of their unions cannot agree on new contracts by an early December deadline that has already been pushed back. The largest of the 12 rail unions, which represents mostly conductors, rejected management's latest offer that included 24% pay raises. Brad Edelman is a labor attorney with the brotherhood of maintenance of way employees. He says it all comes down to health benefits. They have been so phenomenally profitable over recent years. It's hard to even calculate. And this is this is a drop in the bucket on that. And it's way past time for them to do that after their workers work straight through the pandemic. Edelman says the railroads would see improved service if they treated their workers properly. Well, five days after launching from the Kennedy Space Center, NASA's Orion spacecraft reached the moon today. NASA Sandra Jones says the spacecraft set a record as it traveled behind the moon. It's about 40,000 miles past the moon in its orbit. This is actually 30,000 miles farther than the previous record set during Apollo 13. And will be the farthest in space any spacecraft built for humans will have ever flown. Orion will stay in that orbit for about six days before firing its engine and coming back home.

After some customers reported their accounts were compromised and money was withdrawn. Yes, so the company believes that customers' login information was compromised on other websites, then used to access their Draft Kings account sets according to the company's co-founder, who also said that Draft Kings has seen no evidence that its systems were breached to obtain the information. We have identified less than 300,000 of customer funds that were affected and we intend to make any customer that was impacted. I want to go back to the statement that the company said it believes customers' login information was compromised on other websites and then used to access their Draft Kings account. What this means is that companies were using, come to customers, excuse me, were using the same passwords and login information across, well, I can't imagine because that's sort of the basics of why password managers are what security people who follow this stuff closely, that's what they recommend when I ask them, hey, what recommendations do you have for us to keep safe online? Like the first thing that they always say to me is use a password manager because then you can use a randomly generated password.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1640,2022-11-21 21:44:03
19027," They recommend when I ask them, hey, what recommendations do you have for us to keep safe online? Like the first thing that they always say to me is use a password manager because then you can use a randomly generated password that is unique to that website. You know, and I never do that. I was hoping you wouldn't say that. Do you do that? Yeah, I do, yeah, I do. Wow. Because I've been covering this stuff for years. And I've been using password managers for years. And that's what security consultants say. I always use the same base word and then a different number. You shouldn't talk about this on air because then people are going to like know how to hack you. Just rooting for chaos here. But yeah, that's the concern. Yeah. And in any case, this comes at a not great time for draft kings. Earlier this month, it reported that user growth had slowed in the third quarter. That caused it to share a supply. By the most in treating history, so more bad news. OK, use unique passwords, folks. And also two factor authentication as well. So you get a text when you enter that log and info.

19028,"מ Let's go. Markets, headlines and breaking news 24 hours a day at Bloomberg.com, the Bloomberg business app and at Bloomberg Quick Take. This is a Bloomberg Business Flash. From Bloomberg World, Hank Waters, I'm Charlie Pellet. We begin with the developing story and a headline from the Bloomberg professional service sources tell Bloomberg, digital asset brokerage, Genesis is struggling to raise fresh cash for its lending unit and it is warning potential investors that it may need to file for bankruptcy if its efforts fail. Earnings after the value include Dell technologies that reported quarterly results of beat estimates shares after ours up by just about 5% also reporting after the bell. Zoom video communications it reported adjusted EPS for the third quarter. The beat the average estimate that after our zoom is down by roughly 4%. A down day for the Dow, the S&P and NASDAQ Fed speak certainly weighing on investor sentiment. S&P down 15 dropped there of 4 tenths of 1% the Dow today down 45, a drop of 1 tenth of 1% NASDAQ to day down 121 points down by 1.1%. 10 year yield 3.83% the two year yielding 4.55% spot gold down 7 tenths of 1% 1738 the ounce while West Texas and the accrued down 4 tenths of 1% 79 73 a barrel. Bitcoin now down 4% 15,591 on Bitcoin. I'm Charlie Pellet and that is a Bloomberg business flash. Thank you so much for the update Charlie Pellet really do appreciate. I do want to get back to our guest Christopher Marquist, professor of Chinese management at the University of Cambridge. Also the author of the new book Mal and Markets, the Communist Roots of Chinese Enterprise. Chris is back with us once again via zoom from the Pittsburgh area. So Professor Marquist, I wanted to get right to the question that I started to ask at the end and then we ran out of time. It's the idea that you mentioned all the things about the environment in China today explaining the concerns about human rights abuses and how a lot of what we see or some of what we see come from there don't necessarily run in tandem with the values that a lot of liberal democracies would espouse. How do you explain American companies and multinational companies desire then to do business in China and to do business in China according to the way that the Communist Party of China wants business done? Yeah, that's a really great question. A really challenging issue for companies not just from the US but really around the world. First of all, I want to say, of course they're interested in the market. China has a population of 1.4 billion people, GDP that I think, not on a per capita basis but on aggregate basis the largest in the world. So there's a lot of economic opportunities in China which businesses that are globalizing may want to take advantage of. But I think businesses have to have clear lines so to speak as to what they will do and what they won't do as far as their values and ethics and how that conforms to the beliefs of the societies that they are part of. So clearly human rights is an issue. You have to know that you'll be dealing with the government in a very deep and potentially invasive way and you have to be ready for that. The NBA which was banned for a while in China, I talked to some of the leaders there before after they were banned which was because one of the owners or excuse me one of the general managers tweeted about a support of Hong Kong protests. So you're talking about Darryl Mori. A few years ago. Of course, exactly. And they said, you know, we the big error we made is we did.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1642,2022-11-21 21:52:46
19029," and con protests. You're talking about Dara Mori. A few years ago. Of course, exactly. Exactly. They said, the big error we made is we did not really know anyone in the government to help both understand the government's point of view and try to influence things to get back on the air. You really have to actually engage with and understand the CCP in the government. That was, with that said, Professor, what would you advise companies? Would you say that, given what you know and what your research and reporting tells you for writing this book, would you say that it's not worth it for businesses to do business there? I think it depends on the industry, to be honest, but I would not say it's not worth it in any sort of blanket way. The reason being is that engagement between the US and China is absolutely essential for, I don't know, it might sound like a hyperbole, but for the future of humanity in some ways, I think if the more and more tension and isolation, there will be less cooperation on important things like climate change, potentially could escalate to some sort of war situation over maybe Taiwan or something. It may sound extreme, but I guess my point is that I really think that it's important for us to find ways to effectively engage because with person to person diplomacy, so to speak, interaction is how we are able to actually build bridges in the world. If we don't engage, we will fail to understand China and the Chinese system and make it harder in the future for us to compete with them and even cooperate. So I do think it's important in spite of the difficulties and difference and values to continue talking and to continue engaging. Do you think that there's any companies or even sectors broadly that have done a particularly good job of that type of engagement? Yeah, so I do think that some on the entertainment side, so I think the NBA, they did have that sort of issue, but they've done a lot of great work with different localities in China, work with the Chinese basketball association, helping get that started and up and running, Yao Ming, who is the head of that, former Rockets star himself, has played a big role in that, excellent relations with local governments. I think that other culture industries, although that's actually been a challenge because there's been more and more censorship. So I would say culture is one that has done reasonably well. What do you see in terms of the future of companies there? I asked this in such a blanket way to ask it, but truly you see a company like Apple and it's my go-to because Apple is not just an important company in terms of selling products to Chinese consumers, but also manufacturing products there. The company has said it's moving to a certain extent, trying to untie itself a little bit. What do you see? Yeah, no, definitely. I think it's a huge challenge for Apple to do that. You look at, they talk about moving to Vietnam or India. Vietnam is a population, I think, of 95,000. Chinese, the laboring force, migrant labor that comes from the rural parts of China to the work and the factories that are mostly in the east, is hundreds of millions of people, like two or three hundred million people. So the labor flexibility and skill that exists in China has been built up over decades. I think it's going to be hard for Apple to move. I think that many companies as well, and this, I think, is the real leverage that actually China has over companies like Apple, some that's about the market, but others that's about actually not being able to replicate the supply chain. Hey, Professor, we got to leave it there, but thank you so much for joining us. Really appreciate you taking the time this afternoon.

Joining us this afternoon via Zoom from Pittsburgh. Katie, before we go, I want to get to a headline that Charlie hit, the crypto firm, Genesis, warning of a possible bankruptcy without funding. You've been covering this story very closely. Bring us the updates. So Genesis here, warning of a possible bankruptcy without funding. This is according to people familiar with the matter that they've spent the past several days seeking at least $1 billion in fresh capital that didn't include talks over a potential investment from finance. That's a familiar name. And remember, Genesis did hall draws last week. This is a crypto lender. And we know that that space has been under a lot of pressure for months now. But all stemming from this most recent round stemming from FTX is collapse. Exactly. All right, much more to come. And also be sure to tune in a little bit later, because Joe Matthew is going to be covering the latest when it comes to politics with Sound On. You're listening to Bloomberg Business Week, Tim Stenevegan, Katie Griefeld. We are live in the Bloomberg Interactive Broker Studio. And that is going to do it for our program this afternoon.

19031," MUSIC I'm Caroline Hyde, a Bloomberg's World Take Quarters in New York. And I'm Ed Ludlow in San Francisco. This is Bloomberg Technology. Bob Iger's Return as Disney CEO comes as the company deals with challenges both internal and external. The biggest priorities for the comeback king of content. And Genesis is warning of a bankruptcy without new funding as Coinbase hits a record low. The entire industry faces a liquidity crunch. And we've learned US prosecutors opened a probe of FTX months before it's collapsed. Plus we'll break down how tech layoffs create a wave of issues for non-US citizens that worked for Silicon Valley giants. But first Ed, let's check in on these markets. Let's go broader. Because overall there was a little bit of risk aversion in the market. Remember volumes are low. We have a holiday short and weak ahead of Thanksgiving celebrations in the US. S&P 500, off by 4.10% the technology sector really under some pressure. Roughly more than a percentage point on the NASDAQ. Remember it's off of their lows of the day. But nevertheless, stress as we see. More people focusing on what the Federal Reserve will have to do now to contain inflation. Whether or not they will indeed be hiking rates still at a pace of 50 or 75 basis points as rates go higher. Many feel, of course, the desire to get into tech stocks goes that little bit lower. So money moves out. Crane shares CSI China. Now interestingly, I've been looking at the ETF that tracks the ETF giants. And actually they had been lower on the day. This is we all look towards not just what the Fed does in the US, but Ed. What is happening in terms of China? COVID outbreaks once again, deaths? Does that mean that we will see, of course, the Catelman of the economy going forward. China had been trading lower. But this particular ETF at the moment, the China Crane shares won just flat or up a percentage point on the end of trade. Let's flick it on. Let's look at what's happening cross asset. Let's look at what's happening in terms of Bitcoin. A two-day chart here. Look how much has been falling down 6%. We know it's a volatile asset class. But overall, Ed, we want to focus in what's been happening in the crypto world. Yet further headlines, particularly when it comes to Genesis just in this hour alone. Yeah, and that crypto contagion also spilling over to the equity markets, Caroline. In particular, Coinbase closing at a record low. Interesting though, because while that stock is at a record low, we see Caffe would in arc buying 1.3 million shares of Coinbase, buying the dip so far in the month of November, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Some other move as we're looking at draft kings down 5% users reporting issues with their accounts weighing on the stock. Tesla is now down 25% since October 28th when Elon Musk closed his deal to buy Twitter. Obviously, some concern that Musk has distracted away from Tesla. But also, there is the impact of these COVID shutdowns in China and the question of how that will impact manufacturing at the Shanghai plant. And then Disney, we've got to talk about Disney. Up 6% Bob Iger is back, Caroline. In the CEO, Bob Chepek is departed the company. This is amazing price chart, right? You just look at the stock over the last two years. And remind yourself about the story behind Disney. Disney plus launched at the end of 2019. Chepek doesn't even take the help until the early stages of the pandemic in 2020. And then you have this roller coaster ride with the share price rising to mid 2021 and eventually falling away as we get concerns over the subscriber growth and just how expensive the losses are for this streaming business. And then right on the file hand right hand side of your screen, Iger is back as CEO. So much to digest with this story. We're going to be focusing so much more on what's happening with Disney. But first and foremost, let's get to the breaking news as Bloomberg is reporting the digital asset brokerage. You just say, Genesis, struggling to raise fresh cash for a lending unit and it's warning potential investors that it may, we say, may need to file for bankruptcy if it's if it's fail. So according to sources and Shanali Bacek is here because she was indeed one of the bylines on the story, one of the key reporters and Shanali talked to us thus far, Genesis coming back and saying, look, this is an imminent, but they have been trying to raise funds for some while now, right? They have been trying to raise funds for days. Remember, they had halted withdrawals at the lending unit just last week in the middle of last week. And since then, they have been in talks with investors, including now we're reporting finance. Now funding has so far failed to materialize and they have been warning a group of investors.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1645,2022-11-21 22:05:45
19032," Funding has so far failed to materialize and they have been warning a group of investors that they may need to file for bankruptcy Certainly at the lending unit if those talks do not materialize into funding now remember genesis is a huge player in the institutional space Their trading desk has separately reported an exposure to FTX But we are now starting to see more effects of what has happened here that you could argue was contagion that started back to three Arrows let alone currently when it comes to the FTX debacles Chenali what's happening behind the scenes how much cash to the Genesis think they need is this happened in the last 24 hours in the last two weeks What's happening behind closed doors days remember they halted withdrawals in the middle of last week Let's say Wednesday and then they had over the days after that starting to look for money with the way that my Sources describe what was happening was that a lot of these talks really amplified into the weekend And again remember that this is still they have not filed yet They are not said that they're going to file yet They have told us on the record by the way that they don't have plans to file imminently and their goal is to resolve the current situation Concentually without the need for a bankruptcy filing But as we know that this is still a huge risk now remember Ed There are benefits to bankruptcy as well. It would contain a situation here And remember this is part of the broader digital currency And we do not have indications that this is a broader problem when you look at this empire that was built by Barry Silver So I think that is a very important part of this story here which assets within that empire we are talking about And how far that contagion can potentially go as we as we plan for a potential bankruptcy for this unit Yeah, just talk to us a little bit about digital currency group as well and the efforts that will already be made By Barry Silver to we'll prop up that entire industry group because thus far it has been noted that money has been Put there to ensure that certainly post three arrows the implications weren't too destructive It's an important question remember after three arrows a part of the empire here was said do have been a creditor to the three arrows group So why is that so important today because as investors look at this asset to the point that you are getting at here Is that they do want to entangle the relationship between Genesis lending Genesis trading and the rest of digital currency group now Remember the rest of the empire is super important to the crypto space That includes a GBTC the gray scale Bitcoin trust grace scale as a company But right now what we do know and I would say I work about tune us over at Bloomberg intelligence has been brilliant at pointing this out The company itself spits off a lot of money based on what they are getting in terms of managing the assets for the gray scale Bitcoin trust So that's why again, it's so important here to say what is revenue generating what is still okay today and what parts of the business here are we more concerned about but then importantly for investors What is the relationship between all the entities at the end of the day All right Bloomberg's Chaneli Balsac. Thank you. Let's turn now to Disney after the bombshell announcement the Bob Iger is coming back to the company Ross Gerber is CEO and co-founder of Gerber Karrasakini two billion dollars in assets under management and importantly Caroline a Disney shareholder So Ross your reaction Oh, I was so happy when I saw the news last night I thought I was dreaming and and it was like my dream came true I Bob Chepack had had been running the business into the ground and had made some crucial errors and handling some very difficult situations But it was time to really refocus the business back on creating great content for a reasonable cost Okay, so Ross in terms of your prioritization here and I want to bring to our audience a poll that we went to Twitter We then know you're a big player on Twitter with hundreds of thousands of followers But we've been shining a light on what they think the prioritization should be now Is it the cost controls? Is it more thinking about content the streaming perspective at the moment? Is it Ross actually of course? What is the internal management of this business because Bob Chepack himself had made some Well very criticized decision-making when it came to the politics within Florida and the will the company stands for from your perspective streaming strategy is number one for our audience right here right now Is it number one for you? Yeah, for sure. I mean the streaming business that they've built over the last several years is amazing And it was really led by Iger at the beginning to get into streaming and and so they got to",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1646,2022-11-21 22:10:07
19033," Yeah, for sure. I mean, the streaming business that they've built over the last several years is amazing. And it was really led by Iger at the beginning to get into streaming. And so they got to this point where they now have hundreds of millions of subscribers, but their losses have balloon. And I'm not really sure why there was such a lack of focus on the cost controls, especially last quarter, because the rest of the business like parks and resorts and as well as the hotels and the cruise ships and the cruise ships, many elements of the business are booming right now and hugely profitable. So we actually expected Disney to beat profits nicely this quarter. And it was like, where did this extra billion spent on on the streamers go? And so, you know, Disney plus and Hulu have our great assets, ESPN plus. They're great assets and they've had a lot of money invested, but it's time to make this business profitable and make sense economic. Ross, let's bring you some of what Bob said in a statement Sunday night when he was named as CEO. First of all, he seems as surprised as the rest of us using the word amazement, but he also talks about these times remain quite challenging, I suppose, referring to macro conditions. You talked about profit. You can't just turn the tap off and suddenly the losses from streaming go away and everything's dandy. How materially does he fix things at Disney? Well, I think you've got really, I would say three main issues that Disney faces. So the first which we've been discussing is how do we build a streamer with the right economics and it's actually not that hard because you do have a certain level of certainty of what your revenue is going to be because it's a reoccurring revenue model. So Disney and Apple just recently raised prices on their streamers. So they can pretty well guess what they're going to take in revenue. What they're going to take in revenue. Why is over the next 12 months? And they just need to right size the budget for it. So that that isn't that big of a deal. You just have to do the right math. The second thing Disney needs to address is China. This is the really big, difficult challenge that many of my companies are facing whether it be Disney, MGM and Macau or Tesla and Shanghai. You know, we're just facing so much uncertainty in the Shanghai park is closed again. And this is a big challenge for them despite the rest of the park's business doing extremely well. And then the third thing is what are they going to do with their sports business? I personally love the ESPN brand and business and I think that they need to be deeper in sports and deeper in sports betting. And if not just get out of the sports business and and spin it off or sell the ESPN brand. But I think they need to make a decision on what they're going to do with sports in the future. Now I think Disney should stay in the sports business. But I think I will assess these things and make some great decisions. And soon enough we're likely to see the manitization in some parts of Disney Plus. I'm interested in the people behind Disney Plus, the executives. I mean we know that Bob Eiger might well be thinking of his LGBTQ plus community and how he's sponsored them post the politicization of all of that. But talk to us about the executives who in studio roles. Talk about the people who perhaps were given a backseat under Chaipek and how that changes. So, what do you think about the people who are going to be in the industry? What do you think about changes? So, this part of Disney was going back to Eiger's days when they bought Fox. So, when they integrated Fox there was this like almost a lot of the Disney people left and Fox people on the television and the movie side sort of stayed. And that's been good, I think, for Disney. But I think Chaipek really was not great with talent. And I don't think he had any vision for the artist or the artistry part of making the magic of the Disney. And that's what Eiger has that is really hard to quantify. So, I think this is like a really big thing is I do think they have great executives managing their businesses. But I think they need some direction as far as content is concerned and sort of like somebody with taste. And that's what Eiger has that Chaipek certainly doesn't. But I still think the integration of Disney and Fox in a way is still not a hundred percent complete. And I think there needs to be this finale. And I think that's the most important part of the story. And I think it's really complete. And I think there needs to be this finality to it. Ross, did you buy more Disney shares on Monday? Well, you know, I run a public ETF GK is my ETF, and I did buy Disney today and I don't know if that's been actually hosted yet. I",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1647,2022-11-21 22:14:44
19034," Well, you know, I run a public ETF, GK is my ETF and I did buy Disney today and I don't know if that's been actually posted yet. But it's posted anyways at five o'clock Eastern. So markets are closed. So I did buy Disney aggressively today. All right, let's think about the other company. I think it's wildly undervalued. I think it's wildly undervalued and with Iger back, I think it's a whole other business to look at now. Another business to look at. Twitter, you're an investor in the private entity. Bloomberg reported that layoffs continued Monday focused on sales and marketing. What do you make of that? Well, I think you're going to see the same thing Disney. So I think if you look at tech companies across the board, Twitter included probably more extreme than most is we're seeing this resizing of the tech industry across the entire industry. And that's really part of that is from the pandemic boom to now bust. And now, you know, also just a more realistic view of what costs and content are going to be used and achieved. But Twitter was wildly overstaffed and now they're going to move to a staff level that's probably wildly understaffed. And then they're going to build. And they're going to build by hiring. So I think people are thinking like, oh, this is going to like be the permanent size of Twitter will be extremely small. And I don't think that's correct. What this is going on is a corporate restructuring where a new culture is being built at Twitter. And one that will be much more productive for the company, the users and its shareholders. You're perspective there, Ross. I'm interested in what though might occur with a lack. You say it's wildly understaffed. Are there risks? Are there concerns while it is so? Well, I've been, you know, monitoring Twitter, you know, very closely from my own experiential point of view to see if there has been any change. And I've actually would argue that Twitter is better now that Elon's taken over than before the engagement on Twitter has been off the charts over the last couple of weeks. Not to mention all the news and information, but Twitter is still the most incredible source of news besides Bloomberg when you're looking at Sam Bankman freed live tweeting during his fraud. It's only on Twitter. And so whether if I want news on Ukraine, I'm sorry, I have to go to Twitter. And so it's a crucially important news and information site and one that Elon is working very hard to protect its integrity. And I think Twitter is as good as ever. Ross, as an investor in Twitter, who wants a long term return, one thing you want to see Elon must do with the platform. Add, add creator engagement opportunities. So by adding YouTube and, you know, these kind of features where creators can get on the platform and make a living, we post a lot of video on Twitter and YouTube and everybody has to monetize through YouTube. So I think the creator opportunity on Twitter as a platform is enormous. And I think YouTube should be scared. All right, Ross Gerber CEO and co-founder of Gerber Kawasaki. Thank you. Coming up, we'll have the latest on the ticket master and Taylor Swift debacle and the DOJ's role in all of this. This is Blaineberg.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1648,2022-11-21 22:18:47
19035,", yourself if if Let's talk about Live Nation's ticket master, the system crash, that of course dashed the hopes of many retailers with fan for a concept ticket. Turns out, not long after the Justice Department started probing into all of this, to seek whether Live Nation is abusing its power over the live music industry. That's all according to sources. And please say Bloomberg Intelligence. Jennifer Rhee is here with more on this said because we want to be discussing with Jennifer the great deck that she put out for Bloomberg Intelligence about, well, actually reminding us, this is the first time the DOJ has got interested in what was an M&A done years ago. Jennifer. Yeah, so you know, this has been going on for a really long time. You know, I think the Taylor Swift debacle kind of brought this to the headlines, but honestly, there have been critics of Live Nation and groups that have called for the deal that was closed in 2010 to be unwound by the DOJ really ever since it closed. And the DOJ started investigating after settling with the companies in 2010, probably as early as 2012, only a few years after they actually were merged because they believed that they were already violating a consent agreement that they'd signed in 2010. Now, I don't know exactly when that investigation started, but what it ended was in 2019. And the DOJ said, in fact, we do believe they've been violating these terms. They were supposed to behave in a certain way toward venues. They promised to behave in that way, not to force or coerce the venues to use ticket master, allow them to use rivals to ticket master. And in fact, they've re-nigged on that. So we're going to, and turn another settlement with them. And that settlement was signed in late 2019. And now I think what's going to happen is the DOJ is going to look again to see, are they still violating that newer amended agreement from 2019? And are they even doing more in the market that's anti-competitive? Jen, what's the threshold this time around? What is it that they'd be looking for that would be enough for an enforcement action? You know, that's a good question. And they actually have two different thresholds because the consent order that they agreed to in 2019 lowered the threshold. This is something live nation agreed to for the DOJ to show that they'd been violating that consent order. So if they're trying to show that, hey, they agreed to this, they're not abiding by these terms, we have a pretty low threshold to prove that that's what's happening in court. So that's one threshold. I think this is the kind of proof and evidence that's fairly easy for the DOJ to collect. They just go out and talk to venues and find out what their communications have been with live nation and with ticket master. But I think the second thing the DOJ might be looking at is more broadly is live nation and ticket master entering and do exclusive agreements with so many big venues that they're basically blocking out small arrivals who can no longer contract with those venues because they're exclusive to ticket master. That's a little bit of a higher threshold. Something I think they could also prove in court though. If you are a company with market dominance and it's alleged here that live nation.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1649,2022-11-21 22:23:15
19036," That's a little bit of a higher threshold. Something I think they could also prove in court though. If you are a company with market dominance, and it's alleged here that live nation does have market dominance, it is illegal to tie up more than about 35 to 40% of the outlet. And if that's what they're doing with these exclusive agreements or quasi-exclusive agreements, that would violate the antitrust laws. Jennifer, 2010, when the merger occurred as the long time ago. Yes. Talk to us about the speed at which any of this could unfold. Well, it's really slow. I mean, as you heard, the merger was in 2010, according to the DOJ, when they came out with papers in 2019, the deal had been violated since 2012. Right? And they didn't settle until 2019. So these investigations can go over two or three years. But I think that the DOJ investigation that's ongoing now did start a few years ago. You know, I went back and I looked at how often we at Bloomberg intelligence had published about antitrust problems live nation could have. And we wrote in 2018. We wrote in 2019 and we wrote in 2020. So I think it's very possible something could happen next year in 2023 and enforcement action more likely than a settlement. All right, Bloomberg intelligence is Jennifer Rief. Thank you. Thank you. Coming up, Carro, our top tech calls of the day. Stay with us for the stocks. You should focus on. And as we head to break, let's take a look at zoom. The stock down almost 75% sorry in late trading after reporting its slowest quarterly sales growth on record. Tomorrow, we talked to zoom's CFO, Kelly Steckelberg, about the company's fight to reverse this slow down in growth. You don't want to miss it. This is Bloomberg.

It's a great ones there Ed. Meanwhile coming up we've got so much more to talk about about workers in particular thousands of them have been laid off by tech giants recently and hundreds of those are on temporary work visas. Why the clock is ticking for immigrant engineers. And a clarification for our Bloomberg technology audience during a discussion on Elizabeth Holmes took place this past Friday when she was given an 11 year sentence in misleading investors. We want to clarify that we were not trying to imply that we worked found Adam Newman had committed any wrongdoing by a comparison made. Elizabeth back. Welcome back to Bloomberg Technology.

19038," He's asking Disney managers to reconsider the corporate structure. Already we've started to see that the distribution chief, Karim Daniel, is stepping down. We understand of course this executive was particularly close to Bob Chepek. So Bob Iger is announcing changes in a company memo as it stands. So Karim Daniel being the chairman of Media and Entertainment distribution. We'll continue to bring you all the latest when it comes to Disney and some of the restructuring there. Meanwhile though, there's restructuring going across technology and more broadly mass tech layoffs and left hundreds of workers living here in the United States on just temporary visas. A little, next to no time to find another job. Indeed they have to leave the country. Ed, how could this change the US tech landscape more broadly? Yeah, it's an interesting one. Tech companies rely on the H1B visa for computer engineering talent right from all around the world. The numbers behind this Bloomberg analysis are fascinating. H1B visas captured 85,000 per year. This group of six tech companies on your screen are behind 45,000 of them. Both new and renewed over the last three years. Just those six names alone. As you can see from the chart, H1Bs make up a significant, okay, not a majority but a significant amount of the overall workforce. So to answer your question, if a tech worker is laid off and they have to return home to their home nation as a result of losing their job, there's a cost to the employer that has to be covered for the travel back to that home nation. The cost is also a big part of this story, right? Why a layoffs happening? Cost saving measures is a part of it. H1B visas also carry higher average pay. Generally speaking, the national average of H1B in terms of pay if we bring up that next chart is around $106,000 per H1B visa employee. But you look across the tech sector again, those same six names. That average pushes higher and higher in terms of the salary that an H1B visa employee can command. And things are changing. Think about all the reporting we've done recently, Caroline, on Twitter, those staff that have been laid off here in the United States and the reporting that the Bloomberg has done about them trying to find new roles talking with recruiters. I really encourage the audience, go on Bloomberg.com, get your business week, magazine hard copy, and take a look at this story, fascinating data analysis. And all over LinkedIn, many getting on to communication with across WhatsApp. Using any technology outlet really possible to try and find a new sponsor. Aisha White, Dixon White Chief, People Officer and Legal Advisor, can bring us her expertise. She of course previously held legal in HR positions at Disney, at WeWork. And Aisha, this is a really emotional time for many. The dependency of certain people upon their company's response to them let them remain a mortgage pair in the US. Their children remain at school here overall. The building blocks of a life they make. We're hearing that certain companies are taking different ways of supporting them. We know that Meta, for example, trying to find ways to delay some of that overall notification and notice period that people serve. What are the best ways companies can make this transition? I think the best way is to A be honest about what they can do, what they can fund and what they can afford right now. I think that if you are on an H1B visa and you are in the middle of your visa stay, trying to get on with another tech company would be amazing at this point, although it seems like the largest tech companies are setting for layoff right now. So maybe looking at a smaller tech company that still has a budget and the ability to sponsor. But I think from a company standpoint, companies are looking at the talent that they cannot lose no matter what and keeping those people sponsored. And for other people, they are trying to get them an extension for as long as they can because there are so many people who have adjusted their lives, believing that they would be in the US sponsored by an employer. From a more macro perspective, time and time again, everyone's wondered when this is going to show up in the numbers, when the non-farm payrolls are going to show some of the job layoffs that we're seeing in technology. And the response I've been getting is, look, these are very talented individuals who will find it very quick to find another role. Is that the case? Are we a wash with jobs in the moment? Because I seem to just hear of job freezes in the tech world. So in the tech world, I think honestly, 50% of the people who are being laid off will find another job very quickly. What is happening is that there are layoffs and there are a lot of job freezes at this point. Even if they're on area of responsibility,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1652,2022-11-21 22:36:11
19039," people who are being laid off will find another job very quickly. What is happening is that there are layoffs and there are a lot of job freezes at this point. Even if and it's the holiday season, right? The holiday season is a very, very slow time for hiring all around the U.S. So what we have here is two things that are working against people. One is layoff and freezes. The second is the holiday season. But I think even if we look at 2023, once we look at January or February, we're only really talking about 50% of the people receiving jobs again. Because everyone isn't a software engineer that's being laid off. It is across the spectrum and HR, legal, finance, operations. And so all of those jobs, even though they're intact, don't necessarily get picked up as quickly. Eisha, I want to leverage your professional background, your experience. We've done a lot of reporting here at Bloomberg about what has happened at Twitter, right? Down the road from the market street, people being locked out of the building, the HR department being let go. And so those administering the layoffs, not being sort of qualified HR people. You know, Eila must tweet it over the weekend pictures of him working late into the night with this new team of engineers. But what is your assessment of how that process was handled? I want to be completely honest and transparent. This was probably the worst mass layoff I've ever seen in my 20 years of being an employment lawyer. I think, you know, Eila and Cayman as an individual versus a businessman and really look to take over a company and is using it like it's a toy versus a company at this point. He did not come in and work with the chief people officer who is the chief people and diversity officer to determine the skills that he had within the company, the knowledge base he had within the company, so he could really make informed decisions about who to let go and who to stay. And everything is showing that he's let go of people who is he's asking to bring back at this point. I mean, there are so many things that he has done that have been really unfortunate and it's playing with people's lives, their salaries, their medical benefits, and their retirement benefits. I mean, this just kind of goes against everything that we say is in best practice of HR. And it's really unfortunate. On the other hand, Eisha, he does have a track record of getting the best out of people, especially when they're under duress. Does the end justify the means? Absolutely not. Absolutely not. I mean, and I would eat my words in six months to a year if something is different. But honestly, right now he's working with a bare bones crew, a crew that doesn't appear to be diverse, a crew that is looking like they're going to burn out. And honestly, a number of people that I know who have continued with Twitter are looking and they are just looking for their next best opportunity. I think the landscape of employment has changed considerably since COVID. No one wants to work and work until they drop anymore. It is just not that type of employment landscape. And so I understand that Elon has had people who will stick along with him for this ride for a short duration. But I do not believe that he has created enough goodwill or that he has a good enough reputation even within Tesla to bring people from Twitter who had really kind of dedicated their skills and everything to Twitter to bring them alongside what he's trying to do. He's just not communicating enough. He's not really showing the roadmap to everyone. And the things that he's done from laying off people at the top, all the way down with no severance, no notice. It's not a way to keep a company going. Or employing a route. Aisha, it's interesting just to play Davos Advocate here. You say the landscape has changed, but the economic landscape is changing with it. And before we really had the pendulum swing in the direction of talent, of employees, we're now, we've got to slow down in the economy and people are more fearful of their jobs. Is there a risk here that the focus on diversity, on inclusion, the re-alignment of what we thought our purpose for work was? Does shift again as we start to get more fearful? I don't think that it will shift. I think that some things will take a pause. I definitely believe that budgets within the DE and I space, the budgets within the culture space are going to pause. I think they really are. Because in some companies, they believe that that is a nice to have versus a must-have. But in terms of what we need, honestly, from a bear-b...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1653,2022-11-21 22:40:40
19040," I think they really are because in some companies they believe that that is a nice to have versus a must-have But in terms of what we need Honestly from a bare bones perspective to have a company run which is top talent Top talent can go anywhere and the question is why would they want to work for you? Elon at this point is not offering increased salaries increased flexibility Nothing he is saying. Hey, please buy into this dream that I have of how I can really make Twitter something Even better than it already was and I don't know if he has a lot of people along for the ride in terms of the other tech companies There are some tech companies that have really done it right who are not abandoned in D.E. and I and some of the other things like strife I think that you don't abandon these principles But sometimes you do need to take a pause budgetarily in order to focus on operations Okay, I issue white Dixon white chief people officer and legal advisor. Thank you Now Bloomberg Cameron Leach is on the case with the Twitter saga and reported more layoffs today. Can what do we learn? It's been a lot. This has been happening over the past 36 supported hours for employees at Twitter We could say even from our own reporting starting off on Sunday Work as woke up to a to a new calendar invite Sunday morning and then by Midday Sunday there was a all hands meeting affecting basically just trying to give a new direction for where Twitter was going to go By the time it came around to Monday Workers had learned that they've been fired they had been let go which only until January that they'd get They'll still be paid and considered to be an employee as well too and more specifically this affected the sales team And this came as a complete shock specifically because the sentiment was that you know They had been shielded from some of these layoffs that we had been reporting Not only have our viewers been watching this employees at Twitter have been watching our reporting as well too because they didn't know What was coming up next but the whole thought process in the sentiment was that they wouldn't be affected by these layoffs because One thing that Twitter needed was revenue and the sales team was a main driving force behind those things So this came as a complete shot for a lot of workers Camera at the moment. I think at the bottom of the story it really shows that at one point it was 7,000 workers before mask We're now looking at an employee internal counter 2,750 How much is there still to go how much do we inherently need to support a Overall social media empire such as Twitter. There's got to be real concern set Yeah, I mean we've all been you know tracking a lot of these you know technology companies big tech companies And we know for sure that Twitter has been a revenue losing Company for some time now and they've just had to cut costs, you know I think they only got down to less than a billion just last year in 2021 and and that was over They were losing about more than a billion dollars. So it's so much money They they have to cut and it seems like Elon thinks that salaries is the best way to do that by decreasing his head count I think the the wills are definitely spending over there I think nobody knows where this rollercoaster is headed next and everybody's on their toes walking on the eggshells Well, camera. That's what I wanted to ask you about you know you and I and the team We have heard from a lot of former and current employees right a lot of sources inside the company Have been confused about what's going on? What is the sentiment among staff that are left at Twitter? Yeah, even for those that are left at Twitter. They as you know Your guests in the last segment said they are still looking externally. They're keeping the training wheels going Because there is no direction. There seems to be a lot of confusion going forward I spoke to a source earlier today and apparently there should be a final all-hands meeting Happening today that kind of gives the direction of where 22.0 will be going and apparently those are the Just only the staff members that are left and that Elon will be keeping with But that was supposed to be the thought with the last all-hands meeting so you never know if this could be the next one It's if this could be the final one So you nobody knows we're sticking close to the situation We'll want to turn on Bloomberg dot com as well Cameron. Thank you so much for bringing us your inside track of the moment Cameron and each as always We thank him and you Ed and cross with all your reporting coming up crypto contagion It worsens Genesis wanting up the possible bankruptcy more on that moment.

19041," with all your reporting coming up crypto contagion it worsens Genesis warning up for possible bankruptcy more than that in moment this is bring back so of Bloomberg scoops in the wild of crypto on Monday. Genesis has warned of a potential bankruptcy if it doesn't get funding and federal prosecutors in Manhattan were already looking into FTX's operation months before it's collapsed. That according to sources. Luckily, Bloomberg, Shnalli, Bassack is here with all the details. Let's start with that FTX investigation. What do we know about regulators and what they were doing with FTX? The FTX was concerned about FTX empire. I would also say, though, remember this is all happening. The Bloomberg scoop that we are discussing here is all happening on the back of a lot of dispute here, Ed, between the Bahamas and the United States and bringing San Benchman freed here to questioning for regulators and lawmakers publicly as we wait to hear what's going to happen with the House Financial Services Committee and the Senate Banking Committee who also want to bring in San Benchman freed for testimony as well as deputies. I would say separately as we think about what's happening with regulators, tomorrow there's going to be a hearing in a Delaware bankruptcy court starting 11 a.m. And so you're hearing both the issues of the FTX empire unravel at the same time as we hear about authorities and their concerns according to sources between the links between FTX and Alameda. Yes, of course, go to further links. Let's go to further contagion. Let's go to genesis right now because your scoop just before us coming on air, the fact that they may have to fail at filed for bankruptcy. The focus right now is this is not imminent and they're looking for other sources of funds. Now remember, something that's interesting about not just the breaking news that we have today, as well as what we've had, as we've been talking about, US authorities looking at FTX over months, this is just another indication that some of these issues go back many months.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1655,2022-11-21 22:49:24
19042," Today, as well as what we've had, as we've been talking about, U.S. authorities looking at FTX over months, this is just another indication that some of these issues go back many months, that they go back to three arrows, for example, and whoever had a relationship with them. Remember, Genesis is one of those companies that did have links to both three arrows and FTX at this point in time. They were a large creditor when you looked at their relationship to three arrows. And now, let's talk about it in the vein of FTX for a second, because we know the trading does, because it had about $175 million tied up with FTX, but the lending business separately has had to pause with draws. So here come the questions. What were the relationships then between Genesis lending and Genesis trading? Genesis lending trading and the rest of the Zijal currency group empire? How much does that actually matter at the end of the day? And are some of these questions not just a matter of, you know, customer money tied up in one exchange or one lender, but is there a broader systemic issue here in the way customer funds are being used among crypto companies more largely as a comes to lending and trading activities? OK, so one that we continue to ask questions on, and of course, cast no aspersions, but continue to dig deep as you do, with all the relative really tentacles of this business. We thank you, Shana Ali Baskik. Meanwhile, coming up, we want to talk a little bit about FIFA, the backlash going viral on day two of the World Cup. This is Brin Bag. In 2010, FIFA announced that Qatar would host the 2022 World Cup. In its bid, the country promised to make it a carbon neutral tournament. But as the matches approach, environmentalists are claiming that Qatar has greenwash the World Cup, and that the event will put millions of megatons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. So that claim is mostly a PR play. Essentially, there is no way that a mega event of that size can be carbon neutral. FIFA can do better and should do better, and my focus would be on encouraging to do that for the next World Cup. The UN defines carbon neutrality or achieving net zero carbon emissions as balancing a measured amount of carbon released with an equal amount offset. First step is to measure your emissions. And so that's what FIFA has done for the World Cup. We looked into that calculation and we think that this is quite significant on the estimated. So there's two big challenges.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1656,2022-11-21 22:53:47
19043," and so that's what FIFA has done for the woke up. We looked into that calculation and we think that this is quite significant on the estimated. So there's two big challenges with any carbon neutrality claim at an event of this size. The first one is travel. And the second part of this is construction. 75% of carbon footprint of all sports stadium over their entire lifetime is locked in on day one from the materials that built from. It's not about operating costs. It's about concrete steel. Qatar has invested billions of dollars in infrastructure for the tournament, including building seven new stadiums. Organizers estimate that the world cup will emit 3.6 megatons of carbon dioxide. The construction of the stadium is the most problematic elements because it's the element that we think was most massively underestimated. From that factor, we think the total footprint would be five million tons. International flights in and out of Doha will account for the majority of emissions. However, organizers argue that this world cup will be more energy efficient than others since fans won't have to fly to different venues and can instead just take public transit. The sticking point is always the flights. Most Olympics and world cups, it accounts to more than 85% of total emissions. Balancing carbon emissions with offsets is key to carbon neutrality. So far, Qatar has purchased less than 350,000 carbon and offset credits of the 3.6 million needed in their estimation. The Supreme Committee says that it has already secured a minimum of 1.5 million credits from the global carbon council and that further details will be forthcoming. So far, greenwashing issues are not keeping fans from rooting for their teams on the pitch. An estimated 1.7 million people will be in attendance with over 3 million tickets sold. But with a warmer future ahead, effects on fans will soon be felt. Sport is the most enormous opportunity to tackle the climate crisis because we can engage football fans and make them advance of the environment through their favourite sport. Now going viral, let's stick with FIFA, let's stick with seven national football teams, including England who will not wear a rainbow armband, showing solidarity with LGBTQ plus rights, bowing instead to pressure from FIFA because players might receive a yellow card for the show of support. Qatar has been under intense scrutiny leading up to the World Cup of course, over the treatment of migrant workers as well as concerned with human rights and its criminalisation of homosexuality. Now one gay rights group, Stonewall, says that by threatening sporting sanctions and stopping players from wearing the one love armbands, FIFA are brushing criticism of human rights abuses under the carpet. Human rights campaign, a Peter Tachal noted, look two days ago, FIFA president spoke of inclusivity about this ruling, shows actually his true colours. I urge the team captains at their post-match post conferences to spend just 30 seconds to speak out for the rights of women, LGBTs and migrant workers. That would have a huge impact he says. And for me also, the Iranian team, not singing their national anthem and of course over the course of this weekend, going viral, that shocking news out of Colorado Springs, it makes it a very intense time for the LGBTQ plus community, particularly in the US. Yeah, and we see on social media it's having an impact on the armbands, you know, captains saying that they thought that they would face a fine rather than something relating to kit rather than a sporting sanctioned, serious things. That does it, Caroline, for this edition of Bloomberg Technology. On Tuesday though, we've got Zoom CFO, Kelly Steckelberg, to discuss earnings and the growing competition in video conferencing.

19045," For most of the history of spaceflight, governments have been the prime force behind nearly every aspect, from planning to funding to cruise selection. But as early as the 1980s, proposals for commercial space tourism began to emerge, along with innovative solutions for getting people there, such as the wild concept of sticking a 74-person passenger cabin in the cargo bay of a NASA space shuttle. Although various non-astronauts have been selected for missions over the years, true space tourism didn't happen until 2001. When an entrepreneur named Dennis Tito coughed up an estimated $20 million to hitch a ride with the Russian Federal Space Agency for a week-long vacation aboard the International Space Station. 20 years later, we're seeing a new contender in this final frontier of tourism. Private companies. It's becoming a private enterprise situation, still very high risk with the high reward, potential reward. But government is really out of the business of flying people now, and it's really going to be companies like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos and Richard Branson that do that heavy lifting. Commercial space tourism is usually about taking the non-astronaut, the private citizen into an orbital or suborbital flight, so you get a short amount of microgravity experience, and you can float and take some photos. And then you come back. This was something that technology had gotten to a point where the private sector was going to make a business out of this. There are multiple companies that want to get to the place where they fly people into space. The first of these is Blue Origin, founded in 2000 by Jeff Bezos. Using the autonomous rocket system New Shepherd, a tribute to the first American in space, Blue Origin plans to launch up to six passengers at a time, offering a rarefied treat of 62 mile high views and a momentary experience of weightlessness. Boking officially kicked off in May 2021, with the very first seat to be auctioned off for charity. Meanwhile, Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic has also been pursuing a viable form of suborbital tourism. Aiming for a launch in 2022, once Sir Richard himself has taken flight. I'm hoping to be able to go to space. I'd love to be able to coincide with the moon landing and go to space. So I've got the whip on the team and we'll see how he goes. The company claims to have lined up over 600 seat reservations so far, including Justin Bieber and Leonardo DiCaprio. Virgin has projected that the final cost of the ticket will be at least $250,000, or roughly $50,000 for each of the five minutes or so of weightlessness that you'll get to experience. Although costly, both companies' offerings aim to make suborbital flight a regular form of adventure travel, eventually driving down costs at scale to expand the customer base beyond the orbit of celebrities and billionaires. The third major contender is Elon Musk's SpaceX, which has set its sights even higher on orbital flights, which are... A whole other level of complexity and energy and danger. When you go suborbital, if you're just going to go up above the Vom Carmen line, which is 100 kilometers, or about 62 miles, you'll need to get up to maybe 5,000 miles an hour to get up there and you go basically straight up and straight back down. You don't have the reentry heating that you would see coming in from an orbital. So when you go orbital, I don't care if you're a baseball or a battleship. You've got to go 17,500 miles per hour, not just 5,000 miles an hour. The energy is involved, or much greater. By doing that, SpaceX has gone another level up and that's what they're doing with the Inspiration 4. Visit Inspiration4.com for your chance to go to space. Inspiration 4 is the first planned all-civilian mission into orbit, slated to launch in late 2021. The crew will bring their own set of diverse perspectives and backgrounds and experiences to test how a group of different people, namely people who aren't professional astronauts, could affair in space. Until now, astronauts have had to be physically perfect, and this mission is changing that. And so I feel incredibly honored to be representing those who aren't physically perfect. At H10, I was diagnosed with bone cancer, and I was treated at St. G Children's Research Hospital. And I spent a year there undergoing intense chemo and also surgery that ultimately saved my leg. I now work at...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1659,2022-11-21 23:06:28
19046," Intense chemo and also surgery that ultimately saved my leg. I now work at St. Jude as a PA, a physician assistant, and I work with leukemia and lymphoma patients. The kids we work with are so brave and they are very excited to watch me go to space because this is showing them that, you know, they're capable of doing this as well. Hey Lee, along with three other crew members, we'll spend three days in space orbiting the earth every 90 minutes before landing back off the coast of Florida. Well, when you think about access, the first astronauts for the United States came from the test pilot side and and so women weren't allowed to be a part of that. We have somebody in their 20s, somebody in their 30s, somebody in 40s, and somebody in their 50s. And so there can be access in all kinds of way, whether you're talking about age, whether you're talking about gender, whether you're talking about race and ethnicity and all of those things. The first time, you know, people are going up into space and not sent there by super power, like the United States or Russia or China. Well, that's like really significant. And, you know, you've got to, you know, be very thoughtful about it. The whole game plan right now is to make space like really affordable and, you know, accessible for everybody. So you can have fishing buddies going to space someday, but the first is special. And so with that, we wanted to have, you know, a cruise selection process that could make space available to everyday people. Getting to space is only the first step for space tourism. The next challenge is what to do and where to stay when you get there. Axiom Space is planning to launch the first segment of a new commercial space station in 2024. Their $2 billion project called AxStation will become the first free-flying private international space station or to use a more consumer-friendly term, a space hotel. Axiom isn't the only company out to make your space stay a little more comfortable. Big low-error space has been building what they call expandable Habitat technology, like their B330, an inflatable pod module that expands once in orbit. There's even one attached to the national space station right now they've been testing it. And you take it up and it's rather small and then you inflate it and it seems to be working very, very well. This is likely to be the first kind of tourist hotel that you're going to see up in space. First of all, it's easy to carry instead of this giant tin can with all of that. The inflatables are lighter and you can just blow them up and they get a nice big size for about, you know, half the less than half the weight probably. But even as space missions become accessible to civilians, the risks of going to space are incredibly high and you could die a thousand ways that we can think of and a thousand other ways that we can't think of. This is Michelle Hanlon. She's a space lawyer at the Mississippi School of Law focused on protecting humans in outer space. Now I'm not an attorney for any of the space tours so I haven't been privy to their private contracts but I can tell you that the FAA requires certain waivers to be in those contracts. So for example, the FAA says, well, we're not going to make you make your spacecraft to a certain safety level. We are going to make you spacecraft operator. Make sure that you inform your space tours of all of that hazards that you know of. I imagine a very long waiver all the ways you can die in space. And you have to understand that there's health risks and you have to indemnify the US government if you are launching from the United States. So those are things that we know a space tourist has to sign and has to wave. So now let's go back and think about our space flight participants. The FAA calls space tours space flight participants. They don't call them astronauts. Why is that important? If you're not an astronaut, there's no obligation to rescue you if something goes wrong. It's a lot of money to set up a rescue launch. If it can even be done, it's something really important to think about and that difference as we cross this threshold from having astronauts in space to having real people like me in space. And when we are able to make it to space reliably enough, there's still a host of other legal and ethical issues to consider before space tourism can truly take off. There are so many gaps in space law that we are going to have to put in a lot of sort of basement ideas. And so for example, the outer space treaty is a treaty that offers principles and guidelines for state.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1660,2022-11-21 23:10:50
19047," that we are going to have to put in a lot of sort of basement ideas. And so for example, the outer space treaty is a treaty that offers principles and guidelines for state activities, for the activities of national governments. It doesn't talk about private entities, it doesn't talk about humans in space. So now if something goes wrong, so let's think about all the times hotels on Earth are sued, right? So slip and false, you step on something in the bathroom, you sue the hotel, and it becomes a private lawsuit. Because of the vagaries of international law, if something happens in space, well boy, you can sue the state that launched your spacecraft, you can sue the company that brought you there, you can sue the hotel, you can sue the individual, you can sue every government related to that because the way the outer space treaty and the outer space regime have set this up is that anything that happens in space first has to go through a diplomatic channel before you think about suing an accordive law. And so every single slip and fall in a space hotel is a diplomatic nightmare. And so we really need to figure that out before we start sending a lot of people there. You think about human rights in space. Here we don't think about a human rights oxygen because it's all around us and free. It's not in a space hotel. So what happens if something happens in the oxygen depletes? Who gets the oxygen first? And then of course let's not even think about the labor. How do you treat your labor in a space hotel where that person may be there two or three years without coming back to earth? So a lot of things to think about. Space habitats are more likely in the near future to focus on research missions and be a home for experiments that can't happen as easily back on Earth. Space hotels, I think they garner a lot of headlines and a lot of news, but at the same time that's not the first thing that you're going to see happen. They don't offer the compelling business case. I think that you'll see from a place that wants to manufacture pharmaceuticals or a new type of crystal or some type of filament or fiber optic cables and other things that you can do with microgravity. The things that are actually a high value finished good when you get that back to Earth and you sell it for a very, very huge profit margin. That's what's likely to happen in space as opposed to having a real estate platform that you sell to a tourist by space hotel. It's really interesting and it will probably happen, but it's not likely to be at the forefront of space commerce. Even if space hotels are right around the corner, don't get too excited about booking a trip in one. It's not a cheap ticket to ride to space and it's going to be millionaires and billionaires and that sort. But at the same time, the point was made that in the early days of airline trips, that was also a completely unaffordable ticket for most people. Those people who flew were people of means and over time it becomes affordable to the masses. And I think that's the goal for all the entrepreneurs in space as well to get those costs down to a point where it's not $10 million or $5 million or $300,000 right into sub-article space. When it becomes more like buying a first-class ticket to go to Europe from the United States. So that's the goal and the question is can we get to that point? Given the immense operating costs of getting to space, it may be years, if ever, until space tours and becomes a profitable venture for any of these companies. Virgin Galactic, the only publicly traded company of the three, has had a particularly rocky year, initially riding on the momentum of a SPAC deal. But more recently beset by launch delays and major funders including Branson himself selling large quantities of their stock in the company. Space is really, really, really hard and it's an absolutely shay, but it's one that happens to be very true. It's just really hard to do. That's also the reason that you've seen the delays that Virgin had talked about flying years and years ago. And it became such a crazy point that Richard Branson actually stopped talking about it when he was asked because it was never going to be when he predicted. But it's not insurmountable and you know investors have stepped up because this is something that is doable.

19048," Do we go? Despite the astronomical dangers and costs of getting to space, it may ultimately follow the course of other once fanciful modes of travel. Right, brothers, having, you know, what was by modern standards of very unimpressive first flight, you know, at Kitty Hawk, I mean, you know, you had like less than 20 years later, you had your first airborne ambulances being used to save lives. Fundamentally, the world is a more interesting place when people can go and dance among the stars and such. The lure of space is in a, it's in our DNA. It's that exploration bug. We are in exploratory species and we want to go out there and see what's out there. A vision that I had in 1969 of seeing normal, even being to travel into space, it's finally beginning to happen. When you get a bunch of people up there and they can all see it for themselves, that'll create even yet another revolution in how we treat our planet and what we think about it. So while 2001 came and went without quite looking like Stanley Kubrick's ultimate space fantasy, 2021 might finally be the year we're catching up. If you visit California, you might be inclined to go to Disneyland. We're jumping you're convertible and take highway one up the coast. We may be making pilgrimage to Yosemite, all very fine choices. But if you're the kind of person who revels in our planet's extremes, then it's Route 395 that you're after. This one glorious road will carry you from Death Valley's desert floor to sky high views of Mount Whitney. You can see the 5,000 year old bristle cone pines, the oldest living organisms, or the bizarre two fatowers of Mono Lake. And true to California's boom and bust spirit, you can saunter around the ghost town of Bodhi. What a novel experience to find an empty American city where all the businesses are shut down. To do 395 upright, it helps to have a guide and mine is a man named Jan and his crew. Aaron? Let's do it. Tim Lemmy, the hardest partying dog of all time. Jan agreed to show me some of what 395 has to offer, but only if we agreed not to disclose any locations. My name is Jan Swarostra. I'm an industrial designer out of LA. And I spend a lot of time camping and a lot of time in the Eastern Sierra. It's a place I love. And sometimes I'm known as 395 North because this is my Instagram account. And I don't know.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1662,2022-11-21 23:19:29
19049," Yara, it's a place I love. And sometimes I'm known as 395 North because this, yep, my Instagram account. And I don't like to be known as that, but I'm trying to use it to set a good example and do more with it than just social media. Waited we at a cab, but we got here lay-lays. I was sure where we are. This is BLM Land, right on the outskirts of National Forest. And it's one of my favorite places in the world. Basically, everything outdoors wrapped into one. Yeah. You think about California, man? Oh, man. We have so much National Forest in public land that you can literally just cruise out and find a place to camp. It's ours. What I wish was mine is Yarn's sweet truck. It's a 2019 Ford Ranger. It has about 200 watts of solar in it and a fridge and has everything that an RV has except for a toilet. But just on a smaller, simple scale. You drive us around day-to-day in LA, and then just roll out when you want. It's my daily driver, handles great. And then when I'm done with work, I can just bail and go camping. So the camper basically has only what I need. I think of it as backpacking with a car. Yeah. The fridge has a couple compartments. This is just a kitchen box, stove, utensils, and a bunch of stuff. This one has just dry food. And when you get inside, there's a bed. The bed flips up so you've got tons of room in here. This haunted. This phenomenon. Let's try if you want to pull that over. That's cool. Let me just pop that out. Sort of. So, home on wheels. Yeah. This is my vacation house. Yeah, it was so nice, man. Even with his nomad lifestyle, Jan faces the same big question as the rest of us. Do the internet and smartphones have to ruin everything? When you find the super special beautiful spots, is that you bustin' out a map and like, looking where it might be cool to go, or is it worth a mouth and just gettin' to know people of the locals? And if I see a dirt road, I just want to go down. So a lot of it's just endless rambling. It's a desire to just see something. Check that out. For some reason it's more fulfilling than getting a recommendation room somebody. Or there's tons of apps and websites now. Roadtrip apps, camping apps, they've proliferated. The knowledge is accessible on the internet, right? I used to fight the geotags and I would get really pissed off. You know, like, why are you posting this place? It's gonna blow up. It's gonna get trashed. Now I've realized that you can't fight it. The internet has just shrunk the world. So we're not gonna stop it. We're not gonna stop people from going there. So I'm a lot more focused in conversation now with trying to set a good example. When you go, pick up your trash. When you're poopin' out in the wilderness, don't leave your toilet paper on the top. You know, make sure you follow good steps for leaving no trace. As a thank you for this quick guide to pooping etiquette. We made yawn, hair, and and lemmy some tacos. And we all took in the night sky and knocked back a couple of drinks. Take that apocalypse.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1663,2022-11-21 23:23:57
19050," Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music The thing about good times and serenity in 2020 is that they're fleeting at best. After we split up from Jan and continued on our way, smoke started to envelop us. Music The plus side was that our RV no longer smelled like feet. The downside was breathing. A man David here suggested that we try and outflank the smoke by cutting through your 70. Without a reservation, we had to talk our way in. No stopping, no getting out. Yeah, no problem. We just wanted to get through. It was a beautiful choice. I'd have a smoke. But not quite as effective as we had hoped. Music Fast forward four hours or so and we had managed to trade the smokey majesty of Yosemite for the smokey... Look at it. Strip malls of the Central Valley. We have made it sort of out of the smoke all the way across Yosemite National Park and here to the gorgeous Central Valley of California. We're off to see a kind of surprising tech startup that is making some pretty strange machines to serve all the growers out in this region. Music And where is the where here in this near Fresno? This is California Farm Country, right? We're just out the Fresno town called Kingsburg. So we're right in the Central Valley of California. Very, very large farming valley here. It's kind of considered the red basket of the world. The Central Valley stretches out over about 20,000 square miles and the farmers here produce about one-fourth of the food that Americans eat, including a whole lot of fruits and nuts. Tell me a little bit of the background of God's. I know some of this is like a family business. The roots of this go back aways. Tell me kind of like how we got to what's essentially like a startup I guess. Yeah, definitely. So the founder of our company is Dave Crinklaw and he started the business back in 1982. He started with his, basically with his dad, was commercial spraying of trees and vineyards. Got to the point where our biggest challenge was labor. Just the shortage of it really. He was forced into innovating and he had...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1664,2022-11-21 23:28:04
19051," Got to the point where our biggest challenge was labor. Just the shortage of it really. He was forced into innovating and he had had this idea for quite some time about doing a driverless sprayer and it finally got to the point where he said, you know what, I either got to get out of this business or I'm going to innovate. Organic or not crops need to be sprayed and this process has to take place a few times a year. This means hiring a lot of people to work long hours under serious pressure. And so, just like the tech bros to the north, Gus decided to solve all of its problems with robots. On this like labor point, you guys have set this up where you can have somebody in a truck and that one person can monitor I think like eight of these. In order to operate Gus, you have one guy or girl that sits in a pickup and they monitor from a laptop computer. So that person is basically just watching all the vehicles on the screen. They can monitor up to eight of them at a time while they're out there spraying an orchard. And so that user interface really provides them with all the information they need to make sure that the machines are safe and that they're doing the correct job. So it tells them what speed they're driving, the engine RPM, the amount of gallonage per acre that they're applying at any given time. So if any one of the machines has an issue, it's going to send an alert to that laptop. Much like a self-driving car, these beasts use GPS, LiDAR, and cameras to see and navigate the world around them. They also rely on pre-built maps of the orchards for extra guidance. Gus builds the machines right here and then takes them out for robot training on this orchard next door. It's here that the company learns if the machines will behave and do as their software and human master's command. So this is kind of like the, this is a test orchard where you guys put it through the paces and work on the technology. Yeah, so this is our test orchard right here. It's right by our building, you can see in the background. So every new machine as it comes off the assembly line, it's put through a commissioning test right here. We test all the sensors on the machine, autonomous computer, all the safety systems, make sure it's doing what it's doing, fire to when it's delivered to a customer. So what's it doing now? So right now he's doing a test spray. So he's just turning the water on to make sure that the system comes up to pressure. Spraying water out of the nozzle is just to make sure it's all functioning properly. Okay. It's got like a crazy turbine at the backer. Yeah, so it's basically just a big fan. Okay. And that fan's driven off of the Cummins diesel motor. And it just basically creates a big air flow. Gus is already selling these vehicles to brave modern farmers. And people the world over have taken notice of its machines. And have you just sold them in the Central Valley or like throughout the US or even overseas or where they go? Yeah, so right now the majority of our machines are here in California in the Central Valley. However, we do have machines and customers in Florida and the citrus industry over there as well as Australia. And I think you start selling them in like December of 2019? Yeah, so we started taking orders early last year for the sprayers and the first delivery we made were in December of 2019. Okay. And how much do they cost each? So our retail price on these machines is $285,000. So it's like it's not a small investment, but I'm sure the regular sprayers aren't. Yeah, I mean we're honestly not too far away from conventional equipment on our price. And the main thing is that the return on investment is very, very quick due to all the labor savings and the increased efficiency. I mean these machines, they just drive. But basically what we're doing besides this machine, this is our first machine we call it orchard Gus. Mainly designed for your nut trees as well as citrus and fruit. In the future we're working on a few other projects. We're going to do more machines. One of them is actually a vineyard sprayer. Okay. Vineyards are much tighter spacing. So the machine has to be physically smaller. And then we've got our eyes on.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1665,2022-11-21 23:32:29

That right there, friends, is a central valley farmer putting his whole fruit basket on the table. Gary's TED Talk can't be far off. And with that, it was time to get back in the RV. And to confront what happens when three men are bested by their own failings and the forces of entropy. Next on Hello World, we cruise into the Mojave Desert in search of a lunar lander. We have instruments that we are going to deliver to the South Pole of the Moon in December 2022, instruments that are trying to scan the surface of the moon. And hang with a test pilot who walked away from this. Meet Betty. She lives by herself, but for the last few months, she hasn't been alone. L.A.Q. Tell me a joke. Did you hear about the claustrophobic astronaut? No. Apparently, he just needed a little space. Most technology isn't made for 93-year-olds, but this woman is making sure that this particular robot is. L.A.Q. Who are you? She's researching the way we interact with machines. And if she has her way, robots will soon be a trusty companion for all of us. My name is L.A.Q. How can I help you? As technology replaces old jobs, it's also creating new ones. I'm Aki Ito, and I'm here to show you the jobs of the future. My name is Danielle Ishak, and I am a human robot interaction researcher. It's really hard to intuitively design a robot meant for a consumer audience. You have to make sure that it's a robot that people want. People know how to use and people value. Danielle works for an Israeli startup called Intuition Robotics. Its US office is here in downtown San Francisco. Hello. Hey Danielle, it's Aki. The company is funded by a couple big names like Samsung and Toyota. Full disclosure, Bloomberg's venture capital arm is an investor too. This is L.A.Q. Can I take her out for a spin? Please? L.A.Q. Tell me what you can do. I am a proactive social robot designed for older adults. I can connect you to your family and friends and even play music. These features might remind you of the Amazon Echo, but you'd be missing the point if you compared her to a smart speaker. She's not meant to just be useful. She's meant to be a companion. And that's why she has a head that cannot make other subtle gestures you might expect from a pet. Through our research with older adults, we're finding that almost...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1666,2022-11-21 23:36:42
19053," That's a head that cannot make other subtle gestures you might expect from a pet. Through our research with older adults, we're finding that almost on a daily basis, we see that somebody tells her that they love her or that they like her or that they miss her. Literally, I love you. They'll also tell her I'm depressed or I'm lonely. They'll open up to her in a way that they might not necessarily open up to a human because they don't feel like they'll be judged. L.E.Q. is an on sale yet. But a prototype is already in the homes of about a dozen early testers who live in the Bay Area. L.E.Q. Tell me what the weather is today. Danielle's job is to figure out what's working and what's not. Sorry. Please rephrase your request. And she does that by visiting each of her testers twice a month. How important are these visits to your job? They're critical. We're building a product for people who we are not. I'm not a senior. And how could you know how to design for somebody if you don't do research? Because otherwise, you would just be designing in the dark. Jobs like Danielle's are just starting to emerge. Until recently, robots were mostly in factories separated from humans. But now, they're finally getting cheap enough, small enough, and smart enough to be in our homes. This has created a whole new challenge of designing robots that people will actually want to interact with. And that's where Danielle comes in. Her research has helped shape every little facet of L.E.Q. From the way L.E.Q moves to the way she talks. It's a very special job, and it could be really hard, and it could be really frustrating about that end of the day. It's incredibly rewarding. And I think the most rewarding part about it is when I see the joy on the user's faces, like the they saw their feedback turned into something real. Today, we've driven east of San Francisco to go see one of Danielle's research participants. L.E.Q. Tell me something interesting. Did you know that Ronald Reagan was a lifeguard in high school and saved 77 people's lives? Now, see, this is where a conversation is. She should open up, and I should say, no, I did not know that. I expect her to be able to continue a conversation for at least a couple of comments. Yeah. And why is that? Why? Because that's companionship. When Betty was around Danielle's age, she was working with some of history's very first computers. When I was finishing up my master's degree, I was working at Harvard in the computer lab when they were building Mark IV. A large room size computer. But now, this artificial intelligence stuff is amazing. L.E.Q. Yes. Schedule a doctor's appointment. No problem. I'm working on it. When Danielle brought along the idea of working with robotics for the elderly, I said, are you kidding me? Will older people connect to a robot? And she said, I don't know, let's research and find out. Danielle grew up here in this suburb of Atlanta. Her parents spent much of their childhoods in Israel and met in the US. We as immigrants, we understood that we might need to work a little harder. In fact, I feel that rather than taking away from Danielle, it gave her so much more. Because she understood the fact that you need to run after your dreams and work really hard.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1667,2022-11-21 23:41:08
19054," Rather than taking away from Danielle, it gave her so much more. Because she understood the fact that you need to run after your dreams and work really hard, no matter what the challenges are. School didn't come easily for Danielle. I have dyslexia and that very much affected my self-esteem academically. The principal of the school did not recommend her to take the Drens classes. She fought for it and she got into it and she did very well with them too. Danielle's first job out of grad school was at X, the secretive research facility founded by Google. It's known for dreaming about kinds of wacky, far-flung ideas. Can you tell us about the moonshot you worked on? No, I can't tell you too much about the projects that I worked on. I can't say that I was working on robotics. She loved the job but wanted to work on something that would reach real consumers sooner. So she left X after a year and joined intuition robotics. She's been working in the field for four years now and it took her a while to find her footing in a male-dominated industry. This is my closet. So at first she did her best to fit in, wearing a pair of glasses she didn't need, and toning down her style. But that got old after a while. Danielle, and what's the kind of thing you were now? No, it's like I just enjoy being kind of expressive and playful and what I wear. Before we wrap up for the day, Danielle has one more LEQ tester to visit. Joseph is 97. And he's had the robot in his home for eight months. How are you? I'm fine, how are you? How has Miss LEQ been? She always tells me to take a drink of water. At least four times a day. So we added a whole bunch of new facts to LEQ. Did you know that a cup of chopped red bell pepper contains more vitamin C than an orange? Okay, what did you think of that? Certainly the print was, I could see that quite clearly. What about this? I can see that. LEQ, play music. No problem. It will begin shortly. By 2050, almost half a billion people are going to be 80 or older. And if current trends continue, more and more are going to be like Joseph and Betty, living alone. LEQ, stop. Today, both of them are doing okay. But some of Danielle's other participants have been struggling. It's a kind of hard to leave them at the end of the day. It is. Some of our testers are pretty advanced in the stages of depression through loneliness and isolation. And at times, I know that LEQ is cheering them up in their day. But I know that it's only part of the way.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1668,2022-11-21 23:45:53
19055," And at times, I know that LQ is cheering them up in their day, but I know that it's only part of the way. No source of artificial intelligence robots will ever be able to replace humans and human companionship for human care. The key to Danielle's work is to embrace that very limitation of machines. Robots should help humans do what they love, help humans interact with more humans, help humans in general, not pull humans away from humans, not take humans jobs, leave humans without purpose. Whether it's in our workplaces or in our homes, robots are soon going to be everywhere. And it's up to Danielle to make sure this robot-filled future leaves us just a little better off. So don't be afraid. And if you are afraid, come and join us. Because I promise it's a friendly place. Here's his work if it's beenートd and Venus. 4% of adults in the US who use YouTube, this might be what your home screen looks like. An algorithmically curated look into what you like to watch. Maybe some tips on how to prepare a new meal or your favorite vloggers latest video. But if you're a parent who shares your phone with your children, it probably looks a little more like this. Kids content on YouTube is huge. Views for videos can reach into the billions. Five of the top 10 videos in all of YouTube's history are either music videos or kids videos, with baby shark having more views than people on the planet. YouTube has created a revolution, not an evolution, in the way kids and families consume video content and that extends then into how they view toys and play and all of the associated things that go with that. Kids YouTube for the unaware can be adorable. It can be boring. It can also just be flat out strange. Here I am, here I am, how to do. But often it involves toys and for toy makers who embrace the platform, it led to record success. I think yellow is the prize. Unquestionably is the biggest phenomenon that has ever happened in touring this street. This is the story of how YouTube changed kids toys. Play patterns, the way children play is timeless. But how we deliver on those play patterns through product and how we market that to children has changed quite a bit over the years. And I would say that the last five to ten years really ranks right up there with the 1950s when TV commercials directed to children this first launched by Mattel. This is Nancy's Wears. She led the Barbie brand during the 90s and spent four years as the chief marketing officer for Spin Master. It used to be that there would be a few play things that parents would bring into the home where that children would create them.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1669,2022-11-21 23:49:58
19056," years as the chief marketing officer for Spin Master. It used to be that there would be a few play things that parents would bring into the home where that children would create themselves like a stick and a ball becomes a play thing. And the industry was at a certain level of volume at that point. Mattel was very innovative and actually put the first product on TV and advertised it to children. Let's play home. This created a huge explosion in the toy industry that unfolded across decades. The hit of the day when you're ready to play, everyone knows it's clean. Here he comes, here he comes, radiate a toy you've ever been and his name is Mr. Machine. Here I go, here I go fighting man for that to go on the land of the TNT air. When you go back to the 1980s, what do you think of in terms of hit shows, you think of things like Masters of the Universe, you think of the original Transformers and Care Bears. The joke was they were 22 minute commercials. Just close your eyes and care. Let's make a TV show which is really promotion for our property or IP to help sell toys. There were a lot of those famous characters in which kids absolutely loved it. They were totally entertained but there were huge toy lines behind them. This is Jim Silver, a 37 year veteran of the toys industry. In 1999 he started a consumer toy review magazine called Toy Wishes and now he's the CEO of an influencer talent management group, TTPM. Regulations changed through the years and also parents became aware that they were purely commercials and you saw a lot of the new channels, the Disney channel and Nickelodeon, they realized that wouldn't work anymore and to them entertainment came before licensing. What happened over time was that toys started to become designed for a 32nd commercial. Close it's a mild amount of toolbox, open it's a micro machine, USA. Cruiser mini micro machine vehicles planes opposed to the police station, the marine of the mini motorcycle repair shop, the gas station, the construction office, work the rear working driver, highway, passenger, rapid garage doors. So if you couldn't explain it in a 32nd commercial, costs reduce it out of the product and just stick with what you could say and features of toys, magical features using electronics, lights and sounds and mechanical movements that magic, they don't know how it happens, that became more and more important. The sound of power is heard. See of that man. That man's turbo powered that mobile flies into high gear. Since 2000 with cable channels dedicated to kids, Disney channel, Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network, there became the opportunity to reach kids in mass numbers every day of the week. And so the toy industries continued to grow. The toy industry for the most part was a pretty solid business, just growing a couple percent a year here and there. There'd be big, big years here and there when there was maybe a hit movie, like a Star Wars movie come out, you know, drive a lot of toy sales. From 2014 to 2019, the global toy industry would grow by 15 percent. At about the same time, those major cable networks of Nickelodeon, Disney channel and Cartoon Network would lose half their total audience. 2017 also saw the bankruptcy of Toys RS, as both parents and kids discovered and bought more toys online. If you think about kids, they're usually the first adopters of a new medium. Kids weren't watching things like Nickelodeon as much as they used to. They were watching things on YouTube. YouTube started in early 2005 and this was like, you know, the very early Web 2.0, this beginning of sort of like what was the time, was the user generated content. Web blogging was really big. My space was the biggest thing on the internet back then. There was an early video of a Brazilian soccer legend doing stunt tricks that just when it exploded on the site, one of the first viral videos, Lazy Sunday, if you remember that SNL short. That's the chronic look, Cousinania! Ow, Charlie! I'm going to be a bit mad. You remember those early?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1670,2022-11-21 23:54:06
19057," Short. That's the chronic lock of Zododia! Ow, Charlie! I'm a dirty bit, man. You remember those earliest viral hits? YouTube in the early days was definitely comedy and music. It was a place of experimentation. I was the chief audience officer at Maker Studios. I oversaw essentially the creator partnerships and all over the world. Maker Studios was one of the largest multi-channel networks on YouTube, and had partnered with some of the biggest YouTube channels of the time, before being sold to Disney in 2014. Chris is now the CEO of PocketWatch, which represents some of the largest kids stars on YouTube, including Ryan's world, and Love Diana, who can amass over a couple billion views every month. The Trude is one of the very biggest and earliest videos on all of YouTube, because by a creator and star named I Justine, where she unboxed her first mobile phone bill for her brand new iPhone, and it came in a box. And this ultimately morphed into many different formats associated with unboxing, and tech was actually really big. And those became fairly successful pretty early on on the platform, and you saw them expand from tech products to beauty products, and then around 2012 and 2013, which was on this explosion in the toys. So here's the Furby inside right here. We used to call them handschannel. And a handschannel was literally a top-down view of someone's hands, unboxing typically a toy. And they'd unbox it, they'd show each component. We just got Uncle Screamy. I would speak to many of those creators. We signed many of those creators at Maker Studios to be our partners. And it was fascinating in that it was this whole new genre, and this whole new format, and that corresponded with a rise of kids and family viewership on YouTube that was stark, that was hard to miss. And you would see it in the data. And we had access to a lot of data in Maker Studios around YouTube. Let's see what's inside. First up, we have the Storm Super Pig. You saw the launch of EvanTube, who I consider the first child, so to speak, unboxing star. And they would open toys, and kids would just mesmerize by it. They loved watching it. And next thing you know, you had literally 50 unboxings. They were unboxed in just about every toy. You know, it was, and people were just really excited. You open the toy, and you see a toy pop out. And kids just got excited, see the piece by piece. Yeah, he's in a bathroom. We're in a, he's eating a lobster. You know, the early days of these unboxing videos, the videos were, you know, from a adult's perspective, just terrible. I mean, they were 10 minutes long. They were boring. It was a shaky camera. There was absolutely no production value. And if you think about these executives, you know, they're trying to figure out how to reach this new audience. And they're brought these videos and say, we'll look at this video. It has 200,000 views on it. And it's terrible. When I first heard of it, I thought it was the weirdest thing. It just seemed kind of bizarre. Who would want to watch someone opening a toy, taking it out of the box? But then when I started thinking about this idea of exploration and discovery as a core play pattern, the most fundamental play pattern there is, it started to make sense. And I think that I have to say that the company that really jumped on that in the most concerted way was MGA with their launch of LOL. LOL Surprise! LOL Surprise had three key elements. A doll play, which is basically the most popular play pattern there is. Collectible. So within each LOL surprise, you'd get a little sheet that showed you all the other dolls you'd collect. And then the surprise factor. You don't know which doll you were getting. It was a blind pack, as they call it. And LOL was made by this company called MGA. Back then, you know, in 2016, they were a small player in the toy industry, founded by this guy named Isaac Larian.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1671,2022-11-21 23:58:32
