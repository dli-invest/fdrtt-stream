17746," They will look at this video. It has 200,000 views on it, and it's terrible. When I first heard of it, I thought it was the weirdest thing. It just seemed kind of bizarre. Who would want to watch someone opening a toy, taking it out of the box? But then when I started thinking about this idea of exploration and discovery as a core play pattern, the most fundamental play pattern there is, it started to make sense. And I think that I have to say that the company that really jumped on that in the most concerted way was MGA with their launch of LOL. Oh, oh, oh, surprise! LOL surprise had three key elements, a doll play, which is basically the most popular play pattern there is collectible. So within each LOL surprise, you'd get a little sheet that showed you all the other dolls you'd collect. And then the surprise factor. You don't know which doll you were getting. It was a blind pack, as they call it. And LOL was made by this company called MGA. Back then, you know, 2016, they were a small player in the toy industry, founded by this guy named Isaac Larian. He's the CEO and founder. I have three adult kids, and they were making fun of me that, oh, you're old, you don't know anything about what's happening in today's sink. And I said, like what? And they said, for example, do you know about this iPhone unboxing videos that get millions and millions of views? I thought they're pulling my leg. Children do to make fun of their parents. And then I did go and look one night. And I was frankly shocked and flabbergasted that, why would you? Why would anybody buy an iPhone? Take it home and open the box and show it on the camera. And everybody can go and watch it. So I typed toy on boxing. And my God, I saw so many different videos and people, kids and adults might toys like an apple and unboxing it and video and posting it. So that gave me an idea that why not come up with the ultimate and that's the first LOL surprise. All right. Oh, yes, we've got a goal, Paul. LOL changed the way you opened with toys. And everybody saw that. And the packaging became part of the play, which became part of the entertainment. So normally, if you get a package that you just open a package you take the toy out, that's not exciting. You open up LOL. You peel it away. You open up inside. You have seven surprises. And it took off like wildfire and quickly became the top toy in the country. By December of 2018, eight of the top 10 toys sold were all LOL surprise brand. And according to MGA from 2016 to 2020, LOL would generate over $10 billion in retail sales worldwide. You know, LOL is bigger than Star Wars. It's bigger than Marvel. It's bigger than Barbie. These brands with huge advertising budgets are known basically by everyone. You don't often figure out when Marble or Star Wars is. And LOL eclipse them all. In the toy world, blind bag or blind box toys have been growing in popularity. The most famous example in recent years is Pokemon cards, where you open packs in hopes of getting a Charizard, but more often wind up with something common like Gligar here. Two years before the launch of LOL in 2014, the Australian toy company Moose Toys launched a blind bag collectible called Shopkins. And in 2016, Spin Master would launch a more expensive blind box toy it called Hatchimals. But the thing that sets LOL surprise apart is that it mainly focused on YouTube. And not putting ads on YouTube, but working with creators and influencers to get their products in the hands of these kids doing the unboxing videos. For MGA, actually, the move towards YouTube was kind of a bit lucky and almost out of necessity. In late 2015, Nickelodeon Parent Company Viacom would sue MGA for breach of contract after it failed to pay $3.5 million for the production of a TV series based on their Lala loop seat dolls. They tried to flex their muscle. And they said, well, if you don't agree to our...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,360,2022-11-18 00:01:53
17747," But he's right now because the formula is so complicated, you have to really take a deep dive into each platform. Am I promoting on Twitter? Am I promoting on Instagram? Am I promoting on TikTok? What am I doing on YouTube? You have to look at every possible social channel. By 2017, big toy brands like Mattel had shifted nearly 50% of their marketing budget to social platform advertising. Brands would help seed videos of their toys. And if they were lucky, that could kick off a wave of creators making their own content around the product. In 2020 alone, tubular labs estimated that LOL-related content had amassed 5.1 billion views. This idea of imitation. So when you see kids playing with product, it kind of excites the same neurons in your brain that happen when you do it yourself. The more we could show children having this experience, the more kids felt what it would be like to have it and then wanted to experience it themselves. One of the criticisms of this whole influencer movement among kids is that kids are young. They don't understand what's necessarily an advertisement versus real content. And that's a big criticism of this industry. Is that a lot of kids are getting on YouTube at young ages not being supervised by their parents and just watching these videos. And they don't realize that maybe that influencer is getting paid by the brand to do that video or there's some other compensation. And that, you know, blurs the lines for kids is they're sort of developing and figuring out how to consume media. Questionable advertising concerns aside, kids YouTube creators would take off. Channels like Ryan's World would grow to almost 30 million subscribers and a whole industry formed around them. When we first started working with influencers, they were very happy to work for free product. You give them the product and they do something for you. And gradually influencers got smarter and started, you know, charging for their services as they started building a following. Now, because it is such a big business, the dollars can be significant investing in big influencers. When Spin Master launched one of its new TV series and associated product, we made it a point to buy an advertising package with Ryan's World to ensure that we could get really quick, big reach right away. This is an advertisement for Spin Master. So from these unboxing videos, the content's gotten a lot more sophisticated. They're creating narratives around the toys, with voices and meta-universes, if you will. And it's really engaging content, even more so than the original unboxing videos for these kids. And, you know, the content's coming out maybe once a week or even daily. So if you think about it, what they've done is they've created basically like a TV show around the toy. It's not unlike what we saw back in the 80s, which was criticized back then, by the way, when you've had toys like GI Joe turn into an animated series, or Masters of the Universe, or Transformers. So we've kind of seen this full circle now, right? So back to where we were, content and basically many television shows create around toys on YouTube. Kids content on YouTube is likely to face increased regulation in the coming years. In 2019, the company would agree on a $170 million settlement with the FTC for serving ads based on personal data to kids on YouTube. YouTube would put more emphasis behind its made-for-kids platform YouTube kids, and each video uploaded to YouTube must be flagged as either made-for-kids or not. In a statement outlining changes to the site, YouTube would say that responsibility is our number one priority at YouTube, and this includes protecting kids and their privacy. Still, the site is far less regulated than traditional television. I do think parents have a better understanding of YouTube now, and the new genres and formats there that they didn't prior, and they now notice things like their kid isn't watching a toy unboxing that's a commercial for a toy. Their kid is watching other kids play with toys in an imaginative way, which inspires them to go play with things in the real world in an imaginative way. In just a few short years, YouTube had caused a transfer of power from toy and networking.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,361,2022-11-18 00:09:52
17748," to go play with things in the real world in an imaginative way. In just a few short years, YouTube had caused a transfer of power from toy and network executives to nine year olds and their families. The Kaji family may have started out as toy reviewers, but now Ryan has launched his own line of toys. A cartoon series. He was even a blimp in the 2020 Macy's Thanksgiving parade. You and I might think about Spider-Man or Snoopy, but today's kids see that blimp of Ryan and they relate to him. He's the character they want to grow up with. He's the character they want to engage with. And as we go forward, these influencers are becoming more and more like big, giant, global brands. He has profound effects for entertainment going forward. AirBnB is huge today. On any given night, you could have as many as two million people staying in an AirBnB all around the world. You know, our mission is that everyone can belong anywhere. We're talking, you know, 300 million stays on any average year and there's tyranny in numbers. The vast majority of AirBnB stays don't result in a safety incident, but sometimes things go wrong. And for AirBnB, you know, we're talking thousands of safety incidents that occur every year that the company has to handle and has to respond to. I'm talking situations like kidnappings, hostage cases. We're talking murder, we're talking rape. We're talking, you know, the worst violent crimes that occur in our society, happen inside AirBnBs. AirBnB never wants these kinds of cases to end up in the headlines. You know, that's really bad for their brand, their reputation and their public image, particularly because this is a business that's based on strangers trusting one another. So when crimes like this occur, that kind of threatens their entire business model. I'm Olivia Carville. I'm a reporter on Bloomberg's technology team and I've been covering online travel companies like AirBnB for the last two years. AirBnB is a startup that's based in Silicon Valley and like many of the sharing economy startups, it managed to grow so big, so fast by essentially skirting regulations. It was based on that premise of move fast and break things and it wanted to work against regulations in order to grow as big as possible and win the popular vote. Because it became so popular, so fast that cities could no longer control it. And a peak night is past August. We had one million people from around the world coming from 180 countries in a single night staying in an AirBnB home. The vast majority of AirBnB stays, we're talking, you know, two million people staying in an AirBnB on any given night don't result in a safety incident. But sometimes things go wrong. And for the company, you know, it was dealing with these cases was a really challenging difficulty.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,362,2022-11-18 00:14:16
17749," go wrong. And for the company, you know, it was dealing with these cases was a really challenging, difficult, complicated area. You had hosts and guests and sometimes they disagreed on what happened. You had regulatory issues in some of their bigger cities. Then you also had, you know, the growth of the platform and the fact that if you're going to try and prevent some of these incidents, it could cut into revenue and cut into the number of listings that you have. So for Airbnb, it was about trying to figure out the best way to handle these crises in a way that's going to not only protect the individual in crisis, but also protect the company's public image, its brand, its reputation, which is essentially what its business is based upon. As Airbnb grew, like way too big for them to be able to take all these calls alone, they developed a team of 100 highly specialised agents that handle the worst of the worst cases. Over the course of my reporting, I've talked to almost 50 former employees at ADIA-BMB and, you know, seven or eight of those work directly on this elite unit. These safety agents, many of them come from military backgrounds or trauma backgrounds. They are trained to handle traumatic situations and to try and, you know, help people who are going through what may be, you know, the worst day in their lives. For these safety agents, a lot of them understood that they had a dual role. First and foremost, they wanted to protect the user in crisis, but they also knew they had a responsibility to protect the company's brand and public image. I mean, everything about housing in New York is a total mess and it's always chaotic. It's not too surprising that Airbnb's biggest battle has broken out here. 2015 was a really challenging year for Airbnb. Airbnb's listings between 2010 and 2014 were essentially illegal hotels. You know, the company was seven years old now. It had grown huge. It was now a household name, but by growing that big that fast, they also came up against, you know, a pushback in regulations. Now, Airbnb's under attack and a lot of media studies. Yeah, so what are they saying about this? They are, well, they can't give up on New York because New York's too important for every kind of reason. They knew that they couldn't lose the battle in New York because it was one of their biggest markets. And also, it could result in a domino effect. If other cities around America saw New York City either backing down on regulations or enforcing strict regulations, that could in turn be rolled out right across the country. I think it's going to be awkward when they have to, you know, put in their perspectives, their risk factors when they have to say, well, you know, one risk is that the whole thing might be somewhat illegal in our biggest market. And in December of that year, a young woman from Australia flew into New York and stayed in an Airbnb with a group of her friends. They picked up a key from the local corner bodega without even needing identification. The police report said this 29-year-old woman left her friends at a midtown bar and returned to the Airbnb on her own. She thought that she was alone, but she wasn't. There was a man inside the apartment hiding in the shadows with a kitchen knife. He grabbed her, dragged her into a room, and raped her. He later fled. About an hour after this attack, he came back and police were in the apartment at the time. They opened his backpack and found three items of interest, the kitchen knife, one of the woman's earrings, and a set of keys to the Airbnb. This case was a really complicated one for Airbnb partly because it occurred in New York City where they were fighting this really tough battle with city officials over regulations, and partly because the alleged rapist had the keys and he was inside the apartment. That meant that Airbnb needed to do what it could to protect itself. They wanted to find out, you know, how did he get the keys? It was a really big question for them.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,363,2022-11-18 00:18:28
17750," That meant that Airbnb needed to do what it could to protect itself. They wanted to find out, you know, how did he get the keys? That was a really big question for them. They launched an investigation to find that out. But before they did anything like that, before they thought to kind of protect their own reputation here, they really focused on doing what they could to help this young woman. They paid for her to move to a hotel. They paid for her mother to fly in from Australia. They paid for both of them to fly home. They offered to cover any health or counselling costs that she might need later. But inside the company internally, they also launched an investigation. They wanted to know how did the alleged rapist get the keys? How did he get inside that Airbnb? And when they found out that the keys had been left at the corner of Odaiga, that then created, you know, a problem of liability for Airbnb. They didn't have a policy around key exchange. They didn't tell their hosts how they did or didn't have to hand keys over to guests as they were arriving. So for Airbnb, they also, you know, they wanted to know what was going to be said in court. They wanted to know if any media were going to pick up on this story. And they wanted to know what their legal liability potentially could be. A week later, the alleged rapist was indicted in the Supreme Court in New York. An Airbnb sent a staff member to find out if the company was going to be mentioned in any of the court records. And it wasn't. It wasn't mentioned in the police report. It wasn't mentioned by prosecutors. There's no mention of Airbnb really in any public record. This case has never been reported until now. And, you know, for Airbnb, that was kind of lucky. This case never landed in the media. And, you know, 18 months later, when this woman's lawyer reached out to the company, they signed a settlement for $7 million. And part of that settlement, there's a clause that says she cannot assert or imply responsibility on the part of the company. We've spoken to legal experts who indicate that what this really did is gag the woman from saying, I blame Airbnb. Airbnb is one of the few companies in the world that has this like online offline kind of hybrid situation, where you have users who meet online and then actually meet in the offline world and stay under the same roof. And that means that the company at the end of the day really has to take more responsibility than other social media platforms might do. With Airbnb's terms of service, that really means that whenever there's a dispute between hosts and guests and the company, this is all handled behind closed doors in arbitration. Most of these cases don't even make it to the courtroom. And when they do, the company will settle them so it doesn't go on through the courts. And what that means is that there hasn't really been a legal precedent that's set to determine what your B&B's liability is here. You know, is it really responsible for when things go wrong inside its listings? What I learned over the course of my reporting is that this is anything but simple. This is a complicated, nuanced area. There are difficult trade-offs here. The company also has to have hard, you know, tough conversations about policy. Airbnb's business model is based on strangers trusting one another. We often hear from the founders and the chief executive himself saying trust is their number one priority. I've actually heard Brian Chesky, the chief executive.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,364,2022-11-18 00:22:47
17751," is trusting one another. We often hear from the founders and the chief executive himself saying trust is their number one priority. I've actually heard Brian Cheske, the chief executive of Airbnb, talking about how he didn't build a website or a platform that allows people to stay in each other's homes, what he built was a community that trusts one another. And when that premise is undercut, Airbnb's entire business model is under threat. It sounds far-fetched at the moment doesn't it? But you know, we may be seeing ads like this in the not-too-distant future. Living away from Earth has always captured our imagination. As well as providing basics for survival, these ideas are a symbol of human kinds' unique creativity and ambition. This advanced beast or a species station would be hit quadrace for the final extent of the moon. Today, the idea of multiple outposts where we can live and work in space has never seen closer. We're going to fly. It's about making our lives the best we can make it. It's about as a species having a path for our future. And the mission to create these habitats is well underway as private companies get ready to take that next giant leap. The International Space Station, it's the only space habitat we have. One of the first places they take you in the ISS is the Kupelah. So you can finally look at the Earth in all its beauty in it. I don't care who you are, it's always stunning, it's shocking, it's amazing because that's the view you've been waiting for your entire life. It passes over 90% of the world's population without most of us ever realizing. And at an estimated cost of $150 billion, it's the most expensive object we've ever built. You think about like the cysteine chapel, the pyramids and the Burj Khalifa or take your pick. I mean, it far outstrips those. It's the one and only non-terrestrial human outposts. We've had a constant human footprint in orbit for almost 20 years because of the International Space Station. The collaboration between 15 countries started construction in 1998 and was pieced together in space over the course of a decade. Since 2000, it's been a permanently crude research laboratory, a space habitat that's allowed human kind to live, manufacture and explore beyond Earth. The overarching achievement of the space station has been education. It has educated us about how to do research, it's educated us about how to live, it's educated us about the harshness of the environment that it is in. And it's about learning, I think. People say what was one of your favorite parts about being up there, hands down, floating everywhere I went. But your first impressions, or ISS certainly is how big it is. The ISS is a size of an American football field. With most of that footprint taken up by eight solar arrays, these provide enough energy to power 40 homes. The station has an American side and a Russian side, as well as contributions from other nations like Canada, Japan and the European Union. Astronauts on board can pass freely between these sections. They're living and working in...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,365,2022-11-18 00:27:16
17752," Astronauts on board can pass freely between these sections. They're living and working areas are made up of modules, each 4.2 metres in diameter, and in total they have the same volume as a Boeing 747. The three main labs, destiny, hope and Columbus, are conducting up to 600 ongoing experiments at any one time. And while it's been a collaboration between governments to build and maintain the ISS, its next chapter will rely more on private enterprise. Today is a very remarkable day. NASA is opening the International Space Station to commercial opportunities and marketing these opportunities as we've never done before. Managing and maintaining the ISS costs $3.4 billion a year. That's over half NASA's Space Operations budget. Aging hardware and space debris will only add to these costs, which is why NASA is now hoping to pass some responsibility for the station over to commercial companies. We would like to see a robust commercial marketplace in low-earth orbit where space stations exist outside of NASA, the goal being that NASA could be a customer and we want to have numerous providers that are competing against each other on cost and innovation. Keep your rent and... With federal funding proposed to stop in 2025, opening the station to private enterprise would free up resources for the space agency's ambitions to return to the moon and journey to Mars. Transparent to a more commercial model is allowing industry to take over many of those areas that NASA has traditionally been responsible for, like the design and operations and maintenance of space systems. But the most exciting part, I think, is new opportunities. The iPhones would have never come from the government, for instance. The base technology came from the government but the way it's used, the way it interacts with consumers, governments aren't really built for that. So I think that'll be exciting to see how private industry uses the same technology or the same systems but then use them in a different way. Every NASA achievement has been the collaborative achievement of NASA and industry. What's going on right now that's a little bit different is NASA is turning to companies not to direct them what to do but it's turning to companies to build relationships with them because those companies are attracting investment from non-space sources and are bringing a different kind of innovation to the table. In the shadow of NASA's sprawling Johnson Space Center, the headquarters of startup Axiom Space might seem a little modest but their goal is big to build the first commercial space station. Led by a former ISS program manager, the team has been involved in every mission to the station since its inception. We know it has to be much lower cost operate on orbit than ISS is today. So this is key to continuing the heritage of ISS. It's to start there so we can evolve everybody to the next platform. I liken this to the internet. So the internet was created and we got very excited. And any kid with a good idea and just the basic programming skills could go build a program to do something. We have huge companies to grew out of that and still today there's new ideas, new things being built. The thing about a microgravity environment is it's limitless. It's like the data we have access to on the internet is limitless and it is not immediately obvious to us all the benefits that that's going to entail. But over time it will become very, very obvious. By 2024, Axiom plans to send a central node to attach to the ISS. That will make up the core of their new station. This will be followed by crew quarters for 16 people and research and manufacturing modules. When the ISS is retired, this will break away. An additional modules with a lifespan of 30 years will be added and swapped out as they age using a robotic arm. And they're hoping to do all of this for 150th, the cost of the ISS. I mean when you talk about our vision, it sounds really simple. It really is about driving the thought process and the cost down so that anybody that wants to take advantage of our place in orbit and a microgravity environment can do so. That's really it. Okay, Ellen, I need to go towards my feet. The international space.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,366,2022-11-18 00:31:40
17753," You saw it, and that's really it. Okay, Ellen, I need to go towards my feet. The International Space Station is a fantastic vehicle, but one of the big things is they have a quite a few major components outside, which means you have to do an EVA a spacewalk to go fix it. A spacewalk on a good day is 100 hours of crew time to get ready and actually go do the spacewalk. So we're able to take advantage of the reduced size of components, and so our design is gonna have all of the components are gonna be in the pressurized environment. So we know what the basics are, you know, water, food, clothing, life support, and we know how to handle those. But now the next step is how do we make it more intuitive? And we want to now take advantage of the technologies and the capabilities have today to build more luxury into the experience. The objective is to make the environment the background for all the users. You're everyday doing whatever you want to do on orbit, research, manufacturing, looking out the window, whatever you're there to do, we want you to be able to do that not even think about the environment. And it's because of our experience on ISS and what the team brings to the Axiom space, we're able to build that environment. You won't worry about that. Three, two, one, release, release. Fire, fire. Like Virgin, the Latin, Tick and Blue Origin, Axiom is hoping to attract space tourists with tickets starting at $55 million for a 10-day mission. But that's just one part of the commercial space station market that they think could be worth $37 billion over the next decade. Our first commercial customers are countries who have astronauts in space and want to expand their activity in space. And countries who do not yet have a human space flight program who want to send people up. And we've now got both research and manufacturing companies who want to do work with us while we're at the International Space Station and on our platform after it separates from ISS. Human space flight is particularly exciting because it's that slice of space that is really nested. It hasn't undergone the crowding that satellites have had. It hasn't already had that explosive growth. It's really ready for that now. The first thing I'm really looking forward to seeing happen is the face of our first astronaut on orbit looking back down on us and knowing that we had a hand in sending that person to space. And ultimately, the separation of ISS when it's ready to be retired and de-orbited and then we continue in space independently. For me, that is a stepping-off moment for humanity. It's almost like when Neil Armstrong put that first boot on the moon. This will be the first time that we've gone from a platform of learning how to live in space to building our permanent home in space. Other private companies also want to use the ISS. As the starting point for their own ventures, Bigelow Aerospace already has one of its inflatable structures attached to the station. And others, including Sierra Nevada and Nanorax, have put forward proposals. Space habitats are expensive. I think it's a false dichotomy to say, OK, we're done with the International Space Station. Let's move on to commercial platforms. What I think is much more likely and realistic in what NASA is certainly driving toward is an incremental transition where commercial platforms attach to the space station or work collaboratively with the space station. The next chapter cannot occur without the active engagement of companies. That said, that active engagement might not be as customers might not be as drivers. It might be in service of government mission objectives. We will return American astronauts to the moon, not only to leave behind footprints and flags, but to build the foundation we need to send Americans to Mars and beyond. This proposed mission, along with SpaceX's own ambition to reach a red planet, has opened up a longer-term market. And some companies are already thinking beyond orbiting habitats like space stations to actually building on the surface of other planets. I was working in a firm designing skyscrapers, and I saw Elon and he landed his Falcon X rock in the middle of the ocean, and that for me was a trigger. I thought, wow, this could actually happen. And it's always been my dream to put a building on the moon or Mars. And if he's going at the pace he's going, it could definitely happen.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,367,2022-11-18 00:36:08
17754," I thought, wow, this could actually happen. And it's always been my dream to put a building on the moon or Mars. And if he's going at the pace he's going, it could definitely happen within my lifetime. And I want to be the one to build it. In this warehouse, alongside startups from across the US, architecture firm AI Space Factory are refining the production of Marsha. A four-story structure, they created for a NASA competition to design the next generation of space habitats on Mars. When we started designing our Mars habitat, Marsha, I think we looked at everything that had been done already and tossed that aside. But what we were given was a set of guidelines from NASA. They think the best way to build a habitat on Mars or the moon is to use what they call in-situ resource utilization. So use the materials that are there. If you've seen sci-fi movies, you might see glass and steel domes on distant planets, but the reality is to ship that kind of material to the moon or Mars would be so absorbed in the expense of you and never be able to build in the first place. So the idea is to send a 3D printing robot, which can then harvest the materials you find on a site and build with that. The reusable print material is a mix of biopolymer, made from recycled plastic or plants like corn and sugar cane and basalt, a rock found on Mars and Earth. It's the rock that gives us its incredible strength. We've tested this material. It's three times as strong as concrete in compression and it actually has what we call a tensile capacity and prevent itself from being pulled apart, which is something concrete is not very good at. You need to think at all times how do you optimize the amount of material that you use. And that's also why this thing is shaped like an egg. And if you think of an egg, it's a very structurally optimized form. It's very, very thin, but it provides the strength that the egg needs and that's why this is shaped the way that it is. The egg shape, as well as a nested shell structure, also accommodates for extreme differences in pressure and temperature on the surface of Mars. But more research still needs to be done to find out how print materials could be gathered and how 3D printing would work in a unique environment of space. You're dealing with a completely different set of physics and environments, which is very harsh. The cold, the low gravity, the vacuum of space, and finding solutions for how to build their or do anything in space just requires a high degree of innovation. There's no such thing as brute force when it comes to space. Like you need to think about the problem, find a very elegant, lightweight, cost-effective solution. The next challenge is really going to places on Earth, literally taking the dirt that we're finding on a site and beginning to print with the dirt. We have to perfect this technology on Earth, and then we go prove it out on the moon, and then finally onto Mars. The first customers could include NASA and companies like SpaceX who would lease out these structures for individual missions. But before that, AI space factory hope their technology could be monetized as well as transformational here on Earth. The challenges of building on Mars forced us to kind of make this jump in construction technology, which we can now apply on Earth, to build more sustainably. So rather than building with steel and concrete, which are these manufactured, very energy intensive materials, to go to a site, have a solar-powered array that would then allow our 3D printer to print in the most sustainable way possible. And we never would have found these ways that wasn't for the challenge of building in space. Three, two, one, ignition and lift off of the Falcon 9 to the space station on the first commercial launch from Kennedy Space Centers, historic at 39A. Humans have now been consistently living and working in space for more than 15 years. And if we want to keep that up, what do habitats need to look like? And frankly, they can be larger, they can be small. But the future of space habitats really, to me, comes down to the ability to persistently maintain human presence. Whether that's a few people or many people, that seems to be the dividing line between where we were before and where we want to be in the future.

We have to learn how to benefit from what we do on orbit and bring those natural benefits back home so we help ourselves out on the ground while we also learn to live somewhere else. And it really at the very deepest level is about survival or species. So I get pretty excited when I spend a few moments thinking about what we're off to go do because this really is the first step to learning to live off the planet. That first step is just the start of our journey to create a lasting legacy in space. While commercial companies may be stepping in to imagine what these new space habitats look like it's what's happening inside of them that may unlock the future of space industrialisation. On the next episode of Giant Leap we'll visit the private companies who are looking to build their business around manufacturing in space. Using the unique properties of microgravity they plan to create new materials with extraordinary qualities that can't be replicated on Earth, including new manufacturing techniques that could change how we build large structures in space and even unlock the ability to 3D print full human organs. But before low earth orbit can become a new industrial centre we're going to need to take another giant leap. This is how it used to work. A real estate agent would lock in the client, they'd stage the place, hold an open house every single weekend and hope that the right buyer walks through that door. 10 years ago you could probably go look at a house and circle back two to three weeks later and still have an opportunity to make a bid. The first time I received a lead through Instagram my mind was blown. If you're seeing something in a neighbourhood that is established you have two to three days after the open house in this market to make it offer. Our world that shifts so much folks are getting comfortable doing business either through social media or 100% virtual. Social media like everything else it touches has turned the real estate business upside down. You've heard this trope before, millennials aren't buying and owning as much as their parents' generation, be it a car, a diamond or a home. But the lack of ownership is not always by choice. In 2018 a survey found that 89% of millennial Americans want to buy a home. They just can't afford it. As of 2019 millennials of all stripes owned only 5% of US housing compared with 15% for gen Xers. Millennials haven't been able to make these big ticket purchases the same way as their predecessors did. Now this is down to the financial crisis we have rising student loan debt and a higher cost of living. Now millennials are getting older, they're earning more money and saving more. So now is about the time where a lot of them are going out and making those purchases. And now having been stuck at home for over a year the same generation that embraced Ubers and Airbnb's wants something to call their own.

17756," I didn't have a child, so you know, looking for more space and thought about the conventional route of young and single and living the city and then move out to the suburbs We have a kid and a wife. I've seen a whole bunch of my friends just move on down to the west Palm Beach my amy area Austin, Texas so they are certainly moving out of the city but space was top of mind for them moving out We lived in Williamsburg for about 16 plus years and week two in the pandemic we just realized we needed more So we started looking for a house right away. We now live in Gosha, New York, which is about an hour and a half from New York City Instagram accounts like circus houses and cheap old houses offer a glimpse into the perfect suburban life Often at a price point not too dissimilar to what adults pay for rent in major cities by the end of 2020 New Yorkers who didn't flee paid an average of $2,700 a month for an apartment even as rent prices plummeted during the pandemic Millennials make a large percentage of spending right now and that makes them a valuable consumer for brands That means they're being courted by everyone out there to spend with them They grew up online. They're comfortable with pretty much anything that you can do there And that's that's buying things selling things Craigslist, eBay all that Making a $100 purchase on Craigslist or a $1000 purchase on eBay It's not that much of a leap to go even further if you're buying a fancy piece of jewelry or a house for a million bucks The uptick in home demand fueled by the pandemic combined with record low interest rates has made home buying Extremely competitive over the last year so much so that some millennials look to social media to shop and actually buy their first house site unseen I saw sort of something on my Instagram feed and You know clicked and we ended up seeing this house House is weren't really being shown at that time because we were in full lockdown. We became really interested in one YouTube video 20 Z-LO photos that is it The red-hot housing market spells opportunities for developers targeting this demographic getting eyeballs strictly through social media People are not looking in the the back section of the times anymore for for real estate listings our demographic is between late 20s to mid 40s and that demographic is spending a lot of time on social media And they're doing a lot of shopping via Instagram and other social media platforms This is Joshua Gelb and Pepe hamburger During the pandemic the two New York City-based developers started Neville House a new construction project two hours north of the city I'm like most traditional real estate listings the pair bypass the use of a broker and advertise their homes directly on Instagram No fees no commissions You used to have to hire a broker work with them. They would do showing on site now you basically put your renderings on On Instagram and within an hour you have 15-20 replies saying can I come see it directly with you and let's see it tomorrow And it's just completely changed the game most people have that image in their head of the a quit-essential upstate modern cabin set in the woods We've definitely tried to tap into that and create something that's attainable for these people say you can have that You can be swiping through Instagram and that can be your home too There's been quite a proliferation of these direct to consumer brands There's just tons of them out there. It's not that hard to start up a website That's that sells things and get things manufactured For that e-commerce platform. So like all birds with shoes Casper with mattresses or warby Parker with glasses all of that means a lot more opportunity for brands in the online shopping space So it's natural that real estate would want to get involved as well with these big ticket items Ten years ago the broker would drive the search now I think that my clients text me listings. They have alerts They find things quicker than we do sometimes because we're out and about I'd say that the buyer is much more involved these days Social selling is creating brand new ways to shop.

17757," Vintage clothing, for example. There are sellers on Instagram finding successful ways to sell one of a kind items. It's that fleeting nature, the ephemeral nature of social media. You post the item online and whoever's first gets that one of a kind item. Now real estate has similar scarcity to it. There's one place to buy. It's one home, one apartment, one one thing. It's one of a kind. But the rise in social media real estate isn't just about the instant gratification. Researcher Andre Perry, who studies economic inclusion at the Brookings Institute, says social media has evolved from the days of online hangout spaces and mood boards to a powerful change agent. Social media is a primary source to get news and information, but it's not just about social media. It's about the movement that we're in. The racial justice uprising really gave people a sense of worth and empowerment. And so people not only are getting information about what protects people in the long run from economic shocks, things like wealth. In his research, Andre found that not only are more millennials buying homes during the pandemic, the rate of home ownership among black millennials are at historic highs. The fastest way to accumulate wealth in this country traditionally has been through home ownership. Millennials in particular are saying, hey, I want protection. I want to live longer. I want my education to go further. Let me acquire wealth and the fastest way to do that is through home ownership. When the pandemic hit many of the amenities or the comforts that came along with those living conditions were gone. Folks couldn't go to bars and fancy shops. And so you saw instead of people going out and buying clothes, they saved their money and bought property and outside of the city generally. People are moving to the suburbs, to rural areas, places where home prices are a little bit cheaper. Many home buyers are looking for houses outside the major metropolitan areas. Additionally, many home buyers are looking for direct outdoor access and added space as the uncertainty about the virus persists. Millennials are also looking to influencers not just for the latest trends and TikTok dances, but to partake in important conversations, be it about politics or personal finance or anything in between. Real estate ownership. Let's start small. Let's don't be scared to start small instead instead of renting a big house in the hills in California like most artists do by you on this on the flat. I meet folks like Brandon Rullin, Charlemagne the God. You have residential real estate and you have commercial real estate. They're talking about buying homes. When I was coming out, really home buying was a mysterious, shrouded process that only a few people could teach me. Now I can easily log on to Clubhouse or Instagram and find literally lessons on how to purchase a home, but done with savvy and finesse. Today we're going to make a greenhouse. I am DIY-ing the entire closet. Heather, having bought her fixer upper sight on scene, also looked to internet personalities to help figure out how to modernize and to make sure her home was also an investment. It gave us a lot of confidence. They make it look super easy. How we could do all of those things ourselves. My husband just installed a laundry shoe which is something we never would have thought of if we didn't see an influencer do that and how easy it actually is. Really simple to do it yourself project. You can do that. You have any questions. Go ahead and message me. And in the case of Neville House, Josh and Paley hope that buyers see these homes as potential secondary income. These young families look at these products or look at our homes and say here's a turnkey. This can serve our family but this can also be the perfect rental. We've tried to strike a balance in the design of the home for working well as a family home. That's going to be lived in and also working as an investment. A lot of this is points to how millennials can utilize and leverage social media to their benefit. But it also speaks to again this moment that folks want freedom.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,371,2022-11-18 00:53:16
17758," utilize and leverage social media to their benefit. But it also speaks to again this moment that folks want freedom. So millennials are really stepping up to this real estate game and taking ownership and building well. Of course not everything is as it seems online. While social media can be a useful tool for learning, there's still a lot it can't tell you about the home buying experience or living in the suburbs for that matter. We knew going into it budgeting for a lot of renovations. We kind of thought if we buy it at $450, we could put $300,000 into the house and really make it ours and our own. I can't wait to replace in this kitchen and update our built-in deep fryer which was not in the listing photos. We kind of got into the house and we realized that budget was completely unrealistic. We have a lot of people who see our design on Instagram and they say I love it, can you come build this on my property? And then they'll send us the lot which they bought site unseen during COVID and because of site conditions or zoning it's virtually unbuildable. I think we all know that what you see on Instagram and what you see in real life are two very different things. So while we can definitely as brokers create these fantastic narratives, the one recommendation that I would give is do your homework, don't believe everything you say. That's not to say that you know there's dishonesty or anything where people are trying to manipulate you but not everything you see is accurate. This shift towards social media house hunting may also help to bring equilibrium to a market that has historically disadvantaged specific groups of buyers. Many of the traditional ways that people got mortgages or loans often precluded black people because they deemed us too risky for those loans. With technology there's ways to get around that. As long as more black people get educated on racism and discrimination and lending we're going to figure out ways to get around that racism. When I was 24 years old I saw the UFC on a paper view on TV and I was so overwhelmed by the athleticism, the skill and then at the end of the fight the combatants hugged they shook hands and I just fell in love with it. Part of UFC's appeal is it doesn't look like a ballad athletic display of martial talent and mastery as much as it looks like a bar fight. We choose to do this because we love this work but it is a business and if you do not treat it like a business I guarantee you that the promoter is and you will be left broken, broken at the end of your career. Each of us have an individual story but as with anything you take enough of these individual stories and you see not only crossover but intersectionality.

17759," Take enough of these individual stories and you see not only crossover but intersectionality. A group of former UFC fighters that are suing the UFC scored a key legal victory on Thursday when a federal judge said he would grant their lawsuit class action status. There have been fights in every major US sport about workers' power in the labor market. I don't think there's a guy in the sport from the guy who just got his first fight all the way up to the Conor McGregor's that is pleased with the way the UFC treats fighters. The way we've been strong armed, the way we've been coerced. Fights over unionization in some sports, fights over free agency in baseball, and in boxing, the Muhammad Ali Act, which restricts the kinds of contract terms that can be imposed on boxers. The fighters who brought this lawsuit see it as the continuation of a tradition in sports, of athletes fighting to have agency and power in the terms of their work and who they do it for. Mixed Martial Arts used to be pretty culturally and legally fringe in the United States. It was banned by most states. John McCain had famously called it human cock fighting. There are some rules in the UFC, but to a large extent all sorts of body parts and tactics and attacks are on the table. And people get seriously injured at times. My nose has been broken multiple times. I had my right pectoral torn off, how to get that reattached. I've had my jaw broken, the two places, I've had my neck broken. I had my left ankle broken, how to get that repaired. I've had a torn right laborer in my shoulder. He broke my eyeball, I mean the bone that holds up my eyeball. I've had my left eye orbital fracture, twice where my eye caved in. I was swallowing my own blood, I knew, don't blow your nose or both eyes of the world. At the time that UFC was bought for just $2 million by the former boxing coach, Dana White, and a casino owner. He'd been friends with Lorenzo Fertita and his brother Frank Fertita. UFC was struggling as were other mixed martial arts promoters. It was pretty much a fixer-upper, the money that they spent to actually purchase it for $2 million was much less than the money they quickly had to sink into it in order to revitalize it. They've hold off a multi-pronged strategy that was quite successful. First, they did what White has referred to as running towards regulation. They found ways to make compromises with state regulators so that the sport would not be illegal. And at the same time, they also popularized it. They made gambles like paying the production costs themselves for the first season of a reality TV show, The Ultimate Fighter on Spike TV. It's all over! It is all over! The label's sent just ends! The Ultimate Fighter! UFC, under Dana White, had a gift for weaving, compelling personal narratives and rivalry, people throwing shoes, a guy coming to the octagon with who let the dogs out playing while he was dragging another guy on a leash. My first contract with the UFC is kind of an interesting story because here I am on this reality show The Ultimate Fighter. And they started to realize how big of a stepping stone this was going to be for the UFC. It's at us all down individually, put a contract in front of us and said, hey, we realized that this is going to be huge and we really want to have you all a part of it. The UFC Family movie is forward, so we want to go ahead and get this out of the way, just sign this simple contract and we'll be able to move forward as one unit. But as I'm looking at this thick contract and wondering what I should do, Dana White looks at me and says, don't worry, this thing takes off, we'll take care of you. The fighters would say, at the heart of...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,373,2022-11-18 01:01:58
17760," They know why it looks at me and says, don't worry, this thing takes off, we'll take care of you. The fighters would say at the heart of UFC's power is the contracts that it signs with fighters. Before boxing had competition boxing used to be dominated by a few dominant promoters, and the contracts were ported over from boxing. And the contracts are basically designed to control every aspect of a fighter's career. They're long-term. They last multiple fights. Fighters under these contracts are bound to fight only for UFC for a period of time. And UFC can extend that time if a fighter declines a match or if a fighter gets injured. They control who the fighter fights, they control when the fighter fights, and then they have a number of different clauses that make it very difficult for a fighter to ever break free from UFC if that fighter ever did want to become a creation. Contracts are so one-sided, there really is no negotiation room for any of the things, especially as you're coming up and as their stranglehold on the sport of MMA got so much stronger. Part of what's at the heart of this lawsuit is the ways that UFC successfully took other competitors off the board. The UFC had such a stranglehold on mixed martial arts and as they were buying up so much of the competition shutting them all down, they really became the only option for anybody that wanted to do this professionally. If you follow Dana White's Twitter or watch him on YouTube, you could have seen Dana White calling himself the Grim Reaper and bragging about how he has defeated or derailed or acquired one after another company that tried to compete with the UFC. In 2011, UFC acquired Strike Force, which at the time was the most prominent rival still standing. The CEO of Strike Force Scott Koker has said in the past that he saw himself like Luke Skywalker up against the Death Star trying to compete with UFC. Eventually, when Strike Force was bought out by UFC, my only option was go to UFC because they had the rest of my contract. Now I'm under a contract where it's only an 18 month contract with six fights, but five years later, I'm still stuck in the contract. The month before UFC's parent company Zufa completed its acquisition of Strike Force, a UFC executive sent an email and the subject line of that email was we own MMA. And the UFC has admitted in documents that have now become public that they've almost never lost a fighter that they wanted to keep. In internal UFC emails, we now know the company referred to what it was doing as choking off oxygen to the competition. The most important oxygen that UFC allegedly ran a foul of the law by cutting off to its competitors is the fighters themselves. And not only did they make it clear to us, they made it clear to the whole mixed martial arts world, there is no negotiating. These are very strict, never-ending contests.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,374,2022-11-18 01:06:14
17761," World, there is no negotiating. These are very strict, never-ending contracts, and that's the case for this day. The UFC just says, oh, you want to fight for us, you sign here. If you don't want to, we've got 20 other guys that will take your spot. They have 70, 80, 90 percent of the top fighters under exclusive contract, meaning that those fighters are not available to any other MMA promoter. And fighters, even if they wiggled their way out of the very restrictive contract that UFC imposed on them, didn't have another professional mixed martial arts option because there weren't robust rivals to go sell their work to. On Tuesday afternoon, a class action lawsuit was filed in US Dispray Court in San Jose against Zufa LLC with fighters Kung Lee, Nate Quarry, and John Fitch attached to the suit. Rampe Jassin came to me and says, hey, Kung, I know this lawyer, he will help get the fairness for the fighters in the marketplace. And I decided I wanted to step up for all the fighters that being affected. At the end of 2014, more than six years ago now, a group of now-all former fighters filed anti-trust class action lawsuit against UFC. And in broad terms, the case is an antitrust case where we're claiming that the UFC is both a monopoly and a monopsony. Usually when we talk about monopoly, we're talking about the power that a company has when it becomes the only one selling something. Monopsony is about the power of being a monopoly purchaser of something, and particularly a monopoly purchaser of labor. A key argument in this lawsuit has been about as UFC succeeds in its revenue sores, how much should we expect that absent illegal conduct, the fighters pay would soar as well. In UFC, year after year, the share of the company's revenue that goes to actually paying the workers doing the fighting has hovered around or below 20%. And what this analysis shows through complex statistical regression modeling is that if the UFC was competitive and did not allegedly violate the antitrust laws, it would pay its fighters 50% or more of the revenues is generated just like baseball, just like hockey, just like basketball, boxing. If instead of paying 20% of the revenues generated, it paid 50% or more of the revenues generated and the fighters would have made $1.6 billion more during the period that we measured 2010 to 2017. Sometimes when you write about allegations against companies and particularly about lawsuits against companies, those companies don't want to say a whole lot about them or are pretty dismissive of the significance of litigation against them. UFC in their comments to me has been pretty feisty about this, saying that they see this lawsuit actually as a threat to the ability of businesses to take risks and succeed, and that they don't want to roll over, that they want to fight it and they want to defeat it. The fighters I talk to describe having side jobs, being reliant on UFC in part because after taxes and expenses, they weren't making enough money to feel financially secure. The overview of my career from a financial perspective is something that had a challenge in admitting, I can tell you now that I lived with my mom's attached to a rock the entire time I was fighting and I had a second job as a bouncer and a bartender, a third job as a personal trainer just to make ends meet. Nate Quarry told me that over his time in UFC, he fought fights while he was tens of thousands of dollars in debt coming into the fight. It gets so disheartening because I've seen fights that are called the fight of the year. This is just this brutal war.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,375,2022-11-18 01:10:43
17762," into the fight. It gets so disheartening because I've seen fights that are called the fight of the year. This is just this brutal war and they battled for four and a half rounds until one guy's body just gave up and then you find out, oh that guy made $60,000 for that fight. In one of the hearings in this lawsuit, UFC's attorney argued that if the fighters were really the product, if all that UFC were selling were the fighters, then the fighters wouldn't need UFC at all. That a fighter is not themselves the UFC product any more than an Apple engineer who makes a cool iPhone is the product that Apple is selling. We the fighters make this whole thing happen and it's been driven by Chuck Ladell. It's been driven by Reyna Kittor. It's been driven by Conor McGregor. It's been driven by Brock Lesnar. It's been driven by all the greats that have walked before us and that walk this path right now. We are the product. If the fighters are not the product, then go ahead and release this from our contracts. You'll do fine without us, clearly. It's the identity and rank and popularity of those fighters that attract the eyeballs and make the sport what it is. And if you can lock all those up and keep them from other promotions, you can dominate the sport, which is what they've admitted they've done. William Isaacson, a lawyer for UFC, said in a statement that UFC has spent many years building a world-class organization, enhancing the brand of our athletes, and championing the sport of MMA. UFC pays its fighters more than any other MMA promoter with average fighter compensation rising by over 600% since 2005. Our efforts have raised the global popularity of the sport and the overall revenue potential of all MMA organizations and athletes. In December of 2020, the judge announced a crucial step in this lawsuit, which is that he is going to certify it as a class action. Class certification makes this lawsuit a much more significant threat to UFC, and the judge made clear long before saying how he planned to rule that he expected whatever he did to be appealed into federal appeals court and on from there to the US Supreme Court. So we are likely in for many more months and years of wrangling over this. Kyle Pingesbury said that he doesn't think any settlement would be acceptable unless it includes a change to the restrictive contracts that UFC uses to keep fighters bound to the UFC. My son is about to turn six years old and it started when he was in the womb. We're in this thing to the end to change the sport forever. We want the same freedoms that are offered in any other major sport and we're, every other major sport has gone through what we're going through right now. We'll tell fighters, you know, just shut up, look at how lucky you are. Well no, actually we're fighting for what we believe in. We're going to continue being fighters and that's how we how we're made.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,376,2022-11-18 01:15:17
17763," Every nation that's a coastal state has some region of the sea floor that falls within their territorial waters and many countries including the US, the area that's underwater exceeds the area that's above water. So huge amounts of nations, areas and regions are just really unexplored, uncharacterized. We don't really know what's there. We know less about our sea bed than we do about the surface of the Moon or Mars. Only 20% of it has been mapped. A map of the sea floor could lead to all kinds of discoveries like numerous species and rare earth minerals like cobalt that we need for electric cars and mobile phones. The value of all the gold deposits are loan on the sea floor is estimated to be around $150 trillion. A map could also help us when tragedy strikes. Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 disappeared from radar screens. The mapping of the ocean floor is being carried out. The problem is that the southern Indian Ocean is just so incredibly huge. To me, a map is a fundamental piece of understanding of who we are, where we are, where things are. Once you understand something, you start to value it more. When you start to value something, that's when you start to really think about making it healthy and preserving it and keeping it going. A map is the first step. It's the basic understanding that you need to figure out where you are. Oceans. They cover over 70% of the planet, but most of what lies underneath is a mystery. The sea floor is a really fascinating landscape. We don't have a lot of data to describe the shape of it in detail, but in places where we do, there are spectacular features. There's meandering channels with all kinds of interesting topography, there are canyons, there are sea mounts, mid ocean ridges, all kinds of things that we see on land that are just basically hidden from us by the water. As it stands, this is what a map of the sea bed looks like. All that black? Those are the parts we haven't mapped yet. At present, most people think that the sea floor is actually mapped because you'll see a world ocean map and you can see some shape of the sea floor, but most of that is based on prediction. Roughly 80% of what you see for the world ocean floor is modeled based on measurements of the sea surface height and a computation based on gravity. In 2017, the Nippon Foundation and the General Barthometric Chart of the Oceans, or Jebco, launched SeaBed 2030. It's a collaborative project to collect and collate data oceanwide and create a complete map of the sea floor by the end of the decade. To do this would take one ship around 350 years at a cost of up to $3 billion. That's why data is harvested by all kinds of vessels from fishing boats to freighters. Because there is so little data, it's important that vessels that are capable and willing to acquire data when they're just moving around the ocean do so. So we have a lot of data that's collected during transit. There's a lot of academic requirements to make data publicly available. There's industry data that's starting to become more and more available. There's government data. So there's a lot of different ways that this data is coming in and it's a really messy and challenging puzzle that put together. But what's exciting is that it's a puzzle that put together. Since SeaBed 2030 launched, the area map has risen to 20%, and all the information collected is freely available. The more data we have collectively and other people can access, the faster the discoveries are made, which really pushes forward our understanding at a faster rate than if you held onto that data and it was only you with that data. Things like machine learning and artificial intelligence are also going to kick in in the next decade. As with all this data, they'll be able to make connections.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,377,2022-11-18 01:19:22
17764," Things like machine learning and artificial intelligence are also going to kick in in the next decade. Because with all this data they'll be able to make connections that are a lot faster than perhaps we would have been able to. Which then again feeds our human understanding and also gives us new ideas, new ways of thinking, and of exploration. Until the early 20th century mapping technology was simple, usually a weight attached to a long rope known as a lead line. After the Titanic sank in 1912, explorers proposed using sound waves to find its hull in the North Atlantic. This led to Sonar, the most common technique used for mapping today. Operated by the Schmidt Ocean Institute, the Falcourt is an 82 meter long research vessel equipped with two multi beam Sonar systems that have helped Deborah Smith and a team of other marine technicians to map over a million square kilometers of the sea floor. You know you go from somebody with a rope with some knots to sonar acoustics that is, I call it, math magic. But it is incredibly advanced mathematical technology to be able to measure the distance and time of travel of sound on a moving ship. Multi beam mapping works by using sonars. So sonar is taking sound and measurement of time. So you have a multi beam sonar and it sends out a ping of sound. That sound travels through the water column, hits the sea floor and comes back to the ship. And we measure that time and we're able to calculate the distance. Each individual ping of sound has many, many beams. So it looks like a giant fan across the sea floor and that fan is moving along the sea floor. So you have many tiny little beams going across and they're traveling along a track. You can look at that data and look at both the peaks and the valleys and the highs and the lows and sort of create a three dimensional image of the sea floor. The accuracy of multi beam sonar really depends on the water depth that you're in. Think of it like a flashlight beam and if you're holding a flashlight and you're shining it on the floor, the closer you get to the floor with your flashlight, the smaller that beam is. If you have 400 of these beams all across, I think of 400 people holding a flashlight. The closer they hold that flashlight to the sea floor, the smaller your beam is, which also means the smaller that you can find information or data about. So it really depends on the depth of the sea floor in order to see how much you can define an object. This variation in depth means that mapping resolution will range from 100 by 100 meters in shallow waters to 800 by 800 meters in the deepest parts of the ocean, which go down as far as 11,000 meters. Remotely operated vehicles or ROVs can then be sent down to investigate sea bed features up close. We've just crossed the 1000 meter mark. It's 4.6 degrees C and now we're going to drive the ROV down at a high rate towards the sea floor. On a recent mapping expedition, scientists on the Falcon discovered a 500 meter tall coral structure in Australia's Great Barrier Reef. The first to be discovered in over 120 years. A place that is incredibly popular, well-visited, well-traveled, you know, we're still finding new things. You don't know until you map it. And so until you get that sort of high resolution picture, you don't know the sand waves or the old river beds that used to be there, or the waterfalls off the side of a volcano that used to be above the surface and now is below the surface. It's a little bit of everything. Think of let's say Hawaii or someplace where you see a volcano above the water. Picture that below the water. I'm really kind of obsessed with the whole concept of scale here. Although we can create 3D models and, you know, kind of come up with these visualizations, it's not the same as that feeling of looking out over this big landscape. I mean, I think we'll get there soon with VR and other kinds of technology, but it's really spectacular to think about, especially with the familiarity that some of us have with these features, like what it looks like. We look out at the ocean and it just looks flat, maybe with little bumps. We really don't think about all of this that's underneath and it's really an amazing landscape that's just hidden from us.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,378,2022-11-18 01:23:44
17765," Maybe the little bumps. We really don't think about all of this that's underneath. And it's really an amazing landscape that's just hidden from us. With more than 90% of the ocean deeper than 200 meters, fleets of autonomous vehicles could make the data gathering process faster, cheaper and safer. And new discoveries might help with exploration of all kinds. I think the ocean can actually provide us with huge incidences. We go out into space as well and look for life and other kinds of life forms. I also think in this next few years, we will have a different kind of access to the ocean because of virtual reality and augmented reality. And so that will allow us to sit in our living rooms and really experience what's under water in a different way and see this different alien planet. Since the dawn of man, meat has been on the menu. And even with growing trends of vegetarian diets and plant-based substitutes, around 89% of the world population consider themselves omnivores. We have come a long way from our hunter and gatherer roads. We have managed to establish a whole industry designed to feed almost 7.7 billion people. We've maximized production and we managed to reduce the cost of the food. And although we've become exceedingly efficient at putting meat on the table, raising livestock animals by the billions comes with its own set of consequences. If animal agriculture continues to expand the way it has, there is a race that we won't be able to stop climate change. But with rapid advances in technology, we might soon see a food industry that leaves all those problems behind. I am Bade to be one of the world's first commercial customers for lab-grown meat cultured meat. It's a very, very exciting meat. Here is the chicken. It looks pretty crispy outside. It's really good. I mean, look, it's really tasty. Here at 1880 in Singapore, Colt, the most popular meat in the world. It's really good. I mean, look, it's really tasty. Here at 1880 in Singapore, culture chicken is being served under a regulatory approval granted by the Singaporean government. It's the very first time a cultured meat product, meat made from animal cells grown in a lab, has been approved for commercial sale. Eat just the company behind these chicken nuggets style dishes is based out of San Francisco and got their start in 2011 developing plant-based egg substitutes like mung bean scrambled eggs and mayonnaise. But it wasn't until 2017 that they announced they were shifting focus to a cultured meat product. In order to feed the world that we live in, a lot of animal protein, we need to take a third today and it'll be more tomorrow of our world and make it dedicated to feeding chickens and cats. We go to areas.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,379,2022-11-18 01:28:29
17766," animal protein, we need to take a third today and it'll be more tomorrow of our world and make it dedicated to feeding chickens and cows. We go to areas that are filled with biodiversity rainforests, taking a bulldozer to them and planting soine corn to feed the chickens that we climate change is accelerated by the kind of animal production that we engage in. When we bring animals in tiny little spaces, it accelerates the probability that more zoonotic diseases are going to impact our families and from a morality perspective, why do we need to cause any harm to any other living thing to have dinner that tastes good? It does not have to be that way and those things underlie the force of this idea. The meat alternatives that have made it to the market thus far have been plant-based, imitation beef and pork made from ingredients like pea protein and coconut oil by companies like Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods. That's a very different proposition from cultured meat which is made from actual animal cells. I'm a huge fan of any company of any person trying to make a product that's improving the food system, including all the plant-based proteins. Maybe in some future menu you'll have this kind of cultivated chicken and you also have a plant-based version. That's fine. But I guess you have to ask yourself in our lifetime, is that diner likely to also remove the conventional option on the menu too? We do think we need a more permanent solution. We do think we certainly need, if you will, an in-game to this problem and we just think this is more likely to be the path to achieve that. So animal cell technology has been around for several decades for applications such as development of vaccines and other biotherapeutics. The first known prototype of cultured meat was done by Mark Posts earlier in 2011 and essentially he was developing beef patty. It was a very expensive prototype. If I'm not mistaken above 250,000 euros at the time to produce just one beef patty, it was more of a group of concepts to really demonstrate that this technology is possible and that it can be done. The way that we grow and produce culture chicken is essentially a weak isolate chicken cells from the chickens without having to kill them. So from a small biopsy for instance, we immerse these cells in a liquid broth that contains the nutrients that the cells need to survive and be healthy and to grow. We really need these cells to multiply to reach the numbers that are sufficient to make a meat product. We're looking into the cells that are really important for meat. So we think about muscle cells, fat cells, by the isolation, we are able to form those muscle tissues in culture. The culture happens inside of a fermentation tank, what we call the bioreactor, which is essentially providing the same conditions as the animal body. Warm temperatures, some sort of mechanical stimulation, so that the cells that are exposed to a very similar conditions that they have inside of the animal. After the cells proliferate and reach a certain density, the final step is essentially to separate those cells from the liquid broth that they are in. We just make sure that the product needs our quality and safety standards and then those cells are ready for consumption. Milk, cheese, yogurt, a lot of those derived from fermentation conditions. The only difference is that they are starting from a different cell type. In this case, we're just using the animal cells as the initial and beginning of the product. Each just has developed chicken nuggets so far with far more textured chicken breast plan for the future. But another cell-based meat startup Memphis Meets has already started working on culturing other animal cells as well. We've done beef, we've done duck, we've done chicken, and these are things that are favorites in various parts of the world. For instance, people in America love beef and chicken. People in China love duck, so we wanted to show that we at Memphis Meets can produce meats that we as a global population love to eat. There's a lot of similarity on how we grow the meat.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,380,2022-11-18 01:32:23
17767," I not love duck, so we wanted to show that we at Memphis Meets can produce meats that we as a global population love to eat. There's a lot of similarity on how we grow the meats from various animals or fish, but they're also different because of nutrients they need and how they actually come together to form the final product of meat. And I think it's very similar to how we also grow various animals. There's similarities in the feed that we gave cows and pigs and chickens, but there's also differences how we cultivate and it's very similar for us as well. So we've been working with the FDA and the USDA for the last three years and really developing the guidelines on how this food should be regulated when we come to the market. As soon as we get regulatory approval in the United States, people will be able to go to the supermarket and buy it and enjoy it. They'll be able to go to a restaurant near them and order meat directly from animal cells. But it's not just getting the meat right. Once approved, the gates open to a very high potential demand and scaling becomes the next big hurdle. Before we can only make chicken for myself, my friends, my girlfriend, my family, my colleagues, now we actually have the ability to make chicken for millions of people. So that allows us to invest and to allow the economies to scale to drop the price. The second is we need to reduce the cost of the nutrients that these cells are consuming. So I think chicken feed raises or drops a price of chicken. The nutrients we feed ourselves does the same things. We need to drive that down. The cell density is another technical element. We need to continue to increase that and hammering on those things. So of the course of the next five, 10, 15 years, we'll put us in a place where we're significantly below the cost of this animal protein. And that will be one of the main inflection points that we'll lead to a new way of eating meat. So here is a close-up of a half-eaten crispy chicken bite. You know what? What I'm really thinking is, just I'm eating chicken. I like chicken. You know, the normal chickens eat, I don't know where they came from. And so I don't know why I should be very stressed where this came from either. The meat market is worth more than $1 trillion annually, and there are over 60 startups in the cultured meat field. Cultured meat has attracted several prominent investors, including Sergi Brin, Richard Branson, and Bill Gates. What is also interesting is that even meat giants such as Cargill and Tyson have invested in space. It's this destructive potential of the market, as well as the promise to greatly reduce the climate impact of meat production that has attracted investors. It remains to be seen who will get regulatory approval in which countries, and whether consumers will like lab-groom meat enough to make the switch. And while there's no evidence that lab-groom meat is any less healthy than traditional meat, there's an ongoing debate over how healthy eating meat is in general. But if these products are a success, they could be the beginning of a more humane, less destructive meat industry. The food and ag industry is the most innovative industry in the world. It's always figured out how to feed a growing population, and we've never failed doing so. And it's been very clear to us that we are part of that, and we're going to figure out how to feed the next three billion people joining us. And I just see an evolution. We can do this a bit differently. We can do this in a way that is consistent with the kind of people that we want to be, the kind of planet that we all want to live in. We can build a food system that reflects really the best characteristics of who we are. And that makes me really helpful.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,381,2022-11-18 01:36:57
17768," INTRO Impossible foods might be the world's most ambitious company. listen to founder and CEO Pat Brown. People wonder how big the plant-based meat industry is going to be. It will be the meat industry in 20 years. We're going to look back and basically say, well, remember back in the day when we used to use animals to make meat? Yes, impossible-stated gold really is to replace the use of animals as a food production technology globally by 2035. That would mean supplanting a 1.2 trillion dollar industry not to mention a source of sustenance as old as time. To be fair, the company has got a lot of people talking about its products. So there's this thing called the Impossible Burger. What's called artificial meat, the realest fake-est burger in the world. Not bad. But before impossible foods can take over the world, it's going to have to overcome strong competitors, penetrate tough new markets, and generally transform its product from a conversation piece into a ubiquitous staple food. With the coronavirus turning the world of food upside down, this could be the moment when Impossible's new fangled meat goes mainstream. Impossible foods was founded in 2011 when Pat Brown, a longtime vegan, was nearing the end of an accomplished career in biochemistry. I've been astounded to my whole life and just came to this realization that by far the most important scientific question in the world is, what makes meat delicious? Pat Brown, someone called a zealot for his mission. He really doesn't hold back when it comes to talking about wanting to completely replace animal agriculture. Producing meat from animals is the most destructive technology on Earth, and if we're going to overt catastrophic climate change, we have to find a better way to produce meat. You've probably heard about the dangers of cow flatulence. Their digestive systems produce large quantities of the powerful greenhouse gas, methane. In fact, it's estimated that livestock farming is responsible for nearly 15% of all greenhouse gas emissions. In Impossible claims, it takes 89% less GHGs, 87% less water, and 96% less land to produce its burger. The key, of course, would be to get people to actually eat the thing, which is where the company's secret ingredient comes in. Him, a genetically engineered substance with a bloody iron-rich taste like red meat. So heme is a very controversial part of the Impossible burger. It's also what makes the Impossible burger what it is. There are a lot of consumer groups and anti-GMO groups that oppose the Impossible burger because of the heme. The studies on its safety are pretty short-term, but the FDA has approved it, and the company says it's completely safe, and there isn't any evidence that it isn't. Critics have also challenged the company's claim to health advantages over traditional meat, pointing out that while the Impossible burger has less fat, sodium, and calories than its beefy cousin, it's also more highly processed. But let's be real. We're talking about mimicking hamburgers here, not kale salads. These burgers are definitely better for the environment, so that's a plus, but they're not necessarily better for your health. The years in the lab, Patton's colleagues were confident they had a product even Ron's sponsor could love, and the Impossible burger made its debut in 2016. Their burger began its life in the public when it was sold at a David Chainspon with Fuku. And they went from sort of higher-end, fine dining restaurants into higher-end burger restaurants like Bare Burger and Mommy Burger. And then suddenly they started popping up everywhere. It tastes like a burger.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,382,2022-11-18 01:41:19
17769," into higher-end burger restaurants, like Bare Burger and Mommy Burger. And then suddenly they started popping up everywhere. It tastes like a burger. It tastes like meat. This is all meat from plants. All meat from plants. This tastes like beef. Doesn't it just look like real meat? So meat-like. They always say it's what they say. It's just like a burger. It tastes like yuckers. Meat foam is the world's relics. Yeah, it doesn't taste like a burger. Opinions differed on the impossible burger's relative meatiness. But the debate itself was fantastic free advertising, helping to propel impossible into major chains like white castle. And then in the summer of 2019, into more than 7,000 burger kings across the US. To date, the company has raised over a billion dollars and a funding round in March valued the company at around four billion. But fake meat is a happening space these days and impossible faces some daunting competition. So I'm now for the stock of the hour. And that is Beyond Meat shares of the faux meat or plant-based protein company are soaring today. Beyond Meat is also making a very meaty burger from plants. They're very non-GMO. They stress that all the time to differentiate themselves from impossible. It'll be much easier to genetically modify plant material to make it take on the texture and appearance and aroma of animal protein. But we won't do that. Beyond Meat had one of the biggest IPOs of the year in 2019. So impossible, which is still privately held, has some catching up to do. But you won't hear Pat Brown knocking his biggest competitor. I wish them nothing but success. They have the same mission we have. The only rival we care about is the incumbent animal-based industry. Rivals or not, impossible and beyond certainly agree on one thing. The true prize isn't the American market. It's China. 27% of the world's meat is consumed in China compared to just 9% in the US. The Chinese population eats a ton of meat. They are a huge market. China is a really interesting case because they have long had vegetarian cuisine as part of their culinary culture. And whether they are looking for meat replacements is still an open question. What we found in our reporting is that some consumers are excited about them. It's just, we don't know if it's going to be enough. To improve its prospects, impossible is developing a plant-based replacement for pork. Globally pork is the most widely consumed meat. It's almost 40% of all the meat consumed globally. Number one in Europe, number one in China. So if we're going to achieve our mission, pork is right up there. No word yet on when Impossible Pork will be available. This morning, growing concerns about the nation's food supply. From butchers to national supermarkets, supplies now limited and prices rising. The impact of the coronavirus on the price and availability of meat has given a boost to companies like Impossible Foods. Over the four weeks ending April 19, sales of plant-based meat increased. But Impossible has acknowledged some negative effects from the pandemic as well. This being a product that has primarily been served in restaurants, they took a pretty big hit with all the food service shutdowns, although the company doesn't want to say, you know, how much of a hit. They have, however, announced some new retail rollouts. Recently, they announced that they're going to be rolling out with crogror supermarkets. And that's big. That's great for them. The question of whether this is like a long-term sea change for these companies. I don't know. Just have to wait and see. It's safe to say Impossible stands a slim chance of achieving its goal of replacing the entire meat industry. But it's early days for the science of plant-based meat and it's not impossible that these products could one day contribute to a greener, more humane future. In the meantime, as the technology improves, we get to look forward to many more.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,383,2022-11-18 01:45:21
17770," This is the most possible that these products could one day contribute to a greener, more humane future. In the meantime, as the technology improves, we get to look forward to many more years of this. This is meat. No, this isn't possible. Yeah, that's what I thought. This is the meat burger. I like it better. It's not even close to a veggie burger or a tofu burger or anything. Without that, very, very much. What are, is a strategically important point on the map of Pakistan. It sits very close to Iran, actually, on the very southern coast. It's about a 10-hour drive west of Karachi, but it's only about an hour drive to Iran. The area is extremely poor. It's very arid. It doesn't have enough water. Electricity has been a very spotty. One of the most surprising things about visiting Guadar is the high degree of security that is absolutely everywhere. There are armed guards that are required to escort foreign visitors everywhere you go, because it is contested in the region, because there have been militant attacks in the past. Despite all this, Guadar is a key part of the China-Pakistan economic corridor, also known as CPEC. The Crown Jewel of President Xi Jinping's Belt and Road Initiative. We will leave no stone unturned in ensuring that CPEC and all the projects under its umbrella are materialised in time and in full. So far, just one-third of all CPEC projects have been completed. In Guadar, none of them have been, and the promised improvements for local people like job creation and better infrastructure have not materialised. So what has China got to gain from developing this seemingly obscure city on the Pakistani coast? We have seen this movie before. An outside power comes into Pakistan. It spends heavily on big infrastructure projects. China is not the first to do it. Right after Pakistan became independent in the late 1940s, early 50s, the US was sending advisers into Pakistan to help plant economy. The US was doing infrastructure projects there too. Those early projects helped the US gain Pakistan as an ally against the Soviet Union during the Cold War. The US has provided about $80 billion in aid to Pakistan since its independence, but overall the result is disappointing. One of the recent attempts was in the late 2000s, as part of the US effort to combat terrorism in Afghanistan. The number one item on that aid package was to build these high visibility infrastructure projects. So there are literally projects that the United States tried to do or Pakistan proposed to the United States in the 2000s during that period that have become Belt and Road projects. China is stepping into a gap which has been left by retreating ambition from the US. A generation of US-made vehicles is preparing for the development of the United States. The Belt and Road Initiative is China's President Xi Jinping's signature foreign policy initiative. Launched in 2013, it comprises an overland belt stretching through China Central Asia into Europe and a maritime road stretching around Southeast Asia through the Indian Ocean and up past East Africa.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,384,2022-11-18 01:49:33
17771," and a maritime road stretching around Southeast Asia through the India Ocean and up past East Africa. So a benign way of characterizing China's Belt and Road Initiative would be infrastructure for influence. So when Xi Jinping announced the Belt and Road Initiative, shortly afterwards China designated Pakistan as its showcase flagship project. So the China Pakistan Economic Quarter was going to be the biggest and most important showcase for the success of the Belt and Road. Pakistan is in great need of infrastructure development. They wanted to create a railway, a highway road, all kinds of economic development that is intended to help Pakistan and it's meant to provide jobs, 2.3 million jobs for Pakistanis. It's meant to provide a 2.5% boost to GDP growth. And China would gain economically as well. CPEC was intended to reduce oil and gas routes from the Middle East by thousands of miles, a way to cut overland into Western China instead of going around Southeast Asia by ship. Projects in Pakistan also provide Chinese state-owned companies with an additional market. Chinese workers have brought to Pakistan to build infrastructure and then take wages home. CPEC is also strategically significant for China and Pakistan. China wants to strengthen this relationship to counter their shared rival India. CPEC is both an instrument of Chinese power as well as a test of Chinese power. If it succeeds, China will be demonstrating that it's able to do what great powers have not been able to do in Pakistan, including the United States. Which is why Guadar is so important. It's in Pakistan's Bologna-Stan Province, an area with serious electricity and water shortages. Bologna-Stan Province is actually populated by people who are of Bologna-Stan origin. There are different ethnicity. They speak a different language from the majority in power in Islamabad. And they feel as the poorest province in Pakistan, they have not sufficiently benefited from some of the economic achievements that the rest of Pakistan has had. That area is quite contested by the Bologna-Stan Liberation Army. The people who feel that even Pakistani people have encroached into their territory. So quite a number of people are still staging attacks and they attacked the biggest international hotel in Guadar. Shot up the lobby and killed I think five people. But this unsettled city is where the China-Pakistan economic corridor is supposed to lead to. Authorities plan to develop Guadar into an international port city. Guadar Port has an interesting history and an interesting location too. It's located in Bologna-Stan. It's about 120 kilometers from Iran. Pakistan purchased this territory from Oman, I think of the 1950s. And so for a long time, Pakistan has had on its agenda trying to develop this area. Since the 70s, it's wanted to build a port in Guadar, actually approached the United States in the 1970s and tried to convince the Nixon administration to pay for a port, even offered naval access if the United States was willing to pay for that. The US rejected Pakistan's offer, concerned that the port would not be commercially viable and would cause geopolitical tension. But in the early 2000s, a Chinese company was awarded the contract to build the port and they completed phase one of construction in 2006. The port was then managed by a Singaporean government entity. In 2013, a Chinese port operator took over from the Singaporeans. In 2015, China announced that it will expand the port as part of the CPEC initiative, but five years later, little has happened. When you look out at the port, you can see it has only three births and all of them were empty. And the only ship that was in the port at the time was a Pakistan naval forget. And so it indicated to me that the port is not particularly operational for commercial purposes and a number of analysts have talked about.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,385,2022-11-18 01:54:01
17772," And so it indicated to me that the port is not particularly operational for commercial purposes, and a number of analysts have talked about the strategic importance in a military sense, if eventually China were able to use the port of Guadar as a military base. You know, no one would be surprised if China did use it in that way. I don't think in the short term, like it is set up in Djibouti, where it has a permanent base. I think it's more likely to use it as almost like a sort of forward base to resupply option. Something it can use when it wants to. Other projects like building Pakistan's largest airport in Guadar and two special economic zones have been delayed. A 19 kilometer highway linking the port with the Macarankostal Highway in Balochistan is under construction too. Most of the people who live there and work there already are fishermen. They rely on access to the sea. The way that the highway, express highway from the port was originally proposed, would have cut off their sea access. And so that was a a real point of contention with the community. There have been some proposals to allow them at underpass. It's still a little bit unclear how that is finally going to be resolved. Even if those projects are eventually built, there are serious questions about who will work there. There is a problem with manpower, of course, in Guadar. It's a very small city. And so one proposal has been well, we'll just ship Chinese workers in from China and build lots of fancy housing for them. The first Chinese built community in Pakistan, a 500 million dollar development spanning over 10 million square feet with over 60 percent open spaces. That kind of proposal is what makes a lot of the Pakistani local people quite upset. A Guadal-based journalist expressed concerns to Bloomberg over projects like this. The journalists spoke anonymously for fear of persecution from the Pakistan government. These projects are creating jobs, but they're not really creating jobs for the local people of Guadal. They're not against economic prosperity, but they're against the development that leaves them behind. Pakistan doesn't have the money to build these projects. It's gone to the IMF for its 13th bailout since the 1980s. By engaging in CPEC projects, the government of Pakistan has incurred more debts from China. Not only posing challenges for Pakistan, but possibly the international community if Pakistan eventually defaults on its debts. But CPEC is still set to go on. Even if most current projects haven't been completed, the two countries have recently signed new projects worth $11 billion. Pakistan's Prime Minister said the country's economic future is linked with China. It's hard to imagine how the China-Pakistan economic quarter is going to be the game changer that the Pakistan government would like it to be. We're not seeing the economic growth or benefit from the projects that were set out and were supposed to have seen by now. We're not seeing the job creation. Project delays, accumulating debts, commercial viability. These problems of CPEC are also typical of Belt and Road projects around the world. For China though, it's never the narrow accounting perspective that matters. It's the bigger strategic benefits. As China's dollars continue to flow as China's concrete continues to pour, China's influence continues to increase.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,386,2022-11-18 01:58:24
17773," There was some degree of runaway expectations. I think there was also some degree that they weren't extremely forthcoming with the state of the game. The Cyberpunk 2077 story is very much kind of a story of everything that can and will go rock in game development. The release of Cyberpunk 2077 in December of 2020 will go down as one of the most disastrous game launches in history, and it instantly rewrote the narrative of its celebrated developer CD Projekt Red. Larger studios with bigger budgets weren't able to create the same quality of open-world game. The inside story of the making of Cyberpunk depicts a process marred by unchecked ambition, unrealistic timelines, and a focus on marketing and the expensive development. When CD Projekt Stock was at its high, it was the largest stock in the Polish stock market. Cyberpunk was supposed to be the biggest game of 2020. This was a game that was starring Keanu Reeves. This is a game that was from the makers of the Witcher 3. This was supposed to be the big temple release of last year, and for it to become such a disaster for so many people, I think, will have pretty far-reaching consequences. CD Projekt Origins are somewhat unique in the game's industry. In the West and Japan, the late 80s and 90s were dominated by games through the home console market, and characters like Mario and Sonic the Hedgehog were becoming household names. The same was not true in a post-Soviet and economically depressed Poland. Most games were done on PCs, and most games were copied and sold in small markets around the country. You could go to the market down the street in Warsaw and buy in cell CDs, and these two guys, Marchiniewinsky and Michal Kaczynski, decided they were going to start selling CDs, and they wound up striking a deal with the people who made a game called Baldur's Gate, which was the seminal role-playing game in the late 90s. CD Projekt, named for selling CDs, would move on from just reselling games to localizing Western and Japanese made games into the Polish language, but it wasn't until 2002 that the company would make its own game, The Witcher. The Witcher is a huge, huge series, huge fantasy series in Poland, and so it was a pretty big deal that these guys got the race to make the video games. The Witcher Book Series is a source of national pride in Poland, and a CD Projekt released The Witcher 2. The video game series would become an important economic symbol for Poland as well. CD Projekt Greta had become this behemoth of an institution in Poland, and they were really big in the Polish technology scene because they were getting more worldwide attention than most Polish companies do, and making a lot of money. And in 2011, when Barack Obama came to visit Poland, the Prime Minister actually gave him a copy of The Witcher 2. I confess I'm not very good at video games, but I've been told that it is a great example of Poland's place in the new global economy. But it would be The Launch of The Witcher 3 in 2015 that would elevate CD Projekt Red from representing the best of Poland to representing the best of the game's industry.

17774," I mean really the thing people look for first and foremost I think is that the game is just good and Witcher 3 was just a phenomenal game. There's a level of just storytelling and emphasis on making every side quest count on top of the atmosphere, the dialogue, the character interactions, the different way stories can end. They nail that. Other open world games felt empty and forced and the developers of them gave excuses as to why there couldn't be more rich story or interactions and the Witcher 3 blew them out of the water. CD Projekt Red was beloved. They were seen as a studio that was willing to make what the player wanted and to truly put in the love and effort required to make a high quality game that really connects with the people playing with it. And the winner for Game of the Year 2015 is The Witcher 3. The Witcher 3 would go into an over 250 game of the year awards, but along with being a critical success for CD Projekt it was also a financial success. Estimates put the sales of Witcher 3 at around 28 million copies in 2019. A huge step up, considering by 2014 the Witcher and the Witcher 2 had only combined to sell 8 million copies. And with two large expansions for The Witcher 3, CD Projekt also helped separate themselves from other AAA publishers at the time. And the game award goes, oh man, I have to pay a micro transaction to unlock. That's so stupid that this has to hold on. I got this guys. Here we go. The Witcher games and the most notorious one to do this was EA's Star Wars Battle Front 2. They got really aggressive on micro transactions in a game that already cost at least $60. You could have paid more if you bought the premium editions, but not only was it that they were being very aggressive and trying to get you to spend money, but you could actually get items that helped you win. So gamers kind of draw the line in the sand there, and they don't like them. CD Projekt had done this phenomenal job of marketing themselves as a gamer-friendly company. We've said this a million times, and I'll say it again, we're gamers first of all, and we all like to be treated fairly. So it only makes sense that as developers, we apply the same principle to everything we do here at CD Projekt Red. So giving everyone a bunch of free DLC was an absolutely no brainer. They said, we're not going to sell you DLC that's like horse armor packs and other nonsense. We're going to just give you free stuff, and then we're going to sell big expansions as part of the Witcher 3. And not only were they really good, they were offered at a fair price. And this is a company that was seen as just like a company that really cared about quality and cared about its customers, and would not do anything to kind of screw fans over the way that fans see that EA and Activision and all the other big publishers do. With a critically and financially successful game, as well as the goodwill from the gaming audience, all the focus would shift to CD Projekt's next release, Cyberpunk 2077. It's actually funny, they first announced it through like a press release. And then they showed off a trailer of the beginning of 2013 that was like the CGI trailer of like a woman and there was also some cool cyberpunk stuff flying cars lots of stuff.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,388,2022-11-18 02:07:01
17775," And then they showed off a trailer of the beginning of 2013 that was like the CGI trailer of like a woman And there was also two cool cyberpunk stuff flying cars lots of stuff, but It wasn't really until after the Witcher 3 the cyberpunk began really like building up this fever level of hype CD Predic Red though wouldn't put out another trailer for cyberpunk until 2018 at the E3 trade show and they showed off a It was like a two-minute trailer of cyberpunk look pretty rad And then they showed behind the scenes for E3 attendees for press and anyone else who could get a score an appointment in there They showed this 45-minute demo and it blew people away Welcome to the gameplay demo walkthrough of CD Project Red's upcoming title cyberpunk 2077 The gameplay you're about to see is from a work in progress version of the game everything you see is potentially subject to tune Holy This if they can live up to what they showed me It's game over It all looked incredibly impressive They had enough action enough narrative beats with just the right amount of tension They touted how each of these NPCs there are thousands of them each one with their own daily routines and everything We've greatly enhanced our crowd and community system to create the most believable city in any open world game So yeah, so People were certainly blown away by this demo at 23 awards and just people left the theater just in awe What they didn't know of course is that the demo was completely fake Fake demos are common at E3 studios put together builds of games to show off what they intend the game to be like rather than the actual state of the game What was unique about this demo was that it was impressively long It kind of plays into this idea that CD projects is very much a marketing driven company and so demos were really really important to them So it was really important that they make the demo blow people away, which it did But that might have come at the cost of like some time they could have been spending on the game a year later at E3 2019 Fans would get another big surprise of being there of walking the streets of the future is really going to be breathtaking You're a breathtaking The cyberpunk trailers showed gorgeous cities beautiful lighting Really cutting edge technology when it comes to the rendering of the game itself People were very excited to be immersed in this gorgeous cyberpunk world They saw over 8 million pre-orders, which is a ridiculously large amount for any title to sell let alone pre-sell And you saw the stock price start to go up and up and up and up into the right You know pretty pretty much in a straight line if you just look at like the Polish stock market like the wig index when CD project stock was at a tie it was the largest stock in the in the in the index and that was around the time That they announced that the game would be coming in April of 2020 behind the Seaheens people were pretty shocked that they were saying April I don't think a single person who worked on that game actually thought they had a chance of coming out in April of 2020 So in April of 2019 I published an article for Kotaku about the making of a game called Anthem Which is a game from Bywa that was disastrous in many ways and the article kind of ran through why that was And afterwards they started hearing from other developers who had Stories to share that they said sounded a whole lot like Anthem the deadline is unrealistic The direction keeps changing things are floundering we're going through a lot of problems This sounds exactly like what you wrote about Anthem around that same time Perhaps go incidentally",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,389,2022-11-18 02:11:22
17776," Changing things are floundering, we're going through a lot of problems. This sounds exactly like what you wrote about Anthem. Around that same time, perhaps coincidentally, I heard from the CEO of CD Projekt Red who wanted to reach out to me specifically to talk about Crunch. CD Projekt Red had a reputation for Crunch, especially during the development of Witcher 3. Their management wanted them to have a reputation for treating workers well and not forcing them to go through Crunch. So, Marchinevinsky, who's a co-founder and co-CEO of CD Projekt Red, came to me and said, hey, I want to make a vow right now that we're not going to force anybody to Crunch, that people will not have to work mandatory over time on this project. Over the course of reporting, Bloomberg has conducted interviews with more than 20 current and former CD Projekt staff, most of whom requested anonymity, so as not to risk their careers. CD Projekt declined a comment on the process, or provide interviews with this story. The company would end up delaying the game three different times, first pushing from an April 2020 release to September, then November, and once again to December 2020. In order to meet the deadline, the studio would scale down the size of Cyberpunk's main city, as well as canceling some features, and while those measures helped, developers still said they were under significant crunch, including one former audio programmer who claimed to work up to 13 hours a day, five days a week, and stating he had seen friends with lost their families over this. This was not a big secret in the office that the game was not going to be ready, but a similar sort of thing happened with The Witcher 3, and a similar sort of thing happens with a lot of games where they don't seem ready until suddenly everything just clicks. Some of the best games ever made, like we're created through this process. I don't know that it's the most efficient or the wisest way to make video games, but it's what a lot of people do. I think that management there has genuinely tried to change it, or at least said they wanted to change it, but it has proven very difficult to change that when you make games in this one specific way. Game studios, some of them see crunch as part of their core culture, that all of their games that they've made under crunch have been successful, so it must be a core element to the magic recipe for creating good games. And that's really not the case. We've run studies and seen that at eight weeks of working 60 hours plus, the output of a professional is the same as if they were working 40 hours a week. So chronic overwork degrades how effective someone is to the point where then it becomes negative, and overworking them is just getting less and less productivity. And so these guys, the People at CD Projekt, having made the Witcher 3, we're kind of riding on that high, you could call it arrogance or confidence, or whenever you want to call it, of having made the Witcher 3. And I think that like having a certain level confidence can certainly be a good thing, but in this case it could also be dangerous because it kind of blinded them to the reality, which was that this game wasn't going to call us. So many pictures entertainment is reeling from what may be the biggest in modes devastating computer hacking in Hollywood's history. Hackers attacked in waves, first crippling Sony's internal systems, then leaking five Sony movies online. Today the US government pointed the finger of blame directly at North Korea for the devastating cyber attack against Sony pictures.

17777," Sony Pictures. Sony pulling the plug on the interview, saying it will not show the controversial comedy about an assassination attempt on North Korea's leader. The Sony Pictures hacking was taken very seriously because it was an attack on the free world. What we have been building in terms of our civilization and our freedom and our ability to exchange information freely have been disrupted by a country that we knew very little about. North Korea has reportedly made attempts to steal COVID-19 vaccine technology by hacking from the Citicle Giant Pfizer. The Justice Department has charged three North Korean hackers over a wide ranging scheme that included the attempt theft of billions of dollars for multiple companies. Despite so many attacks blamed on North Korea, there was not much known about the people behind the hacking attacks. And my aim was to reveal who these people are and what they are like, what their operations are like, and on what their dreams and fears were. My name is Sam Kim. I'm a reporter for Blue MIRN News. When I wrote a story for Business Week about North Korean hackers, my story is about people who are sent from North Korea to countries like China to hack for the regime, spy on enemies, and make money. North Korea's cyber abilities began about in the 1970s with a lot of students going to countries like Russia, China, and even East Germany to learn coding, it was aimed at improving the productivity of factories at home. But in some time in the 1980s and 1990s, the current leader Kim Jong-un's father, Kim Jong-un, thought that it would be a good idea to develop a team, an army of people who could hack for North Korea's military. So they began this team of hackers who would spy for the North Korean regime and also go out there and make hard currency for the regime. I think Kim Jong-un takes the hacking ability more seriously than his father. He also enjoys a bit of tech sadness as well. He's often shown traveling on his airplane where on the desk there's a Mac computer. He understands the importance of computers, he understands the importance of employing technology to improve productivity of his economy. North Korea is an isolated country with its economy pretty much dilapidated nowadays. It's been under increasing pressure and sanctions from the US and the international community basically. It does not have the resources and money to build a kind of conventional weapons that other countries are able to build. So what happens is North Korea concentrates its resources on building nuclear arms and missiles which exports coal basically a symmetric of weapons. It's the kind of weapons that gives North Korea an instant edge. Think of cyber hacking abilities in that context. It doesn't cost them much money. But if you have the right people and if you have the right training, you are able to cultivate an army of people who are able to penetrate into computer systems of other countries. And that's what North Korea is after. But if you consider the fact that there are only about 1000 IP addresses in North Korea available and many of them are basically loaned from Chinese communications companies, you can kind of tell why North Korea is willing to send its hackers abroad rather than...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,391,2022-11-18 02:19:55
17778, but basically loan from Chinese communications companies you can kind of tell why North Korea is willing to send its hackers abroad rather than operate from within what's the matter with operating from within? well first of all it would mean that a lot of information would have to be coming in from the outside world which could risk exposing the government and the people to whatever truth there might be about them so they're sending their train hackers to China and other countries where access to information is better but at the same time because these are allies and also because they have their diplomats station in countries like these like China they're able to regulate and control these hackers better but formally North Korea denies engaging in hacking and describes accusations to that affect as enemy propaganda it took me at least half a year to track down these people it felt like a wild goose chase in the beginning because see a lot of the people like these are protected by the government in South Korea but at the end I was able to find a person who had pretty extensive ties to the North Korean defective community here and then I was also able to gain access to the people who had actually done programming hacking from North Korea before coming to South Korea and Jung is one of them. Jung actually is not a real name I knew before meeting Jung that he was in his late 30s but when I actually met him he looked at least a decade older he wouldn't open up I mean it took me I think at least an hour to make sure that he would trust me enough that he would share with me his life story. When he was first sent to China he was a studio studying computer science at a university near the border with North Korea and he came back and realized that there was a lot more to do in China because he had more access to information and he asked that he'd be sent back to China and there was also recruitment going on for people who would actually do coding officially but really hacking from North Korea so he applied and he got the job. Once he got to the border he crossed by foot and from there he took a bus and then when he arrived at the station that he would spend years in later he learned that the three story building in the heart of a city was actually provided for free actually by a Chinese man who had business ties in North Korea. There were actually two other people that I had met they all said that they go into this freelance website for programmers and clients from around the world would come and give them orders give them jobs to do. Some of the jobs given to Jung were cracking open commercially successful anti-virus programs and once he was able to open that up he replicated that program into another product which his client would repackage as a whole different product to be sold to other people. He also created what we now call BOTs they are very popular online games including lineage he would create a BOT that would just roam around without any supervision from the user and basically trade items without a user on that game. He would grow that BOT on lineage and sell it for almost a hundred dollars. Another defector said the money from clients was wired primarily via PayPal to accounts controlled by minors because they were the only ones with access to legitimate bank accounts. Jung had to make at least a hundred thousand dollars in year and he doesn't get to keep most of it actually most of that money goes to the minors to the Elon Musk przydnem now for jam.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,392,2022-11-18 02:24:30
17779," $1,000 a year and he doesn't get to keep most of it. Actually, most of that money goes to the miners to the North Korean regime. But if you don't meet the quota, and the miners will make sure that they'll put enough pressure on you. And if that happens repeatedly, you will face the growing odds of being sent back home. Among the three people that I spoke to, there's a common thing that they all tell me, which is that on every Saturday, they have to do this propaganda session, which is basically about gathering all the hackers together into a room and they have to recite whatever messages, whatever lines come from Pyongyang, about the Kim family, about socialism. If you're especially someone with a free set of mind, that's stressful. One person actually was really stressed out what he heard about North Korea. Once he was in China, during the propaganda sessions, he just couldn't take it. Jung was a senior member of the unit that he belonged to. And he was good at Chinese as well. Whenever a senior North Korean official came from North Korea to check on the hacking units in China, Jung would accompany that official. He doesn't provide me details, but he calls it unsavory incident that happened between him and an official that he was traveling with. And that altercation prompted him to defect. But there was no one that he could turn to after defecting. He would, in disguise, roam around China. He called me that he actually enjoyed it. He actually enjoyed the freedom of not being known to anybody. Just roaming around a country that was huge. How did he make the money that he needed to carry on? He did the same thing he did at the North Korean unit. He would take orders. He would reverse engineer software to make money. But at one point, he said, who was just sick and tired of all of a sudden? He wanted to find a place where he could just settle down. And he contacted South Korean authorities. Now, he lives in Korea. He met a woman here. Last time I checked, they had a baby. He worked for a software company, ironically, an antivirus company. What keeps coming up in my head, even long after I spoke to these people, is there was one common thing about them, which was the sense of disillusionment. Once they had access to outside information, once they were able to freely roam in the internet, there was a spark. And once they realized that there is a discrepancy between what they think is really happening and what North Korea is telling them every Saturday morning, that's when the spark gets bigger. And that little fire is what eventually drives them to decide to leave, even if it takes a huge risk on their lives.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,393,2022-11-18 02:28:48
17780," won't kill us before it may come on. Since they started popping up in the 1950s, malls have been the quintessential American shopping experience. Useling temples dedicated to the wonders and excesses of retail, food service, and entertainment, the rise of the mall coincided with the growth of the suburbs. The heyday of the malls really is the 1970s, sometimes referred to as the malling of America. They really thrived at providing some sort of public gathering space, some sort of social life in addition to actually getting people places to shop. Over the past few decades before then, lots of developers were building malls and it kind of coincided with the growth of highways. So as more people started traveling and interstate start being built, developers really wanted to put something to attract people to stop. Take a look at an average American mall today, however, and you'll see a very different picture. Closed stores and empty hallways became the norm in many malls even before COVID-19 delivered them another set of problems in 2020. So what happened? This is the story of the rise and fall of American malls. When malls work best, they survived and thrived thanks to their anchor stores. Those are the stores that are on the edges of the malls and that are outward facing to the parking lot. So if you're a shopper, you're going to walk through one of these big, usually a department store. So if you're thinking about macy's or sears or jc penny, those are called the anchor stores. So once shoppers are done shopping there, maybe they wander to the middle part of the mall, shopping at the other apparel shops or even going to buy some food, but you really have to have a reason for people to shop in the first place. Because anchors bring in all those people, they tend to pay very little rent. Around 80% of income from mall owners come from the inline stores inside the mall. Over the past few decades, malls have been facing challenges from all sides. The first being, there's just too many of them. As early as in the 90s, the malls were beginning to compete with each other. We have a lot more retail square footage per capita than Canada. We have only seven times more retail square footage per capita than Europe. After the 2008 financial crisis lowered retail spending across the board, malls and especially their department stores also had to contend with a new challenge that was growing fast. All started to suffer in the early 2000s with the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,394,2022-11-18 02:33:22
17781," the board, malls and especially their department stores also had to contend with a new challenge that was growing fast. Mall started to suffer in the early 2000s with the rise of online shopping. Suddenly they didn't have that captive audience who had to go to the mall to buy something. You didn't have to get up, get in your car, drive all the way to the mall and then see a bunch of other people. You can just do it from the comfort of your own. Department stores overall have become less relevant over the years. Many have fallen totally off and that's Sears, JC Penney. Several bankruptcies in this space have really hurt the industry. But as department stores go, so does the mall oftentimes. So if department stores start closing locations, that means they're usually leaving malls. This is the Greenbrire Mall in Southwest Atlanta, Georgia. It's in many ways emblematic of the problems facing malls today. It's been there since 1965 so for more than half of a century has been serving this area of Atlanta that's predominantly black and also as middle class neighborhood. It started with anchor stores that were department stores. So you had JC Penney and then Riches which was later bought by Macy's. So you had these two, they asked me all chains. It had the first chickfulay in a mall, like that type of format. So when you think about the history of malls, like Greenbrire had like the perfect template, but now Macy's will be exiting the mall. Meaning that the mall will be left without an anchor which is vital to attracting other shoppers to come into the stores. Greenbrire then because it's kind of an example or a test for all these other middleing malls across America about what do you do when these large department stores as a business decision on there and are trying to just stay in the high quality malls, how does a middleing mall survive? What's their next strategy? Greenbrire is a textbook example of how closely the deterioration of the middle class in the US is tied to the health of its malls. The median income for the surrounding area has reduced by $6,905 over the past 15 years to a total of $20,756 per year and yet residents and store owners hope that Greenbrire mall will see better days. Malls are made up of the people and communities that help fuel them. Greenbrire is still a place that people go to and cherish even if on paper it doesn't have the elements that make it a thriving mall. A lot of the existing constituents and residents there feel in many respects that they worked hard their whole lives to be able to experience the American Dream, the single family suburban house in a leafy yard near a big mall that had a great Nasee's and they're very reluctant to see that taken away from them. Now that Nasee's is gone, Greenbrire may try to take inspiration from what many malls were doing in the years following the financial crisis, focusing not on shopping but experiences. That was a trend we were seeing in 2016 up into the pandemic pretty much and by experiences I mean everything as dramatic as a water park or hosting concerts to have people want to come other than just to buy stuff. Having Instagramable malls.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,395,2022-11-18 02:37:21
17782," dramatic as a water park or hosting concerts to have people want to come other than just to buy stuff. Having Instagramable moments, making sure your store is pretty that people want to take a photo and post it on Instagram or Twitter. Historically, the mall has always been a place for teenagers. You like to hang out, see your friends and also kind of be seen at the mall and that hasn't completely changed. But before the pandemic, about 95% of Gen Z's, so today's teenagers had gone to a mall in a three month period. So teenagers are still going to the mall and they've always been keyed to having thriving malls because they're coming into their spending power and once you win over teens, hopefully you're really winning over a loyal customer for life. Not thanks to lockdowns across the country, most malls at one point or another were shuttered in 2020. That means no one using the multi-billion dollar American Dream malls indoor ski slope. No one going to the King of Prussia malls indoor skydiving attraction. Basically, the pandemic gave malls what they didn't need, another problem. What would your net income or net operating income have been in 2022 without COVID and what is it now in a post COVID world? So our view is roughly 10% hit to net income over that period. That's Vince Taboni from the analytics from Green Street Advisors, which rates American malls from A to D just like a report card. And if malls did have a report card, they wouldn't exactly make honor roll. During the US, out of the thousand malls in the country, there are roughly 250 malls, roughly grade A minus or better. D and C quality malls, which is the vast majority of the malls by count, we think are on a negative trajectory. And it's going to depend on a lot of the local dynamics, ownership decisions around how much money to invest in the property. We'll determine whether this mall can survive as retail or rapidly melting ice cube. While there have been a few bankruptcies among real estate investment trusts that own mostly B to D malls in the past few years, A malls really are doing just fine. Some of the most productive shopping centers in the country are super high end. So I'm talking about bowel harbor shops down in Miami, Florida. There is Americana man has it in Long Island's Gold Coast, the Grove in Los Angeles. These are places that have all high end stores and have done quite well. A lot of that has to do with efficiency of their property, so their sales per square foot are really high. But also, they've invested a lot in their actual mall because it has to look beautiful. It has to have all the services that a wealthy shopper expects. So what will the future hold for less sought after malls that can't revive their golden years? For many of these malls, it will mean closure and then hopefully conversion. If they can't get a new use to come in, it's expensive, but you can just demolish it. And there are still quite a lot of sites just sitting waiting. Amazon has been picking up more and more of those building their big fulfillment centers. Also a lot of communities see this as an opportunity to redevelop, re-enhabit this dead mall to help that community meet the challenges it was never originally designed for. The number one reuse of an existing mall is as workspace. It's actually pretty easy to just throw some carpeting down, cut a few more windows and turn it into office space. Sort of number two reuse of malls is either medical, healthcare or education. Lots of great examples of community colleges all the way down to elementary schools. Moving into malls, then the third strategy that I still, I wish happened more is actually just demolishing the mall and re-grain it. Either reconstructing the wetlands that used to be there and that frankly we never should have built on in the first place.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,396,2022-11-18 02:41:40
17783," and re-green it. Either reconstructing the wetlands that used to be there and that, frankly, we never should have built on in the first place or providing community parks and gardens. While most analysts say post-pandemic retail shopping could breathe some life back into the American mall, many are not long for this world. Depending on where you live, it might be time to make one last visit, grab some food, do some shopping, and say farewell. President Trump traveled to Utah today where he dramatically cut back the size of two national monuments in that state. When former President Donald Trump announced plans to scale back two national monuments in Utah, there was outcry from a lot of people. One company in particular. Patagonia really is a resistance brand. They embraced the liberal resistance against President Donald Trump and really put themselves at the forefront of that movement. In 2017, it sued the Trump administration for sort of slashing the size of these two national monuments in Utah that were kind of mechas for climbers. It said at the time joining the legal fracas was both extraordinary and obvious. The company's general counsel said it took exactly one email to the board to decide to actually do that. That's in the case is still out. Well, I think the only thing this administration understands is lawsuits. We're losing this planet and we have an evil government and I'm not going to stand back and just let evil win. This year it got even more active, it changed its mission statement to quote, Patagonia isn't business to save our home planet. And then it manufactured these little tags on some of its clothes that if you flip them up, it says both the assholes out. Very implicit running up to the election and it launched a digital tool to help people find the polling place. And on that digital platform, it says both the climate deniers out of office again and again on the loop. This isn't the first time that taking a stand has paid off the Patagonia. The business which is now worth over a billion dollars was built on it. I couldn't care less about making more money, but by doing the right thing it always ends up making more money. So it's this all a strategy, a sort of premeditated strategy. Who knows? I mean, Sean Hart's been very vocal from the start and makes no bones about. He calls himself a dirt bad climber and an accidental entrepreneur. So I don't think he's fudging this, but what's important?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,397,2022-11-18 02:46:05

So I don't think he's fudging this, but what's important is that it's sort of a textbook marriage of philanthropy and profit. If you want to understand the entrepreneur's study that you and I have the link with, because they're saying, you know, this sucks. And I'm going to do it my own way. Of course, like every other teenage kid, I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. When I was 16 years old, I took off and drove across the country, went into the Wind River Range and discovered mountains. Patagonia was born out of Rockclimate Avantio-Ramada's first business, Schuwenard Equipment, which made in soul climbing supplies. Ivan Schonard was a blacksmith in the 50s, and he started selling climbing gear out of the back of his car. That was less harmful to rock faces. This is sort of the origin story of the company. It's called itself the activist company, an activist company. Six months out of the year, Avantio-R is a blacksmith. He makes mountain climbing gear. The other half of the year he climbs. In 1968, Avantio-Ramada and four friends, including Doug Tomkins, the late founders of the North Face brand, embarked on the ultimate road trip from California where they were based to Patagonia in Argentina. The mountain was in a good mood, dazzling sun, calm air all day. If this weather holds, they could be on the summit within days. This trip became a documentary about these friends who were hippies in the 70s climbing in Yosemite where the sport became a lifestyle. And how these friends became pioneer of the outdoor industry. Schuannard moved from selling petons to polyester and in the 70s Patagonia was born. In 1973, Schuannard and his wife Melinda opened the very first Patagonia store in Ventura, California, where the companies headquarters remained today. Melinda Schuannard was the driving force behind many of the employee benefits, like on-site childcare, that helped the company achieve an impressive 4% employee turnover rate. The retail and consumer product sector average is more than triple that at 13%. I do think that Patagonia was a leader, one of the first corporations to take into account, you know, the human capital and make sure that their staff, all their employees were cared for in many ways, not just wages, but also they just cared about their people and knew that that's a good business model. Patagonia began donating 10% of its profits to grassroots organizations in 1985. This later became the 1% of sales that Schuannard labels and Earth tax. I don't think it's for land three. It's rent for us living on this planet. While Patagonia was creating the blueprint of how to be a socially conscious brand, it was also turning a profit. It even made ink magazines list of the fastest growing privately held companies. So every time the company makes a decision to do something socially environmentally active, it is met with success, and that isn't lost on Schuannard or any of the other leaders of the company. The more money Patagonia made, the more it gave away under its philanthropic program. Between 1989 and 1991, the payroll grew by 40%. But trouble was on the horizon. I think for 1991, we are looking at a recession. The question is how deep that recession is going to be and how long will be in it? Sales fell flat and the bank called in the company's revolving loans.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,398,2022-11-18 02:50:19
17785," They're looking at a recession. The question is how deep that recession is going to be and how long will be in it? Sales fell flat and the bank called in the company's revolving loans. A company that prided itself on taking care of its own laid off 120 people, roughly 20% of its workforce. That was when we decided that we were going to start doing things differently. And we're going to start running the company as if it's going to be here 100 years. With a renewed sense of purpose, Patagonia was ready for what it called business unusual. It started with the costly move to recycle an organic materials before launching a clothing repair service to discourage fast fashion. And Patagonia's influence was growing. What was intended as Schuernart's philosophical handbook for employees became an international blueprint for sustainable business printed in ten languages. What's interesting to me is that all this, I hate the term on brand, but it's very on brand. It really works for the kind of companies created. It works for the kind of employees he's been able to recruit and retain. It all is very seamless in terms of the identity of him and the company and what it means in the marketplace. So over time, the company's mission and its marketing have become the same thing. The inflection point came in 2011, actually Black Friday, Patagonia took out a huge ad in the New York Times that said don't buy this jacket. And it's sort of got into the nitty-gritty on the carbon footprint and the water footprint that goes into a piece of a peril like a parke. And at the time Schuernart said, the best jacket for our planet is one that already exists. So the company at that time said it needed to address the issue of consumerism, which coming from a for-profit business hits pretty hypocritical. As the company encouraged its customers to buy less, its annual sales increased by almost 40%. The stance of this is hypocritical is loud and constant. Talking about consumerism in a critical light while very much being a part of it. Best fashion is top on the list of environmental destruction and not just destroying the environment but impacting human health. They are in the fashion industry, they're clothing retailer and to come head to head with that is courageous. You're not only just trying to create a product that'll last, but you're also educating an entire generation of people to understand that whole ideology that you don't need to change out our outfits. In 2014, Rose Macaria was appointed as CEO. During the next six years, she grew Patagonia into a billion dollar company while also scaling up its environmental goals and bringing a more political voice to its activism. Ivana had this model where he was basically saying you can have a great business, you can make quality product, but you can also do the right thing by the environment, by your employees, by your community. That to me was like the most holistic vision of business that I'd ever seen. Right now, Patagonia has a team of about 20 people solely focused on activism and grants. This all comes at a time in the past decade when consumers are paying much more attention to the social footprint of companies and where they buy their goods. What's happened is all this is good business for Patagonia in the past 10 years, revenue and profit at the company are roughly quite durable. It's private, but estimates are it does about a billion dollars in annual sales, which is sizable, and that's part of the reason why it's been such a fortuitous cycle as it's ramped up its activism and become more vocal on these things that's resonated with the market. As the company branched out into other areas, including a venture capital fund for environmental causes and sustainable food, revenue reached a new peak of over one billion dollars in 2017. But this was still small change compared to fast-f...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,399,2022-11-18 02:54:39
17786," causes and sustainable food, revenue reached a new peak of over $1 billion in 2017. But this was still small change compared to fast-fashion heavywaste like Nike, who made $37 billion that same year. Patagonia's conscience hasn't always been reflected in its customer base either. Personalized vests have become the go-to corporate uniform, and the expensive price tag has helped the brand and the nickname Patagucci. It's expensive stuff, it's expensive apparel, and that is part of their calculus in terms of the activism, you know, a lot of the more sustainable parts of the supply chain are there's a premium for organic cotton or sustainable down. The Patagucci label is a symptom of that. So Patagonia products are very popular, of course, with people who are active in the outdoors, but also with people who are not as active. For instance, you know, people in finance where the Patagonia vests go to the office, and that's because of the image that the brand projects, and so they have to leave with the fact, although they, you know, preach for the environment and want to stand for good, they're victims of their own success. Patagonia set sales records in the first three years of the Trump administration. Now, in 2020, things have changed. Is COVID-19 brought the business world to a halt, and the American people voted in a new administration? Patagonia appointed Brian Gellert as CEO. As far as its CEO transition goes, this one's happening quite strangely. There's no real budget for next year yet because of everything that's going on and all the uncertainty around that. Patagonia's new focus is going to be on forging a relationship with the Biden administration. It should be a more close relationship, but Gellert still has his guard up. During the Obama administration, they didn't always agree, and he expects the same with Biden in the White House. They plan to bring litigation wherever needed against any government needed, and they're going to be active about the issues that they care about, and that's climate change in the environment.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,400,2022-11-18 02:59:23
17787," Shoulder Okay. You built this. So this is all. We've assumed Googlers would want more indoor outdoor options. I mean, it's so exciting. It's such a fun... It is. It is. But I would say the thing we're really excited about are these new buildings because we were building sustainability into everything we do. So really forward looking. More? Good? Okay. From one of the newest workspaces at the Googleplex in Mountain View, California, this is Bloomberg Studio 1.0 with Alphabet CFO, Ruth Porat. We're not far from her childhood home. Her father was a physicist at Stanford, her mother, a psychologist. She was graduating from Stanford herself and then earning a couple more advanced degrees. Porat landed her first job on Wall Street in 1987, where she would spend almost three decades until Google's co-founders lured her to Silicon Valley. It's wonderful to be here with you. It's great to have you here at the Googleplex. Thank you for having us. So we are at Google headquarters in Mountain View and at this very same time you are making massive investments in New York office real estate, you're expanding headcount in Atlanta and Chicago and Washington DC. What's the strategy behind all of this? Well at the core we believe in hybrid work. So we do want to bring people back on campuses but not",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,401,2022-11-18 03:03:53
17788," What's the strategy behind all of this? Well, at the core, we believe in hybrid work. So we do want to bring people back on campuses, but not full-time. We're thinking it'd probably be a three, two work week, but we think coming together is just such a core part of innovation, serendipity, culture, every element of it. And we're growing at a really rapid clip, so we are excited to be expanding our real estate footprint. And then we also wanted to make sure that we're meeting people where they want to be. And so enlarging the number of sites that we have available for people in particular sites where you have great, diverse populations. Sundar just told me that Googlers will have this option to work in a hybrid mode forever, literally forever. Obviously, you're embracing this massive cultural shift. But what are the risks? What do you worry about? So the positive we've seen is there's a productivity uplift we believe in giving people the opportunity to be at home some of the time, not do the commute, be able to deal with everything else in their life, and coming into the office. So the risk is, I think, about my career, and so much of the benefit in my career was the informal coaching being pot-pronented meetings, all of the touch points that you have. And so I think that one of the most important things for all of us as leaders is we need to evolve the way we lead. We need to make sure that we're thinking about this hybrid work life and why that's the way to be the best magnet for talent and make sure that we're continuing to reinforce all of those great practices while opening up new great practices. Speaking of your career, before you were CFO of AlphaBat, you were CFO of Morgan Stanley. And you started your career on Wall Street in 1987. Talk to us about the journey of going from big banks to big tech. Why did you make that leap? And what impact did you want to have? Well, I love seeing it work in Stanley. And I became CFO the day James Gorman became CEO, we asked me to join him in that journey. And that was January 2010. And we were still recovering coming out of the financial crisis. There were still some pretty rocky days and a lot of decisions that needed to be made. And then I got to a point where I felt like we were in a great spot at Morgan Stanley. And obviously, it's continued to do really well. And I just wanted that next chapter. On my view, in my career, I've always been focused on and I've continually learning. And I feel like when you hit a plateau, the right questions, what's my highest and best use? It's been an extraordinary time. You also survived Wall Street in the 80s and 90s, which is notorious Boys Club. And Silicon Valley has sort of come to be known as a Boys Club of its own. How would you compare those two cultures? Well, when I was starting my career many decades ago, it was tough and much worse than it is now. And it evolved. No question about it. Not where it needs to be. But certainly evolved. And I saw it through my career. I would say the biggest difference out here is the level of impatience. And I love it. As the view is, if you can do some of the extraordinary breakthroughs that we have out here, if you can do natural language translation, everything we do with AI, with VR, with self-driving cars, why can't you fix this now? And that level of impatience, I think, is fantastic. Legend has it that when you got to Google, you were going to rain in the spending, tighten up on the moon shots. Your nickname, I believe, was Ruth Vader. Was that a tough job to take on? So I think the narrative was written before I got here. And what I find most interesting about that is I firmly believe the single most important thing in capital allocation is investing for long-term growth. I think if you don't, you are sowing the seeds of your long-term decline. And I learned that really early on in my career. Now, if you're investing in an industry like this and trying to do truly transformative things, by definition, everything can't succeed. And so by definition, you should have the metrics and data and milestones to assess, is it working or is it not? Because if everything's working, or if you think everything's working, I would say one or two things are wrong. Either you're not reaching high enough, or you're not being honest enough with yourself about the pace of breakthrough, whether you're going to get there. So to me, a really natural part, kind of a s-.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,402,2022-11-18 03:07:53
17789," honest enough with yourself about the pace of breakthrough, whether you're going to get there. So to me, a really natural part, you know, kind of a sister organization to investing for long-term growth is actually thinking about how are you doing with the risk that you're taking, stack rack them, and figure out what's at the bottom so you can redeploy those resources to the top. They go together, actually. And so I find the narrative, it's a false choice to think that it's either about growth or it's about pruning, stack ranking. They go together and you have to think of them as actually empowering one another. You advised the Treasury Department during the great recession. What lessons did you take away from that? What struck me is a lot of the lessons from the financial crisis are relevant in good times and bad times. So the most important is it's easier to prevent than to fix. And so, you know, that was really clear during the financial crisis. The financial crisis was about liquidity and it dried up quickly and it would have been really easy six to 12 months prior to build in durable liquidity. You couldn't do it in the moment. And so this notion about really building a solid foundation on which you operate, you need to do that ahead of time. It needs to be all of the work we do on trust and safety and content, moderation, security. That is the foundation on which you can build everything else. The handball at one point said to me, you have to have the will and the means. And too often, by the time you have the will, you no longer have the means. His comment was, be decisive, act early, even in the absence of information. I think that's true in this whole notion of investing for long-term growth. Because if you're not actually assessing progress along the way, and you just assume, you know what, we can keep investing in everything. At some point down the road, you'll say, I wish I had made those tough calls to double down on the things that really matter. What times are we in now? What's your read on the economy today, especially with rising inflation? Well, I think back to March of 2020 and where we were. And I think of all of the intervention and steps that have been taken since then. And you've certainly seen the recovery coming out the back end. And it's been really gratifying from those painful days to see the breakthroughs that we've had not just on the medical front, but we've also seen the improvement across businesses. I think one of the biggest concerns, in particular, is you're seeing us go through a digital transformation and the acceleration of it, is ensuring that everyone has the skills, the digital training and skills to thrive in this new economy. Google now reaches more than half the people on the planet. Why shouldn't we view Google as a monopoly? We often say that people come to Google not because they have to, but because they want to. It's really opening the world for so many people, so that's the intent. I I want to talk a little bit.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,403,2022-11-18 03:12:15
17790," I want to talk a little bit about regulation. You were drawn to M&A in your early days at Morgan Stanley. Microsoft is making some big acquisitions, deals that some think Google maybe would have wanted to win in a former life, is antitrust scrutiny constraining any of your business plans and your ability to compete. So the main thing that we've done throughout our life of Google is really invest in innovation as organic growth and we're continuing to do that at a really rapid clip. We have then layered onto it tuck in acquisitions and larger acquisitions and we're continuing to be active, more on the smaller ones and the add-ons to be fair. But we think there's a lot of opportunity still ahead of us and so we're continuing to invest in partnerships and in some acquisitions and do you think that there's still upside in a lot of different areas. So would you say this regulatory scrutiny isn't slowing you down? It's really important for those of us in certain leadership positions to be very focused on constructively engaging and working with regulators on what are the issues, what is it they're trying to solve and how can we constructively engage with them. At the same time our engineers should focus on innovation and continuing to kind of up the bar and everything we're doing address what is most helpful for our users. Google is facing more serious legal threats at this time in the United States than the other big tech companies. How are those conversations with regulators going? Are they frustrating at this point? Well there's certain elements that are frustrating because I listen to the outline of some of the proposed legislation and I think it's inconsistent with some of the priorities for public policy. So as an example there are a lot of focus on what is called self-preferencing. Are you putting too many of your own products together? But during the pandemic one in three small businesses said they would have failed without digital skills. Why? Because what they were able to do is connect with their users in different ways. So if you go search for a small business you can then go to a map and you can get directed to the small business. That's a good thing. There are 6,000 small businesses who wrote in and said you know what we need these digital tools and skills. Same with a number of things on racial equity. Real surge in searches about where can I, where's a black owned business near me and the ability to direct people through search and maps. So I think that what's really important and that's why I said it's about constructive engagement. Let's make sure we understand what they're trying to solve and work with them on what is it that we're trying to address through products so that the products are helpful in the ways that they want. Facebook has taken a serious reputational hit. Has that had ripple effects or created collateral damage for Google? Well I think that whenever there's a backdrop that's challenging it has ripple effects. But what we're really underscoring is all of the steps and investments that we are making to really protect the ecosystem the way we are commitment to our users. So we know how sacrosanct that trust is and it's all about privacy and what are the steps that we're taking to make. Privacy could protect it for our users. What is it that we're looking at to protect content and content moderations? Google now reaches more than half the people on the planet. Why shouldn't we view Google as a monopoly? So I go back to the earliest days when Google, I first learned about Google back in 1998 and in those earliest days when I heard about this like eighth search engine the question is why do you actually need it? And back at Morgan Stanley it's working with our research analyst Mary Meekers. She actually had her team put up white pages all around the conference room and was doing this comparison, well provided the most responsive results most rapidly and all of a sudden you could see well when did this Google thing actually maybe we do need something new and that's been the ethos at Google since inception is just continue to innovate to make this eight and ever better experience for users and so if we can deliver on that which is what drives people here.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,404,2022-11-18 03:16:24
17791," The motion is just continued to innovate to make this 8 and ever better experience for users. And so if we can deliver on that, which is what drives people here, it's really opening the world for so many people. So that's the intent. Facebook and Twitter are exploring digital currency. What is your thought on the crypto market? And is there a play for Google? So we look at it. There's nothing to comment on now. I think we're much more interested in blockchain and the underlying technology and the implications for the business and also for the way we can support our cloud customers. So certainly a lot of effort there. There's considerable chatter in the crypto universe that Web 3 and the blockchain could circumvent the power of Facebook and Google and more. What do you think about the next frontier of the internet? At this point, I think there are a lot of different things ahead of us that are actually studyingly exciting that enable us to actually continue to address different needs and requirements. Like I look at, for example, in something like health where I think blockchain will be very valuable when you think about health and health records. There also a whole host of other areas where the data analytics that we provide are absolutely critical. Should we make excuses to our employers? Should we tell them like if I have to head to a parent's teacher conference or take a kid to the doctor, do I tell my boss that I'm trying to help? You don't tell your boss. Can we turn the guide today, please? You survived breast cancer twice. What was your biggest fear at that time and how did you overcome it? Well, the biggest fear was I wouldn't make it and I remember when someone at some interview while I was going through chemo said, where do you want to be in five years and I froze because it was I want to be alive. And I learned a couple of really important things. One, given breakthroughs in medical technology, I learned to love the word manageable. This journey does become manageable, not for all cancers, but for many more cancers. And that gave me a lot of confidence talking with other survivors about it is manageable, get the best care. And just plow through it. I was just very grateful. I'm grateful for all of the investments people have made over the years, but for anybody out there and I think everybody sadly will be touched by cancer either themselves or someone they know and love. You're a mom of three sons and I find that especially remarkable because I also have three sons. How have you managed that over the course of this incredible career? How do you find that right mix of focus and...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,405,2022-11-18 03:21:06
17792," I also have three sons. How have you managed that over the course of this incredible career? How do you find that right mix of focus and free time to spend time with your family and doing the things that you love? So my kids give me energy. They're remarkable. And I think one of the important things for me is this notion that you do have to have a mix. That's not about trying to find balance, the physics of which is really challenging. I think when people try for balance, they always feel they're failing on something because something's out of whack. So this metaphor that life is like a kaleidoscope. And you need to have different shaped pieces of glass and different color. And sometimes one is larger than the other. And what's beautiful about life is when it's constantly moving around. And so to me that metaphor has actually been sort of an anchoring principle. The other is you have to put the kids first. So they know that I'm there when they need always. And I think that just making sure that you're setting the boundaries the way you need to, I would say it's much easier today than when I was growing up in banking. We had a cubicle. There was a computer room. You were anchored to the computer room. One of the many beautiful things about going through this evolution in work is understanding that hybrid works. So how do we get rid of mom guilt? Especially in this new work world. I want to shake my mom guilt. How do I do that? Okay. So even when you feel it, just say, you know what? It's an investment in my career because I can stay in this longer and be operating at a higher level if I'm really getting the stimulus from all parts of my life. So you've got to drop the mom guilt and when on the other side mom guilt with kids, I think they get it. I think they understand what we're doing. And you know, they'll never forget during the financial crisis at one point I was working on AIG. We went around the clock. I came home to shower that one like right as we were landing AIG and my three kids had each written me a yellow sticky note with a message on it. And one of them was based, you know, the essence of which was, I get why you're doing this. And they saw it as the right thing for the country. I don't need to over dramatize what it was, but that's what it felt like at the time. And that level of pride, I still have those three stickies right by my bedside because I get it. I get the mom guilt. I wish there were certain elements I could have done differently. But I also see the relationship we have and they understand what it means to actually be engaged in society and doing something you care about. No mom guilt. No mom guilt. Thank you. It's not allowed. Thank you. Should we make excuses to our employers? Should we tell our, like, if I have to head to a parent teacher conference or take a kid to the doctor, do I tell my boss that I'm wrong? You don't tell your boss. You don't tell your boss. Guys don't tell their boss. So what do we say? So I don't think you say anything. I actually made this point at an event at Morgan Stanley. I'm like, do not tell your boss. You've got to get over the guilt. The only way to move on from it is realize I'm a professional. I do things when I, when I can and it makes sense and I get it all done. I just do it on my own timeline. And I actually had a woman who emailed me afterwards and said, I know you said I'm not supposed to tell my boss. So I won't. But I can't not tell somebody. So I'm going to email you. And I'm like, okay, that's step one. I'm going to step five. Step attorney. Do not tell your boss. Tell your boss, you know what? I need to do certain things for myself. And I'm getting, I feel guilty doing it, but I get everything done. There's no question. You are so beyond having to check in with people. Well, thank you. So do not. We're in the middle of this so-called great resignation. And people are reflecting and changing and making big decisions. What's your advice to people in this big evolution? You know, huge choices ahead. Well, I think you framed it really well. I don't think it's the great resignation. I think it's the great reshuffle. And people are reflecting on what do they want and how do they want to work and how do they want to live their life. So I think for all of us thinking about what does that mean for our institutions, it is about evolving the way we work, the way we interact, the expectations that we have to say, but I grew up in a cubicle on the 26th floor of a skyrise. This doesn't work.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,406,2022-11-18 03:25:12
17793," The way we work, the way we interact, the expectations that we have to say, but I grew up in a cubicle on the 26th floor of a skyrise doesn't work anymore. And so what should we do as leaders? And I think that our, this generation appropriately, and it's very exciting, expects more from all of us. And so it's not just in how we work, but it is in what we do. And I think all elements of what's the mission, are you delivering on the mission? Is really important. Okay, so if you rapid fire questions, someone you'd love to have dinner with. Well, I'd love to say my parents, because they passed away in over years ago. Favorite family ritual? We do this crazy thing that we've done for years, which is everybody gets to pick where we travel. We come up with the five different locations, and then we all vote, and then we get the grid, and that's where we go. What's your favorite getaway? Probably, I would say maybe Iceland was the vast. That's an amazing one. New York or California? Ooh, so unfair. Well, sitting here outdoors right now, and knowing I can do that for the rest of the years for you nice, for the energy from New York. So I'm not going to, it's like my, I don't pick amongst children. So, in closing, Google is a massive company, multiple divisions, many bets. Where are you spending most of your time now? I'm spending most of my time on your very important question about capital allocation, because if it really goes to this core point, you've got to invest for long term growth, and making sure that you're investing with the right intensity. I often say, I don't want to get to the two-yard line, but not score. So you need to make sure you're investing with the right intensity to support long term growth. That's the most important area where I would say I spend the bulk of my time, and then of course you have to prioritize in order to recycle to support those efforts. What kind of discussions are you having with Larry and Sergey now about this next phase of Google? So when they made the announcement about the role of change, they really, they were very serious about moving to this board role, and they've been, they're amazing board members. Sundar is, of course, relies on them for council wherever, whenever, but most of the interaction is really around what are we doing at the board level? And you have your freedom to allocate capital as you like. I work closely with Sundar and Phillip and Thomas, yes, we work as a great team. So, what's the vision for Google then, 10 years from now? You know, it's fascinating to, was I think I had the same reaction you did when I heard Sundar say search is the biggest moonshot. And I think that continuing to find ways to be helpful to users, to solve what they need where so many people are coming online, and it, you know, is video going to be the first, the way they understand it's going to be about, you know, search is going to be a different type of experience, so much of it's going to be about voice, first and language translation. And it's going to continue to evolve. And what about for you personally? Like, where will you, you know, it's been so amazing to hear about your journey, and I'm just curious about your personal growth. Like, what you feel you've accomplished in the last, you know, since you've been here and what you hope to accomplish. And I find that the opportunity to try new things and to invest in new things, and as we think about, well, what does that mean for each one of our areas, there's, I think that intellectual curiosity keeps you young. And I think that continuing to learn is like your brain is like silly putty getting pulled in a lot of directions. So, to me, it's continuous learning. Thank you, Paulette. Thank you so much for joining us. It's been wonderful to be here. Thank you. Thank you. Great to have you on campus. Thank you. Music.

17794," Music Thank you so much for doing this. Well thanks for doing it. Of course. So sorry I'm late and I'm coming late. Not at all. It gave us more chance to tweak the lights for the 50,000th time. So you're doing well? Yes. How often are you coming into the office these days? About two to three days a week. How about you? I guess you come in. Yeah, I'm in every day now. So no more kids on the set. I have to ask, is your son still mining Ethereum? He and I literally were talking about it last night. He's like, Dad, you are the one who made me give up on it. I'm like, no, I didn't. But yeah, the thing that's good about this is I think it excites a whole new generation about technology, which is good. I really appreciate taking this time. Well, thank you for doing it and thank you for coming down to do it. I'm ready to go when you guys are. From Google headquarters in Mountain View, California, this is Bloomberg Studio 1.0 with Alphabet CEO Sundar Pachai. Ford and raised in India. Pachai had almost no access to a computer until college. But just years later, found himself rising through the ranks of the world's largest search engine. In 2015, it was Pachai that Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin chose to run Google and later Alphabet. Now valued at more than $2 trillion. It's one of the most powerful companies on the planet. Sundar, it's great to be with you today. Thanks for doing this. Great to be here in person. Google just hit a $2 trillion market cap. Alphabet, I should say. Where is the next trillion dollars going to come from? You know, I've always felt, you know, your market cap elevation is an effect of the value you provide. And I feel fortunate our mission is timeless. You know, there is more need to organize information than ever before. I still feel searches are biggest moonshort as a company. You know, people will want radically more conversational experiences. They will want what we call multimodal experiences. They may speak to search. They may look at something and ask what the information is. Being able to adapt to all that and evolve search will continue to be the biggest opportunity. We are so excited about the YouTube cloud or hardware products. Google Play. So we're building a diverse set of businesses. And underlying all of it is the investments we are making in AI. You know, we've invested $100 billion in R&D in the past five years. And so applying AI in a deep way is probably where we will create the biggest opportunity ahead. Microsoft is making some big acquisitions. Apple's anti-adtracking technology is shaking up the industry. What do you make of these competitive moves? Your competitors say they're on the right side of history. Are they? I look at the fact that. There are three billion people who have access to knowledge of their fingertips. I look at the opportunity we provide. I look at the skills people are learning through YouTube. You know, I feel that everywhere when I go talk to people and. And providing access to information and knowledge, I think will end up being on the right side of history as well. Your predecessor, Eric Schmidt told me that he feels the latest Facebook revelations are disturbing.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,408,2022-11-18 03:33:53
17795," and knowledge, I think we'll end up being on the right side of history as well. Your predecessor, Eric Schmidt, told me that he feels the latest Facebook revelations are disturbing. Google also has access to massive amounts of our data. Why should half the world's population, more than half the world's population, trust Google to do the right thing? We are trying to do more with less data. One of the biggest changes we made was making auto-delete the default setting for new users signing in and now over two billion users have their data continuously being deleted. Look, we rely on trust for people, you know, every day when people come to Google, you know, they place their trust in us in vulnerable moments, maybe a health issue on which they are trying to understand. There's no more important responsibility we have than doing right by that trust. You know, when we provide Gmail to journalists and realize that their accounts may be under attack by an authoritarian government, I mean, that's what motivates us to make sure be privacy, be security, be trust. We are doing the right thing. Over time, regulation will have an important role to play here. I think privacy regulation is important in areas like AI regulation will be important. And so I think, you know, those will be part of the answers as well. The Facebook follow out, that Instagram can be toxic to teens, for example, has this raised more or new concerns for you about the impact of technology, tech addiction, algorithms, YouTube even on our children and their development and their mental health. I mean, you're a parent, and you also have a lot of power over how this plays out. You know, I mean, like you, you know, bringing kids up in this modern digital world is something I think all parents are anxious about rightfully so. I think, you know, it's part of why a few years ago when in YouTube, you know, we were exposed to a set of concerns. You know, we invested, it became our number one priority to work harder. The reason YouTube invested so much in developing YouTube kids as a safe destination for young children, so on. Technology is going to play a big role in helping give children the next wave of opportunity as well. So the answer is to develop it responsibly. We have changed our balance in these areas and saying, we think about content responsibility first, and then the pace of development for new features in areas like YouTube. And so that's how we approach it for a while. Facebook and Microsoft are all in on the metaverse. What do you think about the metaverse? What's Google's metaverse strategy? It's always been obvious to me that computing over time will adapt to people and people adapting to computers. You won't always interact with computing in a black rectangle in front of you. So just like you speak to people, you see and interact. Computers will become more immersive. They'll be there when you need it to be. So it's always been excited about the future of immersive computing and being computing AR. And we're in that count as the metaverse. Is that what that is? Metaverse is, I think it means different things to different people. The way I think about it is evolving computing in an immersive way with augmented reality. As part of that, there'll be many experiences, some of which will be immersive, interactive virtual worlds, which is the metaverse concept. But I think this doesn't belong to any company. This is the evolution of internet and the web, the internet, all of it will continue to evolve. Google was famous for its campuses where you could go and never leave. You had everything you ever wanted. Now you've said they can be flexible, they can work from home, they can work at the office, they can be hybrid, they can work remotely permanently, perhaps. Are you committed to really letting them do this forever? And if so, how does that change the future of work and society? Look, we've really embraced the fact that the future is going to be flexible. At Google, we've always tried to give agency to our employees. But we do realize the importance of bringing people together, the creativity community and collaboration that comes with it. So the balance we are striking is this notion of",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,409,2022-11-18 03:38:03
17796," But we do realize the importance of bringing people together, the creativity community and collaboration that comes with it. So the balance we are striking is, is this notion of three two. And what we are giving, the strength of our companies, we have more locations than most of the companies. So we're giving people a choice to move anywhere in the world. Four weeks they can work from anywhere. We're going to accommodate 20% of our workforce to be remote over time. So we're going to embrace that flexibility. Forever. Forever, yeah. And we're committed to it. Through it all, it forces us to design better products. And since people use Google Workspace, run their companies, I think gives us a chance to innovate and bring all that out. You know, I think there is so much value in giving people more flexibility between their personal and professional lives. And I think it will lead to people being happier. And I think companies can be successful in that model. And so we are trying to get the best of both worlds, but embrace the flexibility and see where we go. How confident are you that when you look back, you'll be able to say Google did enough to help save the world. We are putting so much energy and resources into it. Thank you. You grew up in India. You lived through droughts. Water was scarce. How has that experienced shaped your feelings about the urgency of stopping climate change? I grew up in Chennai, India. We would get water trucked in for the streets and stand in lines and carry a few buckets of water at home. And you know, but fast forward a few years ago, you know, Chennai had one in a hundred year flood, you know, which was a very extreme event. Kind of drove home that combined with a few years ago, waking up to the orange skies here in the barrier, seeing the look of concern on my children's faces and having to explain it, you know, all kind of drove home in a deeply personal way for me. So I think it's the most defining issue we all face and, you know, definitely something very motivated on working towards. I remember waking up to those orange skies too and having to have that same conversation with my kids. Do you think the commitments at COP26 went far enough? You know, encouraged by many things, you know, we have to tip our hat to the people who are working super hard. The issues and the tradeoffs are genuinely difficult, you know, you have to keep the economy growing, you know, it really matters. But at the same time, it's a pretty severe urgent.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,410,2022-11-18 03:42:46
17797," You have to keep the economy growing. It really matters. But at the same time, it's a pretty severe urgent issue. Some are encouraged by the progress. I think it builds on the Paris Agreement. So I can see the forward progress. There is the deep anxiety that it all may not be enough. But we have to be optimistic and keep pushing. Google has set some aggressive targets to run entirely on clean energy, to be the first tech giant to do so 24 hours a day. How confident are you that when you look back on this time, let's say a decade from now, you'll be able to say Google did enough to help save the world. We are putting so much energy and resource into it. It's always been kind of a founding value for us. We've been carbon neutral since 2007. We've been matching our energy consumption with renewable energy over the past few years. So we are now pushing. It's a moonshot to be 24, 7 carbon free. That means every search you do, every email you send, that we can do it carbon free. We were at 61% in 2019. The number is now 67%. We have set our goals to be 100% by 2030. And to do it globally, that means we have to solve new things which we haven't done before. Wind and solar alone won't be enough. We just started geothermal and Nevada. We will be investing in newer technologies, including carbon capture, etc. over time. So that's what excites me. We are a technology company at heart. So part of there are many answers to this problem. Some of it is that we are going to have to innovate our way out of it. And we want to push as hard as possible in doing that. Our Bloomberg New Economy Forum is happening this year in Singapore and the Asia Pacific region is one of the fastest growing internet economies on the planet. Where do you see the most room, the most opportunity for Google to grow there? It's such a firting time frame. Glad you're focused on the region. It's the most vibrant region we see. It's our 20th year since we opened our office in Tokyo. It was the first office outside the Bay Area. You have two and a half billion people on the internet. There are many areas in which they are leapfrogging trends which are here and embracing the future digital payments is a great example. So many of our products originated from APAC, Google Maps, Google Pay. A lot of our journey to bring computing to more people is playing out in Asia as well. I am excited about also the work we are doing through cloud because the companies there are rapidly transforming themselves digitally. So a chance to provide that is something very exciting for us. It's a super dynamic region that I feel like we are learning as Google, being in the region. And so I think it will transform. The first 10 years I would have said we took products here and brought it to APAC over the past few years. We are beginning to build things there. And some of our future global products will be APAC first and rest of the world later. You can't talk about APAC without talking about China and your facing stiff competition from Chinese tech giants there and beyond. What should US policymakers know about competing with China? There's a lot of conversations about US and China, the competition is fierce. Many of the cadet areas like AI and quantum computing where we are investing a lot. Chinese companies are neck to neck. What I think about was encouraged by the news coming out of Glasgow, what the US-China agreement on climate. To me, while we talk about all the areas where we are competing, some of the biggest areas which are common challenges for all of humanity. The pandemic was one. AI and AI safety over time will be a shared one, obviously sustainability is another area like that. So I think these are all areas in which the countries can come together. And so I think that's a way by which we think about as when we compete on the internet and there may be different versions of how the internet plays out. So I see opportunities both sides. What are the chances that Google search will ever come back to China? Or that Google Cloud would ever come to China? Today we don't provide more.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,411,2022-11-18 03:46:46
17798," that plays out. So I see opportunities both sides. What are the chances that Google search will ever come back to China? Or that Google Cloud would ever come to China? Today we don't provide most of our signed-in services in China, and I don't see that changing. But there are ways, as I said, in areas like AI or sustainability, I think there'll be opportunities for us to work together. Through Cloud, we will support multinational companies, which have presents everywhere, and so maybe there are opportunities to work that way as well. AI is advancing at an astonishing rate, and it is hard to understand sometimes what this really means. In concrete terms, how will our lives look different? Let's say 10 years from now as a result of AI. You know, done correctly, you know, in many ways it's going to be helpful to you. You'll take it for granted. The same way today, for example, in India, over one-third of the queries on many phones come through voice. But it's something people take for granted. You can do it. So over time, you'll expect to speak and be able to understand any language in the world. And, you know, those are all ways it's going to make it better. You may go to a doctor's office, and go through a scan, and the system may be prioritizing for the radiologist so that they don't miss some important things, maybe giving them a second opinion. So these are all ways in which it will seamlessly start playing a role, and I think we'll see that. You mentioned if done correctly, and there are concerns. There are fears that AI will replicate the worst of society, even under Google's own roof, from your own researchers. What scares you most about AI? What keeps you up at night? It's the most profound thing we are working on as humanity, and anytime you're developing technology, there is a dual site to it. The journey of humanity is harnessing the benefits while minimizing the downsides. The good thing with AI is it's both going to take time. I think I've seen more focus on the downsides early on than most of the technology we've developed. So in some ways, I'm encouraged by how much concern there is. And you're right, even within Google, you know, people think about it deeply. We publish a lot of research. There are, I think it's more important that there are outside academic institution, governments, nonprofits looking at this issue as well. So I think it'll be an issue which will have a lot of attention, which gives me a lot of comfort as well. You said you'd pick up some new hobbies in the pandemic. What did you start? Cooking pizza, this learning cup, which I was never good at. I'm caught on a little bit better. You have presided over a group.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,412,2022-11-18 03:51:13
17799," You have presided over Google through massive social movements that reverberated in and outside the company. What have you learned as CEO since the walkout? For me, it was a moment. I think it changed the company for the better. We've always been committed. It gave us an insight on what more we could do. We undertook deep commitments. The biggest overall and diversity and inclusion, I think if you're committed and you actually put in the effort behind it, you can make a difference. Now we have stated clear goals. We are on track to meet those goals. But it forced us to think about new answers. For example, tech companies used to talk about the pipeline problem. But we are now going to places where the talent is. We are working much harder. So going to Atlanta, going to DC, going to Chicago, going to New York, that's improving our diversity and representation at all levels. The war for talent is even more competitive now in this new world. What are you offering? Elon Musk has said, big tech is a place where talent goes to die. How do you respond to that? I look at the fact that we are looking to hire 30,000 people next year. I look at the impact we have on many people coming and working in the latest cutting edge things. Many people come and people leave Google. We are proud of people who have left Google. I think there are over 2,000 companies that have been started by whom we call as supers. I'm equally proud of that. I think we are one part of a big system. I think I'm proud of the role we play in bringing in people and the impact they have over time in the outside world. All right. That's most of the heavy stuff out of the way. We're going to do some rapid fire just to get to know you a little bit better. You said you'd pick up some new hobbies in the pandemic. What did you start? I started cooking pizza, cooking pizza, just learning to cook, which I was never good at. I've gotten a little bit better. Cricket or soccer slash football? Wow. Stuff. Boat. Please don't make a quiz. Okay. Squigame or Ted Lasso? I watched both. The Ted Lasso is much more common. I'd rather take Ted Lasso over scoot games any day. I know you're a voracious reader. What's the last good book that you read? I've been on a podcast bench. So a lot more podcasts than books nowadays. Okay. Favorite videos you watch on YouTube with your kids? A lot of music videos. Music videos. This whole notion where creators are watching other things and commenting on it. It's a trend which my kids are really into and I've kind of gotten used to it now. So watching other games, it's a phenomenon. Screen time policy that's worked for you as a parent. You know what's not worked? You know, I've kind of given agency to my kids. The only thing I tell them is that I can look at their digital well-being once in a while with them. And so. How do you do that? I asked them to show it to me and they show it on their phones. So, you know, so that's pretty much the only thing. So beyond that, you know, it's agency and talking to them about it and making sure we are spending time doing other things. Making sure they develop good habits, basically. Metaverse or real world? Done correctly. You know, you shouldn't feel the need to make a choice. You know, you always want to be present in the real world. And when you feel the need to do something, you want to do that. But, you know, I do think presence and the realness of the real world will end up mapping for humans for a long time. Do you own any crypto? I wish I did. I've dabbled in it, but, you know, in and out. Okay. Larry and Sergey, I'm not going to make you choose. How many times a week do you talk to them? You know, I talk to them regularly. You know, it kind of ebbs and flows. You know, and so there are times we get excited about something and we spend a lot of time talking it through, but it depends on, you know, what I need.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,413,2022-11-18 03:55:26
17800, flows. And so there are times we get excited about something and we spend a lot of time talking it through but it depends on what I need. A piece of advice you wish you had in your 20s and a piece of advice you wish you had in your 40s? 20s would be being patient. I think when you're young you're very impatient which is a great thing but sometimes you do amazing things by slowing down and being really focused and doing it over a period of time. And so I would advise the younger version of me to be more patient. Maybe at 40 I would say when I look at climate and I want all of us to be impatient. So I feel like when there's an urgency towards something I think the world needs to be impatient. So that's the advice I would give to a older version of me. How much do you personally wrestle with the decisions that you have to make? I think how much longer do you see yourself being the CEO of Alphabet? Not just Alphabet but also Google? Yeah. On the first one there are moments we all have to make tough decisions and you know and some decisions weigh on me and but it's a privilege to do it. I have very good people helping me think things through so I think the combination makes it all fine. On the second thing I'm looking at it. I'm so energized by the things we need to do. You know I didn't have much access to computing growing up. It changed my life a lot. The one laptop or child goal really motivated me to come into technology and when I look at last week us launching a affordable smartphone in India the chance to bring the next billion users in Asia and in Africa online. That gives me a lot of energy. We'll be watching from afar. Sundar Pachai. Thank you so much for joining us. Thanks for the question.

Jeff Bezos shocked the world when he stepped down a CEO of Amazon. Less shocking was his choice for successor. Annie Jassy was not only one of his longest tenured lieutenants, but the architect of Amazon's multi-billion-dollar cloud business, Amazon Web Services, a moonshot that helped transform Amazon into not just e-commerce, but enterprise juggernaut. Jassy then needed to find his own successor, tapping a former colleague who helped grow AWS in its earliest days, but had since left to run Seattle software giant Tableau. His job to continue the reinvention of AWS and in turn, Amazon. Joining me on this edition of Bloomberg Studio 1.0, new AWS CEO, Adam Sylipski. You worked for AWS for 11 years and then went on to become CEO of Tableau Software in 2016. Then you get a call from Amazon to come back and run AWS as CEO. Tell me about that call. Well, I was having a one-on-one at my prior company and my Apple news alerts went off like everybody else did. It's at Jeff Bezos, he's taking on a new role and Andy Jassy's taking on the CEO role of Amazon. And of course, Andy and I worked shoulder to shoulder about 20 feet apart for 11 years. So of course, I reached out and congratulated him and we started talking. And the conversation turned to some of the possibilities and next thing I know a little while later, here I am back at Amazon.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,415,2022-11-18 04:04:25
17802," You know, the conversation turned to just some of the possibilities. And next thing I know a little while later, here I am back at Amazon, absolutely delighted and honored to be the CEO of AWS and helping to shepherd this amazing business for our customers. In that process, did you talk to Jeff as well? Yeah, I had some communication, but it was principally with Andy who of course was, you know, knew the AWS business best and of course was taking on the CEO role. But yeah, there was contact as you might expect with a small handful of other people. So what did Andy tell you he wanted in the next chapter for AWS? Andy reminded me, nothing I needed reminding, but that it has really still day one for AWS and for our customers. It is still so early in this business. And we shouldn't think that just because the business has grown rapidly, or just because we're currently the leader in the cloud, that it's anything close to mature. And so he really reminded me that we have to stay hungry, innovate as quickly as we ever have done in the past. You're about half a year into the job. What changed while you were gone that surprised you? Well, I think that so many more customers have really adopted the cloud and really decided that they're going all in. So I mean, it was a pretty decent sized business when I left, but it's really grown and the customer base is really expanded. And so now we have very deep relationships at the CEO level, the CIO level across every country, every industry, every use case, and we're regularly interacting with the most senior people at our client organizations. So you were working at Real Networks in the early 2000s, and I understand you were offered a job at AWS without even really knowing what it was. I guess AWS was in stealth mode. Well, it was very secret, so it was hard that the company didn't want to talk too much about it, but of course, we had to talk a certain amount about it. So the call I got went something like, we have this initiative to turn the guts of Amazon inside out and expose it to other people. And it sounded intriguing, although I confess I didn't fully understand what that was all about. So I came in and started talking to Andy and a few of the other senior leaders and eventually to Jeff. And I would have to say that even by the time I took the job, I thought I mostly understand what they're talking about. And it sounds like a good idea and I'm in. But I also was like, well, we'll just have to see how it goes and Amazon's a big place. And so I think we got a lot of intent to succeed here. And that's the thing that impressed me was Amazon really had the desire and the intent and the belief that this could be a really good business. AWS comes out of stealth mode and is the first to market with a cloud infrastructure service in 2006. How important was that first start? And do you think AWS still has an advantage today because of that? I think the time to market advantage that we had, which was probably honestly five to seven years, had started before other companies really started to take this seriously was in a norm. Frankly, it was just one of the biggest things that happened to us in the early years. Because at the beginning, a lot of people didn't get it. I would get asked a lot in 2006. So what does this have to do with selling books? And I even had a slide with kind of a pile of books on it and a question mark next to it. And the answer was it has nothing to do with selling books. But the technology which enables us to sell books, being global, being at a massive scale, being secure, being low cost, being highly performant. All that technology has everything to do with offering these types of services externally. Now AWS isn't a scrappy startup anymore and you do have big rivals, even though AWS is still the leader, Microsoft and Google are big rivals. How do you make sure that being big doesn't slow you down? It's a great question because we are currently the leader and depending on which third party you look at, we're probably a little bit more than twice as big as number two. And it's really important to continue to act as if we're insurgents and to be insurgents and not to start to act like incumbents. And I like to talk about actually managing the business. We want our senior leaders to be managing projects.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,416,2022-11-18 04:08:25
17803," and not to start to act like incumbents. And I like to talk about actually managing the business. We want our senior leaders to be managing product and managing customers. And I think as you get bigger and you put more and more layers into your company, it's all too frequent that you start managing math. You start managing ratios and percentages and growth. And I think it's a real disease if you stray away from really focusing in a deep way on the product you're building and in a deep way on what your customers are telling you. And so we try and organize both with our org structure as well as just with our culture and what we choose to focus on on really making sure that everybody is thinking about one or both of those two things, product and customers. And if you keep even the most senior leaders engaged at that level, then all of a sudden you maintain the urgency and you keep acting like an insurgent. We got to feel that urgency every day. So keep acting like an insurgent. That's the motto. Absolutely. And structure yourself and build a culture that allows you to. It's one thing to say it, but it's easy to say it, but it's much harder to put in place enabling mechanisms that enable you to do so. And we focus a lot of effort on those mechanisms. Now, do you think the cloud keeps getting bigger and that AWS and Microsoft and Google just get bigger pieces of an ever-expanding pie? Or at some point, does it become a zero-sum game? And that fight for market share becomes more brutal and more bloody? Well, I mean, this is a very large market segment. If you look at global IT spend, it's in the trillions of dollars. I've seen estimates like $3 trillion. It doesn't really matter how many trillions it is. It's very, very large. And we've always believed that this was too good a market segment opportunity for the really to only be one winner. And sure enough, you've seen robust competition emerge and we all compete vigorously, but it is, the segment is just growing so rapidly that I think really for us, we believe that the winning business strategy for a long time to come and I would maintain forever is to focus not on the competitors, but to focus maniacally on customers and wake up every day understanding exactly what it is that they need us to build next and then work backwards from there back internally to how can we build those things. And if we do the best job at building the most quickly, the things that are most important for our customers, then I'm really not worried about what the competitors will do. You worked 10 feet away from Andy Jassy in the early days. Tell us something about the Amazon CEO that no one knows but you. You're going to get me in trouble, aren't you? Bye. You worked 10 feet away from Andy Jassy in the early days. Tell us something about the Amazon CEO that no one knows but you. You're going to get me in trouble.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,417,2022-11-18 04:13:18
17804, You. You're going to get me in trouble. We as you know I grew up in Seattle and Andy coming from New York has this fascination I don't understand with New York sports teams. So I've had to endure that for a lot of years. New Yorkers. Yeah. So what are you going to do? Although he's you know he's I think come come come to adopt you know some of the Seattle teams particularly the new hockey team the Kraken here. As he should. As he should exactly. So how do you expect Andy will be different from Jeff or how has Andy already been different from Jeff? Well I think you know we're all different as leaders. I think it's all important that we it's important that we all bring our own stamp to it and and operate within ourselves. I don't think I would be very good Andy. I don't want to presume but I would assume that Andy wouldn't be a great Jeff because you know Jeff's Jeff Andy's Andy and and I'm me. So I think that Andy was certainly bringing a great depth of of experience from AWS which is you know one important part of the business and well having operated that business for so long and I expect that'll also give him an opportunity although he was involved in other parts of Amazon certainly for for for a number of years will be able to bring a fresh perspective to the whole company just as I hope to bring to AWS. And I think that fresh perspective is is often helpful I think just the mere act of change is is useful for for the business for customers for employees and just to shake things up a little bit. So I think just a fresh perspective. How will you be different from Andy? Well I think that the the world around us is changing so so much that we're going to have to be different. It doesn't matter what we did yesterday and right after I joined we actually added two new leadership principles which is very exciting. One's around striving to be Earth's best employer and the second around focusing on the fact that that success and scale bring broad responsibility and those are things about which I personally am very passionate and so I really personally look forward to digging in and helping the company to figure out what are those things that we have to figure out where can we innovate to be Earth's best employer and then also to figure out externally what can we do to really be great citizens of our local communities to be great citizens of our national communities and to be great citizens of the global community. And I'm I care a lot about those things as a lot of other people do here but I plan to put a good amount of energy and time and focus and hopefully help Amazon innovate in all of those areas. How closely do you work with Andy Day to Day? Does he regularly weigh in on AWS decisions or not? Well he's got a pretty broad scope of things to worry about now so he's got a pretty intense day job I believe so he's really focused across the company as you would expect him to be but that being said obviously AWS remains an important part of Amazon and so we touch base regularly be it in person or via email just on the most important things going on in the business. Does Jeff ever weigh in on AWS decisions? Yes I mean really from the beginning Jeff was involved at the very very beginning at some of the most fundamental decisions how do you price EC2 you know what do you name S3 what does the detail page look like obviously over time we the business grew and but this Jeff was always you know available when we needed him and I certainly anticipate that will be the same going forward. So is he still available now and what do you understand that Jeff's priorities are? Sure well let Jeff speak to his own priorities but certainly Jeff has been available when for example we've been doing our annual planning cycle as many companies have and it's been great to have have Jeff you know weigh in on really where we're heading for the next year and beyond and to just make sure it's easy to get focused on the details of the business and it's great to have multiple people who can help you pick your eyes up a little bit. Now you joined AWS in the middle of a pandemic you came back to AWS in the middle of a pandemic that's hopefully moving into the rear view mirror. Moderna is one of AWS's biggest customers if it weren't for the cloud if it weren't for AWS would we have had a vaccine as quickly as we did. I've got to tell you I'm I use but it's been an absolute privilege.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,418,2022-11-18 04:17:12
17805," Quickly as we did. I've got to tell you, I'm Iose, but it's been an absolute privilege for us to work with Moderna because what they're doing obviously is literally life-saving and they've been so innovative and so creative. So Moderna took a drug development process to get to a vaccine candidate. That process would typically have taken them 20 months. And doing that on AWS in conjunction with all the innovation on their side reduced that 20 months to 42 days, 42 days to get the vaccine candidate, the mRNA vaccine candidate for COVID-19. And those really running multiple parts of Moderna on AWS. So if you look at the drug design part, they had their drug design studio running on AWS all the way to manufacturing with the new digitized manufacturing that they call their digital manufacturing platform. So it's really end to end and the ability to use massive amounts of resources and to pick the exact type of service and capability for each part of the job and to really bring the full set of resources to bear. In addition to not having to focus on the IT and the infrastructure and the technology and rather letting Moderna focus on the all important job of drug discovery. So working in partnership, it was just magnificent to see what they accomplished. Since you joined AWS, a number of longtime AWS leaders have moved on to Microsoft, to Stripe, to Tableau, does that concern you? Well, actually retention has been very good. If you mentioned the senior leaders, if you look at the VP plus ranks, the VP and above ranks at Amazon, the average tenure is over a decade, over 10 years. So that's actually very, very strong retention. So of course, you're always going to have some level of people coming and people going. And at the end of the day, that's actually healthy for the business. You want new perspectives to come in. Of course, in the right proportion. Amazon has opened an investigation after 550 employees supported a petition claiming a culture of discrimination, harassment, bullying and bias. What's the status of this? Well, we are incredibly focused, and I personally believe it's incredibly important to really have a very diverse, inclusive and equitable environment. And we're going to make sure that whatever it takes that we've got that. So we believe that we're really doing a lot of things to deliver on that. And we've got a lot of innovative efforts around bringing in a diverse workforce, which we have to have both because we're going to serve our customers best, their diverse. We have to match that diversity. And also, I just believe it's our responsibility and it's the right thing to do. Yeah, anytime there is any possibility that things are not, something is not gone the way we wanted to. We're going to investigate it thoroughly. That's what we're in the middle of doing in this case. And we'll make sure that we're operating in a way that's consistent with our values. And that's always the only goal. If you could rewind to the early 2000s, the earliest days of AWS, is there anything you would have done differently to build an inclusive culture, to start with a more inclusive culture, to make sure that it didn't become a boys club? Well, I don't think that's what we have. I think that we do have a really fun, exciting innovation led and inclusive culture. And that being said, these are hard problems. I think we've done a lot, but we are nowhere close to where we need to be. We're going to be restless and dissatisfied with our progress on DE and I, just as we are with every other part of our business. Mark Zuckerberg is making a big bet on the metaverse. How big do you think it's going to be? Such an interesting sentence. The metaverse is real.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,419,2022-11-18 04:21:28
17806,"PP� AWS has the biggest trove of sensitive corporate data in the world. I'm curious how you think about the balance between data and privacy and freedom and civil liberties in the modern era. I mean, there are governments. There are nation states around the world that want that information. Hackers and criminals want that information. Well, we're very clear to start with that. Our first job is security. We often say security is job zero. It was on the first page of our operating plan pretty much every year that I can remember. But what about when governments request that information? So, we're speaking of that information. Sure. Well, we are very clear that our customers data is their data. So the data belongs to our customers. And not everybody operates that way. We are not going to look at customers data. We are not going to compete against our customers using their data. Their data is their data. And furthermore, we have all sorts of architectural best practices that our customers should be and are using for any sensitive data. And so a lot of that really relies around encryption. And so we build a lot of different encryption capabilities so that any sensitive data, which could leak for any reason, be it to a government, be it to a hacker, be it to anyone else, any form of security breach, that it's encrypted and useless to anybody else. Given the broad array of encryption solutions that we provide, it's actually very doable and powerful for our customers to safeguard their data that way. Mark Zuckerberg is making a big bet on the metaverse. Is AWS going to have a role in the metaverse? I think AWS already has a big role in the metaverse. So I think the cloud enables the metaverse. So if you think about all of the compute capacity, all of the storage, all of the machine learning, which is required to create, compelling and delightful end user experiences in the metaverse, a lot of that is already today running on AWS. So if you take Epic Games, for example, so Epic Runs Fortnite, massively popular game, 350 million users worldwide and Epic Runs, almost everything on AWS from the backend, servers to the analytics and everything in between. So I think that's a great example of the metaverse at work and all that's happening today on AWS. And we anticipate that's only going to grow really rapidly in the future. How big do you think it's going to be? Such an interesting sentence. The metaverse is real. And yet it's virtual at the same time. I think that if we continue to do what we've always done, which is to provide a technology platform that allows organizations to transform, then these gaming and entertainment and social media and other companies will be able to do what they do best, which is to focus on innovating on behalf of their end users. And I think that the metaverse and many other areas will be rich with invention. So this next conversation will happen in the spheres in the metaverse.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,420,2022-11-18 04:25:59

17808," I was running ads beforehand and that's been the main way Google generates revenue and so a lot of people said like why did you leave that and go to YouTube but I always believed in digital video and I believe that now we see that the world also believes we've seen a lot of adoption of digital video and the benefits that that can have. You've championed this diversification strategy at YouTube since you started. What's working and what's not working? Well our main way of generating revenue is from advertising but we also have really grown our subscription revenue and that has been really really important from many different reasons so that has enabled our users to have an experience where they can have music, YouTube music and premium. We just announced the 50 million subscribers that we were really excited about but we also see other ways that our creators generate revenue so our creators for example generate revenue with channel subscriptions, they may sell merchandise. We also have things like digital goods so like super chat, super thanks and so we've basically diversified the number of ways that our ecosystem is generating revenue. The original tagline for YouTube was broadcast yourself and that concept has exploded. You have ordinary people in the spotlight when they grow up they want to be an influencer, they want to be a YouTube star or a YouTube creator. What do you see as the future of the creator economy? I see a lot of possibility with the creator economy and because I see that many people have a lot of interest and they have a lot to offer and beforehand they went up and able to have shared that with the world and so there's so many people depending upon what their talent or their interest is whether it's a sport or cooking or gaming or hairstyles that people have come out and really been able to share that and create a lot of jobs. So we actually see like our we actually saw a 35% increase in the number of creators that are generating six-figure income out of YouTube and in the last year and so that's just an example of like how the creator economy is continuing to grow. Well and for years YouTube was the only company that actually paid creators but now a lot of companies are paying creators. Facebook, Instagram, Snap, TikTok, how do you see that competition playing out? Who wins? Well it is a competitive landscape and in general competition is good it makes everyone work harder and that's good. I mean we look at creators and we say they're going to come to us if we do the best job and creators come to us looking basically for fame and fortune. Like how can I I have a skill or I have a talent, something I want to share with the world like and YouTube can help that be known, can help them provide that fame but also we can generate revenue for them. And so as long as we're doing a good job of that creators are going to come to us if we start to fail then they're going to leave us and they're going to go to another platform and so we just need to work really hard to make sure that we deliver that for our creators. A year ago during the Black Lives Matter protest YouTube made big commitments to Black creators in particular. What's been the progress there and how do you see YouTube the potential for YouTube to be used as a tool for social justice? Well so we've made an announcement that we were going to do a $100 million Black Voices fund and so we're continuing to develop content there but one of the other thing and I think there'll be there's been a lot of great content that's come out and we'll certainly see more but you know because YouTube doesn't have any gatekeepers like you can just post and become a creator you know we've we have seen a lot of people of different backgrounds and underrepresented backgrounds become creators and have audiences. We never really measured it beforehand because we didn't have a way and so one of the things that we've done is with and with enabled creators to now tell us what backgrounds they they affiliate with so we can have a better understanding of how they're doing on our platform. Let's talk about YouTube shorts. It seems to be a top priority. Yeah we all know that TikTok is on the rise. How important are YouTube shorts to the platform to the company? So YouTube shorts it's very important. We see that creators and users want to watch all types of content long form short form. It turns out that the first video that was actually ever uploaded to YouTube, me and the zoo was in the 18th second.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,422,2022-11-18 04:37:24
17809," and users want to watch all types of content long form short form. It turns out that the first video that was actually ever uploaded to YouTube, me at the zoo was an 18-second video. So it was a short form video. And we have lots of short form videos and we've had it way before TikTok did. But what we have really been leaning into more is just enabling those to be found and then a lot of the creation tools. And so bringing a lot more mobile creation is really important for us going forward. Did you notice that viewing time was being lost to TikTok? Did you see that trend? And do you see TikTok as a sort of existential threat? I mean we definitely see many competitors in this space. What we're just focused on are like our own metrics like do we see our users engaging? Where's our opportunity? We're always looking around and seeing what our competitors are doing. And if they're doing something that we think would be good for our users and our creators, we're also going to look at how we can improve our own economy, creator economy and what's good for our users. I think a lot of people, you know, we talk about vaccine hesitancy and they blame social media. They say YouTube not doing enough. One of the big things for us is to continue to work with public health experts to get their messages across. Today's your big day. Are you excited? Mama is tired. They speed up work. You have to feed your creativity. So this tree house, you guys ready for the movie? See what we can do. At this point, YouTube has become a hub for discovering information for, you know, it satisfies our curiosities, right? That comes with a lot of inspiration, but also with misinformation. When it comes to vaccines, vaccine hesitancy, videos that cause a public health risk, where do you want to see YouTube do better? We've taken responsibility very seriously. It's been one of my top priorities. So first of all, we want to make sure that if there's information that violates our policies, we came up with 10 different policies around COVID. Then if that's a violation of policies, then that's something that we'll remove. We removed over a million videos associated with COVID, but we also want to make sure that we're raising up information that we think would be that come from trusted and authoritative sources. And we've really been able to do that. I think a lot of people, you know, we talk about vaccine hesitancy and they blame social media. They say YouTube not doing enough, you know, how do you respond to that? Yeah, I mean, I think, first of all, we're always learning. I just, just to be fair, like we're always thinking about how can we do better? We're looking at the feedback and working with public health experts across the board. And, you know, I think one of the big things for us is to continue to work with public health experts to understand, you know, what are the ways that we can partner with them to get their messages across. And I really believe that that is something that's really changed is the evolution of bringing.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,423,2022-11-18 04:41:52
17810," So we can partner with them to get their messages across. And I really believe that that is something that's really changed is the evolution of bringing creators, musicians, experts talking about public health. We never would have seen that before in the pandemic. How much do you internalize the criticism of YouTube's content? Do you take it personally and how does that influence the decisions that you make as CEO? I want to be doing the right thing and I care about that. I care about the legacy that we leave. I care about the world that we leave to our children. I care about how media is consumed by the next generation and by everyone today. And so I really have put a lot of time and effort to make sure that we are acting responsibly. And there's always a balance between the free speech and the right, but being responsible and taking down content that we think could lead to some kind of real-world harm. And so I mean, sure, I think whenever you're in a position like that, there's going to be a lot of criticism. But our goal is just to continue to talk to experts and evolve. And how do you make decisions in those tough moments where it's a tough call? Like how much of it is making a decision or leading by consensus and how much does it come down to you? The goal is that when we have tough decisions, they're not, they're like improvising in some way. Like we've made a concrete set of decisions beforehand and then we're looking and saying, is this something that meets our standards? Is it a violation or not a violation? And if it seems like there's some set of issues with the content that we have on the platform, we're going to go back to experts and then reevaluate. Should we be making changes to our policies? YouTube helped keep a generation of children connected, educated, entertained, distracted through the pandemic. What have you learned from that experience and what do you see as the potential future of YouTube as a tool for learning, as a tool in schools? When I meet people and they find out I'm the CEO of YouTube, almost always, they tell me about something they learned on YouTube or something that they're something their family member learned. So I see that as being a very significant part of YouTube. During the pandemic, we certainly saw that a lot more education went online and we had all the homeschooling. We had people who had to also just learn a lot of skills that they hadn't learned beforehand. But probably the biggest thing that we also learned was just, and that I really saw was the need for us to continue to work with educational institutions and the need for us to be able to integrate with some of the learning tools that the kids are all using because they are using YouTube and there's a lot more that we can do to really help educators have YouTube be a key part of the curriculum. My kids are on YouTube a lot and sometimes more than I want them to be and sometimes it's super productive and they're learning something cool and sometimes it's not productive at all. How are you innovating to make the time that kids spend on YouTube more valuable and of course safe? It's very important to me as a parent to make sure that we're giving parents options about how what they want their kids to see. And that's one of the reasons that pretty much as soon as I got to YouTube, we started working on YouTube kids, which is a separate app, which is important for kids in terms of how we can control the quality and we can give parents a lot more control about what kind of content is appropriate for them and their family. And you know, there are many other things like we actually just came out with a supervised experience for tweens because tweens was one of the age groups that was actually hardest. They usually don't want to be on the kids app, but they're not 13 to be on the main app. And so the supervised experience is something that we recently came out with. The Wall Street Journal has been doing some in-depth reporting on Facebook. The report is that Facebook knew that Instagram was toxic for teen girls and didn't do anything about it. Does YouTube look at the impact it has on teen users? The influence it might have on someone's body image or self-esteem? First of all, I think it's a very important topic and we do have a panel of experts that we work with to be able to help us understand what are the different ways that our product could be used or how do we face some of these challenging issues to make sure that we're getting the best advice. And we certainly do see for a lot of-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,424,2022-11-18 04:46:06
17811," How do we face some of these challenging issues to make sure that we're getting the best advice? And we certainly do see for a lot of really tough issues that YouTube can be a really valuable resource. So body positivity, mental health, we see a lot of creators actually talk about mental health. And that for a lot of kids, it's really, it like destigmatizes and enables people to talk about what's happening and what's going on with them. The potential long-term impacts of YouTube on teens and on children, whether it is toxic or whether it's addictive. Is that something that you wonder about? Is that something that you struggle with not just as a CEO but as a mom? We certainly want to make sure that we are doing what we can to be responsible with kids and in every way possible. And that's one of the reasons that we actually have worked hard to give parents as many options as possible for them to decide what is important for them and their family. Whether that's like limiting screen time, like limiting what is the content they actually have access to. I mean, even letting parents just say, these are like the 10 videos. My kid can only see these 10 videos. And so that is really important for us to give the tools back to parents for them to decide what is best for them and their family. Are you concerned about looming regulation? There may be regulation that is well-intended, but actually then has a really negative impact. I would like to begin by addressing the heinous attack on the United States Capitol. Like all Americans, I am outraged by the violence, lawlessness, and mayhem. How much did President Trump test YouTube and how much did it test you as a leader? Election integrity is something that we see incredibly, it's incredibly important. And we've leaned into in every way we possibly can. We treat all public figures and all public leaders the same as we treat any individual. And so meaning that everybody is held to the same standards. And so we definitely held President Trump as we would hold all other presidents and all other elected officials to the same standards that we hold our creators and anyone else on YouTube. But was that difficult for you as the CEO of the company? I mean that's kind of that's like a big responsibility. I mean yeah it is difficult but it is very important and we also are global. So we're dealing with leaders from all over the world. And there were a number of leaders that and there continue to be a number of leaders that that poster that there's content that may be a violation of our policies. But we do hold a consistent standard across everything that we do. YouTube was the last platform to ban Trump and you have said his channel will be reinstated when an",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,425,2022-11-18 04:50:33
17812," platform to ban Trump and you have said his channel will be reinstated when an elevated risk of violence has subsided. How and when specifically will you make that decision? Well, we'll make that decision based on a number of different factors, whether that is like events in the news, signals we're seeing from the government. And we'll certainly continue to evaluate that based on a large number of signals that we see. Will he ultimately be reinstated? I mean, we've stated that we will reinstate him when we believe that there is no risk to public safety or no public danger. We'll just remove devoting app for Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. The Russian government seems to be stepping up requests to take down content. You've talked in the past about your family history, your grandparents living behind the iron curtain being concerned about censorship back then. And Russia is a huge YouTube audience. How concerned are you about Russian government overreach? One of the things that is important to us at YouTube is the fact that we do enable so many voices and that we do enable people to express themselves and really celebrate the freedom of speech. And we certainly, that's a core value of ours. But when we work with governments, there are many things that we have to take in consideration, like whether it's like local laws or what's happening on the ground. And so there's always going to be multiple considerations that we're going to have to take into consideration. Navalny said that YouTube deleted a video, one of his videos. Was that at the request of the Russian government? We certainly get requests from governments. And we look and consider why are we getting the request, what's actually happening on the ground. And based on a whole bunch of different factors, we make a decision. So we don't always, those are not always requests that make sense for us to honor, but in certain cases, we will honor them in that country. The Biden administration seems to be targeting big tech. We've seen Mark Zuckerberg. We've seen Jack Dorsey now testify before Congress multiple times. And I've heard it said that YouTube is getting a pass. Do you think you should be up there testifying? Well, I think we do go a lot of scrutiny. I feel like there's a lot of scrutiny. And because YouTube is part of Google, Sundar has testified a number of different times and answered many different questions on YouTube. So I do believe there's a certain amount of scrutiny. And if I were ever asked to testify, it certainly would go and testify as well. You're one of the most senior women at Google. It's not the most senior woman at Google. Google has faced a lot of scrutiny for how it treats women in recent years. How much progress do you think Google has made in hiring and promoting women across the company? And how much progress do you think still needs to be made? I see a really big effort across technology as a whole to be able to be more inclusive. And I think that is really positive. I've been a big supporter of it. It's the very beginning. And I mean, I think at Google, there are many efforts and there's a lot of work that has been done. And I'm sure there's a lot more for us to continue to do. And if you just look at the stats, you can see there are not enough women. We need more women in technology. And I think we have made a lot of progress. But it's still hard. It's harder to be a woman in technology. It's harder to be a minority of any kind. And so I think there's still a lot of work for us to do. When we last spoke five years ago, I asked you about being a mom. You have five kids and you said something that really stuck with me. You said being a mom makes me a better leader. I prioritize better. I see something growing fast and I run towards that. If something's growing closely, I'm like, I don't have time for that. How has that management strategy played out for you? I think it's played out really well. I mean, prioritization is everything when you look at it. Because we have a lot of opportunity. There's a lot of moving pieces, very dynamic environment. So if you can prioritize and say these are the most important things to do, then you're going to get there faster. Larian, start. They have no left. How long do you plan to keep running YouTube? How long do you plan to stay at Google? As long as I have a mission that I believe in and that thinks that I'm excited about getting done. So I have.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,426,2022-11-18 04:54:48
17813," I'm running YouTube. How long do you plan to stay at Google? As long as I have a mission that I believe in and that things that I'm excited about getting done. So I have a lot of ways that I see that YouTube can continue to grow. I have a lot of products and ideas and things that aren't yet released and things that aren't yet doing. And I'm excited about getting those done. So I think if there comes a time where I no longer have a list of projects where I feel like I don't have that much more to add, then it'll be probably time to do something else. Would you throw your hat into the ring to be Alphabet's next EO or if the board asked you, would you step up and do that? Well, I think Sundar's doing a great job. Very, very, please. I think he's doing, I mean, it's a very challenging job. There's a lot of different constituents and a lot of product, a lot of different issues. And I mean, I'll just say I'll always do whatever would be wherever I could be most helpful to the company. Do you still talk much to Larry and Sergey? I do still see them socially though, not work-wise. Do you ever talk about work? I mean, sometimes we'd be casually, but our business is very complex right now. And there's a lot of things that are happening. And so it's hard for, I mean, people may have different opinions, but to really engage it's a long conversation. What do you want your legacy to be? I am proud of the way that we've been able to enable people to have a channel, to have an audience. I just met with a number of three creators. And YouTube really was able to let them shine and create audiences in a business and employ people that otherwise never would have happened. And so that's certainly one. Continuing to grow that. I'd say a second, it's been really important to me to see a lot more women in technology. That has been just a personal goal of mine is to be a role model and try to support women.

17814,"hero This is one of Dave Rayk Middle East, our top stories this morning. The Fedhawks continue to pack away optimism for any lead-up in tightening, Jim Bullerts he's rates going to a minimum of 5%. Even under these generous assumptions, the policy rate still isn't at a zone that might be considered sufficiently restricted. To get to this sufficiently restrictive level of policy will need to increase the policy rate for that. Brent crude dips below $90 a barrel for the first time since October on global demand concerns and that's despite Saudi Arabia cutting oil exports shortly this month. Sources tell Bloomberg that Elon Musk's hard-core ultimatum to staff has prompted more of an employee ex-illustin he expected, potentially putting the company's operations at risk. And 12 years after being awarded the Tournament, Qatar's World Cup is nearly upon us kicking off the Sunday. We look at just what the Gulf state is getting for it's reported $300 billion spent. Just got 90M across the average, I'm used to get my routine into buy. We're seeing markets waned by some of the warnings from the Fed on the SAP 500 Mini, we are looking for a catalyst in either direction on this Friday trading day just around the flatline. Unch as a war unchanged doesn't get any better and more accurate than that. At the same time, US 10 year yields range bound at $376.20 overnight though there was a lashing for treasuries by the hawkish talk with the Fed peaks seen above 5% especially on the short end of the curve. The Bloomberg dollar index on the pressure by Goldman Sachs seized the dollar having room to strengthen in a bumpy ride ahead and then Brent crude were back above $90 a barrel. It's been a volatile couple of hours but the key point here is that we're seeing weakness in crude broadly for the week despite Saudi Arabia cutting exports $430,000 a day by mid-November. Let's get to the next one.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,428,2022-11-18 05:03:46
17815," Weakness and crude broadly for the week despite Saudi Arabia cutting exports, 430,000 barrels a day by mid-November. Let's get to the repricing of the terminal rate to 5.14%. You have to go for our clients. Oak tree putting out a note saying that rates are going to stay near the 5% mark. Okay, that's not an outlandish call. But what is, is that it's going to stay at 5% according to Howard Marx for the next 5 to 10 years. It's a slide 6 to stand out from Fed James Bollard's presentation, saying that 5% scenario interpretation of the Taylor rule, that's a general scenario. The peak rate could go even higher than that. I want to get to the metal space. This time around it is iron ore. The third weekly gain for the metal. This is on this China property package that is meant to deliver on various components of the China property market and to try and stabilize some of the anxiety. 16 point plan in a real estate sector that has been hit by a crisis and revived nationwide. Steel consumption but concerns remain nonetheless. We're up 7% of the last 5 training sessions. Let's get to some of the other moves in Asia and avail droulers' stories from Hong Kong. Annabel. Thanks, Yusaf. It's quite interesting as well. A lot of those moves and commodities also being driven by this expectation that China is going to continue this easing of COVID-19 policies. That's also the dominant theme we're seeing across the China tech space today. Given we had those earnings out from Alibaba and we saw a profit beat for the quarter. But also two things that really helped invest as the first is this announcement around plans for a shared buyback. That was one big factor and then the other was the company saying that it's more optimistic about the outlook for COVID restrictions or the COVID backdrop in China in general. And so that's really led to a gains across the tech sector today. If you change on now that's also helping the broader mood in Asia today. We are seeing the CSI-300. A fairly flat but still the hang saying advancing into the afternoon session. Also, Korea high today and it does also track this call that we had out from Goldman Sachs. So it's actually upgrading its forecast for both of these two countries here. Interesting, of course, given that they were the laggards in 2022. But going into 2023, we're Goldman Sachs is saying actually they're more bearish on the outlook for some of the Southeast Asian economies instead. But certainly this is a picture of a market today. You said that has been more optimistic just based on what's happening in China versus the other big narrative. And that is of course the Fed. Thanks, Annabelle. For that, that's the Annabelle viewers. We will check back in with you later on the program. So the Fed has been out and forced again pushing back against the pivot narrative. Neil Kishkari says he needs to be convinced that inflation has at least stopped climbing before advocating any change. Meanwhile, you've got Jim Bullard reckoning that rates should go to at least 5 to 5.25%. Let's get more with Bloomberg's and the current on this. And I'm not going to color or frame my question in any way. I'm simply going to ask you for your reaction. My reaction is it's more hokushness use of. And it adds to the idea that the Fed funds rate is going to end up higher than I think even money economists were expecting. Recently, you had Jim Bullard overnight upgrading his own estimates saying it now needs to get up to some more between 5 and 5 and the quarter percent to Fed rate. That's the kind of zone he's talking about to make sure inflation is under control. You had married daily, by the way, earlier in the week as well from the San Francisco Fed make the point that she thinks maybe four and three quarters, five, five quarters, a kind of territory need to get the Fed funds rate to. Jerome Powell, a few weeks ago said the Fed rate should be hard and expected. And as you mentioned as well, Neil Kashkari, president of the Minneapolis Fed, all throughout saying look, he needs to be very sure that inflation has stopped accelerating before there's any kind of a conversation about pausing on the whole rate hike and cycle. So it's pretty hokush stuff. I mean, hold the bait about the Fed at the moment is less now about what pace of hokushes you're going to go at. Most people expect them to slow down, consumer inflation is heading the right direction a little bit. So maybe go by 50 base points in December. But a big question now is where do they stop? And these comments overnight suggest that suggest to have a little bit further to go. I mean, I'm going to pay closer attention to slide six in the future as well from other presentations because that's where we had, you know, quite, quite the surprise from James Bullard. And thank you for the analysis that's the end of current in Hong Kong. Now earlier this week, Elon Musk.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,429,2022-11-18 05:07:53
17816," That's where we had quite a surprise from James Bullard. And thank you for the analysis. That's the end of current in Hong Kong. Now, earlier this week, Elon Musk issued an ultimatum to Twitter employees, either committed to the company's new hardcore work environment or leave. Well, the deadline has now passed. The sources tell Bloomberg that so many workers have chosen to go that he, then he expected, that major complications are resulting. Sue Keenan has more. So, it's been a long time. The sources inside Twitter report new levels of chaos and confusion and say that Twitter's offices in San Francisco are now closed until Monday. This, after the new billionaire owner, Elon Musk, put out an effective put up or shut up ultimatum to staff, telling them to either commit to working long hours at high intensity, and there's been talk of AD hour work weeks, or to leave it except a three month severed package. So, the sources say so many more people than expected opted to leave and decline must pledge that it potentially puts Twitter's operations at risk. Now, a memo seen by Bloomberg also urges staff to refrain from discussing confidential information on social media or elsewhere. And some employees who were leaving speculated that so many are now departing along with their knowledge of how the product works, that the social media network may have trouble fixing or updating systems during its normal operations. Of course, things are also complicated by a possible national security review of Musk's $44 billion deal by U.S. government officials. That's according to people close to the matter. Musk consummated his deal to take Twitter private at the end of October, and there have been multiple problems and headlines ever since. Bloomberg, Sukhin and New York. And from the drama around Elon Musk, let's get to the world cup. 12 years after being awarded the Terminant Qatar's event is nearly upon us, the opening ceremony. And the first match happened on Sunday. The world will be watching not just for the action on the field, but for potential trouble around human rights. Simone Foxman joins us off from outside the L-Bate stadium in Qatar, Simone. Yeah, 60,000 people will descend on the stadium behind me on Sunday to watch an opening ceremony and then to watch the initial match between Qatar and Ecuador. This whole process of hosting the world cup has caused an enormous amount of money, some $300 billion for Qatar. The country has undertaken an enormous building plan to construct a new metro system and modern new port, as well as expanding its airport and building 20,000 new hotel rooms. But all of that is really crucial and put to the test right now because there has been controversy swirling around this event really ever since Qatar won the rights to host it. First, there were corruption charges, then there were concerns about the working conditions for laborers in this country. And of course, we're all going to be watching to see how people on the ground find it. Can people go out in the street, wave rainbow flags and protest and supportive gay pride? Can they get drunk and will security guards come and arrest them or do whatever? Those are all questions we have yet to determine. But we are seeing fans start to come into the country finally, as we are just about 48 hours from the opening match. Simone, thank you for the scene, Senator. That's just a moment, Foxman, at the L-Bate stadium and Qatar will have a chance later on in the program to reconnect. Let's check in on the first word headlines now from around the world. Here's what we're watching. North Korea has fired a suspected intercontinental ballistic missile after warning the U.S. of fierce moves if it continues conducting joint military drills with allies in the region. South Korea's military says it believes the missile launched by North Korea was an ICBM without providing for the details. North Korea fired a short range ballistic missile on Thursday and that happened shortly after its foreign minister issued the warning to the U.S. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky appears to have softened his existence that the rocket that struck Poland this week was Russian. Zelensky told the new Bloomberg New Economy Forum that images suggest that the damage could not have been caused only by Ukrainian air defense weapon.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,430,2022-11-18 05:12:20
17817," It is suggested that the damage could not have been caused only by Ukrainian air defense weapon. NATO and the USA, it's unlikely the blast was caused by a Russian missile while still laying the blame on Moscow. I don't know what happened this time. We don't know 100%. I think the world also does know what happened on present in their situation. But I'm sure that this is a Russian missile. UK Channel Jeremy Hunt has outlined $65 billion in tax hikes and spending cuts. So the government can't plunge a hole in its budget. The wealthy will be hit with higher taxes on wages and dividends. A windfall tax on oil and gas companies has been extended. Hunt says the British economy is already in a recession that will shrink out by 1.4% next year. And Nancy Pelosi has announced she will step down as the US House Democratic leader. The decision comes after Republican Securities Slimhouse Majority in last week's midterm elections. The 82-year-olds announcement concludes her history making tenure as the first woman to serve a speaker and opens the way for a generational change in the party's congressional leadership. And with great confidence in our caucus, I will not seek re-election to democratic leadership in the next Congress. For me, the ours come for a new generation to lead the Democratic caucus that I so deeply respect. And those are your first word headlines. Here is what else is still coming up on the show. We talk Middle East markets with Fahnig Ball of Credit Suisse. His Brent dips below $90 briefly for the first time in September. But up next, Aberdeen Asset Management's James Asset on the Fed Hawks pushing back gets hopes for a pivot. This is Bloomberg. There is an epic saying in Italy when it comes to family generations that the first generation creates the second generation expands and the third generation destroys. And that's almost what happened in the Gucci story. So, hate and love together. Now I would have a much more experience about those who say that love you and then they trade you. The Gucci family was the strength but also the weakness of the label. The situation became dire with Gucci's finances. They were not able to pay salaries. They were not able to pay suppliers. Gucci is really teetering on the brink at this stage. A multi-trillion dollar industry. There's a lot of ground to cover. Come on, these got absolutely crushed.

17818," We are all united in our commitment to getting inflation back down to our 2% target. It's an open question of how far we are going to have to go with interest rates to bring that demand down into balance. We have raised interest rates a lot this year, so there's a lot of tightening in the pipeline. We have not felt the full effects yet, and yet inflation is still very high. Federal officials, Leo Kishari and Jim Bullard pushing back against market hopes for a pivot. Let's bring in James Acidine, the investment director, and everything that I have said, I'm going to make sense of it all. James, I look at some of the commentaries and some of the presentations, slight six from James Bullard and the sufficiently restrictive zone. The market is trying to understand how much more hawkish the last 12 hours have been for you. To be honest, I don't think significantly more hawkish at all. I think potentially the Fed looks at the reaction of markets in general, but risk assets in particular to their sort of shifting communication, but particularly to the missing CPI and potentially they're concerned that some of their work is being undone here. They just want to ensure that the language is still robust. There is still a coordinated commitment amongst committee members to push on the hawkish button, but that doesn't mean that the destination is necessarily a higher rate than where markets thought a week or two ago, or where was hinted by Jerome Powell following the last Fed meeting. So I think they're just trying to dampen investor spirits a little bit. It's all to play for when we get into next year, and it's likely that inflation continues to fall. We also had some comments out from Howard Marx from Oak Tree, who has a track record of injecting attention-grabbing headlines to the global market narrative every three to four months. So that is not new, but there is often truth within a lot of his statements. And I'm wondering whether you agree with his view that the real problem is not getting to 5%, it is staying at 5% for the next five to 10 years. Yeah, I mean, absolutely. I mean, if under that he's suggesting that part of the problem that we're facing has been caused by central bank policy being far too easy for far too long, and I would wholeheartedly agree. I think the problem that's been created, however, is one which is difficult to dismantle as easily as that, which is to say we've relied far too heavily on debt and debt growth to drive economic growth and financial markets have become far too addicted to central bank large s, via low and zero rates, but particularly by quantitative easing policies. And that has created fragility in the system. You now have a lot of debt out there. People say leverage is not that high. That's because obviously there's been a lot of nominal growth, and that does help. But there is still a lot of debt which needs servicing. And if we do find we're in a recession and we face lower inflation for a period, the nominal growth will come down. And so I do worry that in a 5% rates for three or four years would really create some challenges in the short term. But I do believe that ultimately there is virtue in having monetary policy set much more normally. James, getting inflation on the control depends on getting energy prices on the control. And we're seeing Brent a little bit weaker, but the market's life team is asking the bigger question, are we going to see Brent crude hit 60 or $100 a barrel first? And how is it going to affect risk assets? Yeah, I mean, I would never use unlike former Fed chair Ben Bernanke, I would never use the word control. There is absolutely and unequivocally no control going on here. Central banks have the ability to influence the margin. They do not have the ability and never have had the ability to control unless you've rightly said. Energy prices in particular are a significant driver of headline inflation, which are truly under nobody's control. The supply side arguments suggest we'll go to 100 first, the demand side arguments suggest we'll go to 61st. I.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,432,2022-11-18 05:20:51
17819," The supply side arguments suggest we'll go to 100 first. The demand side arguments suggest we'll go to 61st. I think in the end over the next sort of six months, probably the supply arguments are going to be more relevant and more powerful. So I do think we'll continue to see oil prices elevated, and less really until we get past winter first, but until we get some resolution in the Russia Ukraine situation, I don't think there's going to be a huge willingness amongst investors to sell oil aggressively. When you sit down with some of the stakeholders of Aberdeen asset management, James, what is likely to be the focus of some of the asset allocation ideas and how do you navigate the journey towards December 31 and as we roll into 2023? Yeah, so obviously I mean up to December is it it's a short time horizon for thinking about asset allocation. I think most sort of investors are thinking about just managing risks and liquidity and you know, US dollar stresses over the turn. It tends to be a period where activity declines, but looking into next year, I think there are some really interesting asset allocation conversations to be had. The bonds are as cheap relative to equities as they have been in many, many years depending on which metric you use you could be talking about. Cheapness that we haven't seen since the crash of 1987. That's really not been part of the conversation for so long bonds have been really pilloried by lots of asset allocators. They've been described as returnless risk for many years and what we've seen in the last 12 months as to some degree justified those concerns and those criticisms. That's not the case as we sit here today. The S&P is trading off price earnings ratio of maybe 19 times current earnings, maybe 17 times future earnings, whereas bonds look much more attractive on an absolute basis. And if we're right and suggesting the inflation will come lower next year, they're going to look more attractive from both the real carry and a duration perspective. So we think there's going to be some asset allocation flows into bonds for sure next year. This has been hugely insightful. Thanks for the time that Sir James Athe, the Investment Director at Aberdeen Asset Management, much more to come. This is Bloomberg. There's more activity in the fusion world than ever. In not just in government research labs, there's also an emerging private fusion industry that attracted billions of dollars in capital in recent years. Governments and private investors alike realize that we've got to find a solution that's going to allow us to get to net zero targets. This is one of the hardest but most rewarding problems that humanity could work on. Ultimately we all want the same thing. We want someone to put electricity on the grid from a fusion power station as quickly as possible. Frankly, the scale of the challenge, 3000 gigawatts of fossil fuel to replace. There's not many things that can do that. In fact, there may only be fusion that can really do that. And while many in the scientific community predict fusion power will take decades, some in the private fusion space, believe we'll get there in just a few years, as soon as the 2030s.

Despite rising tensions trade with the US and Europe is crucial for China. That's according to the veteran emerging market investor, Mark Mollbyus, he spoke to Bloomberg earlier. You look at the Chinese economy. It's dependent upon trade, particularly with the US and Europe. So he really has no choice but to engage with these leaders and say nice words. But at the end of the day, you must remember that he's threatened to take Taiwan by force. And that would be, it would mean war with the United States, in my view. How real is that risk, do you think, Mark? I think it's very real. I mean, it's very clearly stated. It's a goal that is, it may not happen overnight, but I think it's something hanging over our heads. The solution, of course, would be for China to come out and say, look, we would like to have a combination with Taiwan, but we will never use force. It will be up to the Taiwanese people. That would be a great statement to make and it would relax the investors around the world. And people will want to go back into China. Well, given the very complicated geopolitics, the risks you see of escalation, Mark, do you want to touch anything? Are you willing to touch any investment in China or given that risk? Is it uninvestable? We are investing in a company in Hong Kong, which is part of China, of course, now. So that's the some degree of risk control in the sense that we've limited the amount that we have in China. So we're not ignoring it completely, but to put, let's say, the market weight. You must remember the emerging markets indices have 20, 30% in China. We certainly never want to go to that high degree. So I think this is something that we have to watch carefully and limit and put the money into Taiwan. I think that's where the opportunities are. And we think there's a better chance there, particularly in companies that are doing software. We're working with. I was just about to go there, Mark, because we had warned Buffett pouring about $5 billion into TSMC. Is that the type of trade you're interested in? Exactly. Well, we're more interested in, and we've been interested for the last three four years. In companies in Taiwan that are doing the software, the design for semiconductors, that TSMC manufacturers. So they depend on TSMC for the manufacturers side, but they're doing the software. The good news for these companies is that they can move anywhere in the world. If something happens in Taiwan, they can move to the United States, they can move to Europe and say pavements, and that their people can move as well. So that's the way we sort of control the possible risk of an attack on Taiwan by China. And within the emergency markets, let me take you to the Middle East, where we are facing the last trading session of the week for Dubai and Abu Dhabi on Friday. But this was the state of play late Thursday for the Saudi Tadaule. That was the fourth weekly loss. The lower energy prices causing a little bit of anxiety. And so what you saw is a considerable amount of profit taking. In Dubai was the Dubai Electricity and Water Authority that weighed. Stocked down 2.1%. Generally, though, it's been a sideways trade for the DFM. Let's flip the board and get to your equity futures. On this Friday, we are marginally lower as we continue to digest the Fed commentary.

And 12 years after being awarded the tournament Qatar's world cup is nearing upon nearly upon us kicking off the Sunday we look at just what the Gulf state is getting for its reported $300 billion spend. Let's circle back to the markets in Asia. Annabelle Drillers joins us from Hong Kong. Last time it was announced in which a August contest lasted at a standard technical point asked to say it the moment of the Q&A Race and what's become more dominant for us in Asia today is the outlook in China. And specifically, there's optimism that we're going to continue to see that easing around COVID-0 restrictions. So we've got the likes of Al Yiminium, cotton, steel all moving high today. And then also what's happening in the FX space is where we're looking a little bit risk on in the Chinese Yuan, for instance, also other risk sensitive commodity link currencies. They've been high throughout the session. It's also really coming out in the China tech space. If you just change on now, take a look where Alibaba is trading into the afternoon session. We saw gains as much as 6% at the open here, but basically investors liking what the company had to say about the outlook for the virus in China, essentially that perhaps the country is starting to learn to live with it, at least in some degree. And then you can add to that there were plans for a further share byback program. So that has...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,435,2022-11-18 05:34:04
17822," in some degree and then you can enter that they were plans for a further share by that program. So that has really used to have lifted sentiment in that sector today. And then there's also new Goldman Sachs. Let's see with China because they're more optimistic about the Altaqood economies. That right? Yeah, that's right. So a new note out, essentially they've upgraded their outlook, particularly around Hong Kong. So that went from a market-weight to a rather underweight to market-weight. But essentially what they're expecting for the CSI 300 over the coming 12 months of gains of as much as 16%. That's also what they're expecting for the MSCI China Index. The other sector that they're also bullish on is what's happening in Korea as well. So both of these markets, what's interesting is that they were really laggards during 2022, but they said them outperforming in the coming year. But if you change on now, Goldman Sachs also looking at the outlook for Southeast Asia, essentially Southeast Asia is going to be underperforming. They say in 2023, so downgrades for Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia. And also India, they're bullish there, you said, on the longer term outlook, but still they're a little bit concerned about the cost of stocks there. Yeah, we'll continue to watch it closely. Anavale, thank you for that. Anavale droolers, Brent Crude in the meantime, dip below $90 barrel overnight. For the first time since October, on global demand concerns. And it comes despite Saudi Arabia cutting oil exports sharply this month. It's the Kingdom delivers on the OPEC plus agreement. Let's get to Fadiq Bahisi, head of Middle East strategy at Credit Suisse. But you had the US arguing something and then the Saudi view was very different. And we had this political spat between the two now with energy prices and crude falling below $90 barrel. Despite the Saudis cutting, just shy of half a million barrels a day, that vindicates the Saudi viewpoint, doesn't it? To an extent it does. I mean, there's definitely growth concerns that are weighing on oil prices right now. I don't think the market is focusing so much on US and Saudi politics anymore, because I think a lot of the issues related to that are a little bit more behind us now. And the focus is really shifting a lot more to the growth outlook, especially for the US and China. Nevertheless, if you look over the next one or two months, we do still think there's good upside to behind an oil. We are constructive on oil short term. We have turned positive on energy expecting it to outperform the broader commodities index mainly because we think there's a lot of risk of disruption coming in as Europe puts into place its embargo against Russian oil. And also the fact that you're heading into winter period, it could be a colder winter than normal and inventories are still pretty tight. So, we've said many times in the past, yes, there's still two-way risks because you've got the concerns over a growth slowdown coupled with the other issues I mentioned, but right now we think the bias is towards the upside on that. When I was looking through your research yesterday evening and this morning, one of the things that you were pointing out is how the crude windfall was flowing through the Saudi economy quite differently at this time around in some of the prior years. I'm wondering what the next catalyst is going to be for equities in particular. Is it going to be on the foreign ownership side? I think that's definitely one of the triggers. There is an expectation from investors that at some point, Saudi could well look at raising foreign ownership, living more and encourage greater ownership in the market and also effectively materially increase its weight in the emerging market benchmark. And that will be a driver for another sort of phase of foreign inflows. And it frankly makes a lot of sense given how under owned Saudi Arabia is given its sheer size in the emerging market benchmark. I mean, we're looking at what a 6, 7 percent weight in the index versus maybe like a 2 percent weight in most emerging market portfolios. It's massively underweight. But I mean, that's just going to be more like a nice thing on the cake for us. I mean, the real driver of growth and the reason why we're long term excited about Saudi is the growth prospect that it offers. The foreign ownership thing is simply an added bonus.

17823," and specifically about how a vacant palm island shows the risks of the luxury property boom. As we get into 2023 and as the impact of higher interest rates works itself through the cycle, is there material downside and should investors work around that? We are concerned about downside risk to real estate prices, but it's a much more differentiated, more segmented market than it has been, a lot more mature than it has been. When we look at the luxury end, I'm not making too much of a call on that because I think the drivers for that are quite idiosyncratic and that could remain more well supported for longer than the rest of the market. It kind of operates in its own little world, but I think the mass market, your budget and your mid-range is really where our focus is. Between the two, we are more concerned about the mid-range market, which is where it has re-rated quite significantly. We feel that pricing is now moving a little bit out of reach for the end demographic, the end-target market. That's where we think there is a concern of prices correcting. The budget end hasn't really rallied anywhere near as much, so that's probably not a lot of ground to lose. But we do think that maybe a quarter or a third of the gains that we've seen in this cycle could be lost, but it is a much more different cycle than what we've seen in the previous two or three cycles, where you saw the entirety of gains wiped out. We are still a good 50% below previous peaks. Are you planning to attend the World Cup if you've gotten some tickets? Potentially, yeah. How does that kind of translate to some of your calls on the country? Because as much as you might be bullish on being there, you're actually not as bullish about some of the valuations and the proposition vis-a-vis some of the other opportunities. Well, I've never been a huge fan of playing in a market for these one-off events, but the Olympics will be at the World Cup because in my experience, they never really deliver the kind of returns that you might expect. There's certainly, I'm not saying that there wasn't a story to be had. It was a key driver of growth for Qatar, and in Qatar's case, it was a little bit different, but we're not hugely pivoting towards playing the World Cup. I do think short-term Dubai could well see a stock market reaction because it is, I think, economically very well geared to the impact of the World Cup, and it will absolutely benefit during its peak tourism season, but it's not something we would be chasing at this stage. And we've done a little bit of tour of the region, and that's based on the research that your team has done, so I don't want to get Egypt in here as well, where you have now shifted your call away from being originally very cautious to now saying, it's the right time to get it. Yeah, it's definitely a bit more of a cautious optimism than it has been in the past because the government really does need to deliver on its IMF program. But I do think it's definitely a good time to take a look. Between the sort of the the table market, the 12 month tables and the equities, I do think the risk will pay off is a bit more attractive on tables, because you're getting a good 18% on those tables, I think the downside risk to the EGP is actually quite limited. Our target is, our six to 12 month target is 22, which entails a little bit of strengthening from where we are. Equities, they've rallied, they've rallied very well. I think this potential for it to go a little further, maybe exceed the 13,000 mark. I'd be very surprised if we got as high as 14,000 right now. It's going to, but equities really needs to see an actual delivery on these policies and an improvement in the economic activity. So I think that's going to be a bit more of a longer term story than it is on the on the tables. Great catching up. Thank you very much. Which match are you attending? Quarters potentially. Okay. Alright, keep me in mind if you need somebody to tag along, that's a five-eight ball. He's the head of Middle East Strategy at Crit Swiss. So much for it to come. This is Bloomberg.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,437,2022-11-18 05:42:49
17824," too Smart We're in the early stages of a sustainability revolution that has the magnitude of the industrial revolution coupled with the speed of the digital revolution. Nobody covers climate change like Bloomberg, your global business authority. Twelve years after being awarded the tournament, Kantá's World Cup is Nínyá Pána. It's the most expensive World Cup ever and the world will be watching. Not just for action on the field, but for potential trouble around human rights. Simone Foxman joins us now from outside the Elbate Stadium in Káters. Simone, the event has been plagued by controversy ever since Káters won the bid. How's the government responding? Well it's really the chance for local officials to show that they are outward facing. They want everyone to come here, it's going to be safe for everyone to come here and that people are going to enjoy being in Káters. The government has made some changes with respect to things like worker rights. They've improved the baseline standards for accommodation, for safety at construction sites and they've even imposed some rules that would allow workers to change jobs, workers of all sort of stature in society. All set activists say they really could do more, but this isn't the only controversy we're seeing. We've also seen activists push back about the lack of freedoms for LGBTQ people, for women, and to free expression. And then we've been talking about the allegation that this is a net zero carbon neutral World Cup that's largely been discredited by activists. So I think there's going to continue to be a lot of flat coming at the country, whether that changes when we get excitement on the pitch, I think that remains to be seen. So why don't you run us through a chronology of events in terms of what comes up next? Yeah, well, we'll have an opening ceremony here on Sunday starting around 1 p.m., 4 p.m. Excuse me. And then later in the evening, we'll get the initial kickoff between a Qatar and Ecuador. We'll have about two weeks of group stage matches and then we'll get into kind of a knockout rounds with the final on December 18th. But what happens after that is a sort of really big question mark, right? Because we're going to see this influx of fans up to 1.2 million people in a country with a population of 3 million over the course of the next month. But then they leave. And it's really unclear exactly what happens to Qatar after that. Does it use this experience to try and catapult itself as a tourist hub? Certainly the intention, but easier said than done. Does it newly draw business people, others to invest money in the country? Those are outstanding questions that we don't have, but we do expect certainly the population of low income workers to leave, but a lot of the population of white color workers to leave as well. So as Qatar tries to chart its path forward to a knowledge economy, a service sector economy at the moment, the link between holding a major world cup and what happens next, still a little bit unclear. So, moment, thank you for that. We'll be counting down to kick off on Sunday to go. That's someone Fox about to al-Bate stadium in Qatar. Now, being an adventure capitalist, Tim Draper says the collapse of FTX was predicted.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,438,2022-11-18 05:47:07
17825," kickoff on Sunday together. That's a one-flock spent the albate stadium in Qatar. Now, being an adventure capitalist, Tim Draper says the collapse of FTX was predictable because the platform was very centralized where bad things can happen. But he told Bloomberg he's actually sticking with his prediction that Bitcoin will hit $250,000. Well, we've always been so excited about Bitcoin because it's decentralized and a token where FTX was very centralized. It was all centered around this one guy. And when you centralize anything, bad things can happen. I mean, Putin is a centralized dictator of Russia and he went to war. She is a centralized dictator of China and he locked down all of Shanghai. These centralized decisions are not healthy. And that's why Bitcoin was so good. It wasn't a central bank. The money wasn't coming from any central source. It was decentralized and open. And all these copycats that went off and created similar things didn't think in terms of decentralizing. And so FTX was predictable. We turned down FTX twice at Draper Associates. You bring up a very good point. This is trust. And you know, you look at some of the fallout, minimum, of course, your point there. A lot of it is down to trust. You know, the clients withdrawing their money. There's a liquidity squeeze then for some of these other players. Then what do you think needs to happen to restore that trust? I think it's time. And I think trust in centralized currencies should have a little bit of an eye toward things could go wrong. But decentralized currencies, I mean, there, you don't want to trust centralized systems. Decentralized systems work. It's going to bar your analogy, though. I mean, within this world of decentralization, for example, the issue also is there are, to your point, monarchies within this. FTX is a very good example of that. As an industry player, how do you address that then? So as an industry player, I am looking to invest in things that are decentralized. I think there are big opportunities in anything that looks like it has the opportunity to be decentralized. I think like the DAO's, the DAO's are going to be extraordinary for humankind. They're going to sort of bring us through an anthropological leap forward. I kind of like those. I like what's happening in smart contracts around Bitcoin. I think those are very exciting because they're going to make it so we don't need as much legal service. We can actually have most of those contracts built into software. And I like what's happening around the blockchain. I know it's 250,000. That's your call in Bitcoin. When do you think it gets there? And why? And I'm wearing my Bitcoin tie. And the reason it gets to 250,000 and probably beyond is that it will take a moment when you can buy your food, your clothing, and your shelter all in Bitcoin. And here are the statistics that I know. Women control 80% of retail spending. And that's usually the food, the clothing, and the shelter. And women only have, well, way back when it was like one in 14 Bitcoin wallets and now it's one in six. And when women realize that they can get a discount by paying in Bitcoin, when retailers, retailers realize they can double their profits by accepting Bitcoin, it's going to move pretty quickly. I got to ask you, your personal wealth, how much without giving away too much details, how much of that is actually in crypto and not so much in FIA? So most of it is in most of it's in crypto. Most of it's in Bitcoin and a lot of it's in a couple of other currencies.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,439,2022-11-18 05:51:20
17826," So most of it is in most of it's in crypto. Most of it's in Bitcoin and a lot of it's in in a couple of other currencies but they're the decentralized ones. They're like Tezos and others. Very little in centralized currencies and a lot in startups. Arguably some controversial calls there from the draper and associates founder at Tim Draper. We said much better to come on the show. This is Bloomberg. No one covers the world like Bloomberg. My team thinks 2023 we avoid a recession. I'm a little more skeptical about that. China and the US both do not want to see nuclear force in the European continent. The regulators here in the Bahamas are ongoing with their investigation into FTX. With unmatched reach and resources from more than 120 countries the moment news breaks 24 hours a day. Bloomberg your global business authority. A multi trillion dollar industry there's a lot of ground to cover. Come on these got absolutely crushed. We'll show you what's happening in ETFs like no one else. Bloomberg ETF IQ Monday on Bloomberg. The final day of COP27 and nations are still no closer to reaching a deal. Let's get out to Bloomberg's Jennifer Sampasajah who joins us from the summit of China. Jen time flies but little progress has been made and you can understand that given how many stakeholders are involved but where do negotiations stand? Yeah I mean use it right now the negotiations are not going that well especially when you think about where we're at right now in this this two week summit because with less than 24 hours to go there's still no concrete deal and there still appears to be a deadlock on a number of key issues and we heard that from UN Secretary General Antonio Gutierrez who gave us a bit of a peak inside how these discussions are going when he said there's clearly a breakdown in trust between North and South and between developed and emerging economies and really the divisions are between some of these key issues you said that we've been talking about over the past few days. Mitigation adaptation climate finance and notably loss and damage and you were just taking a look at one potential breakthrough that we saw on Thursday from the EU which put forward friends Timmerman Timmermans put forward a proposal to potentially support loss and damage with some of these emerging economies but it's unclear whether or not this is actually going to be the breakthrough that people are hoping for and so there's still a lot to pay attention to you, sir. I mean in terms of where the bar is at for it to constitute the positive outcome at COP where is that bar, Jen? I believe based on the conversations that we've been having here that there needs to be some sort of action some sort of new funding finance facility that we see coming out of these negotiations but as we've heard from you know the COP27 president from UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres there's still a lot of divisions between what exactly that would look like and when these would start and that could become ultimately the hold up in any sort of progress in these issues but on the one promising side you know we have seen a number of pledges that have been made.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,440,2022-11-18 05:55:41
17827," come ultimately the hold up in any sort of progress in these issues. But on the one promise inside, we have seen a number of pledges that have been made, a number of nations that have joined on to the global methane pledge, which of course we know is important when we talk about reducing global emissions. But there still needs to be some sort of action for activists and really a lot of developing economies to actually consider this to be the COP4 Africa, which everyone was touting and the COP about implementation, because at this point we're not seeing that. And there's a few hours to go. So we're really going to be paying attention to what is in the document, what is in that cover document, and what are the details of what these countries are going to potentially be getting support for. Jen, excellent reporting. Thank you for that. That's Jennifer Zabazajah at the COP27 summit in Egypt. We have some lines coming through around the North Korean missile launch. This is a reaction from the United States from Kamala Harris, the Vice President saying that the launch is quote, a brazen violation of UN resolutions. Harris is met with allies on the APEC sidelines. We also have comments from the Japanese Prime Minister saying that the launch is quote utterly unacceptable and we'll see how much diplomatic momentum some of these calls get over the next few hours at the United Nations more broadly. I'm also looking at the story that is getting a lot of interest from our global audience around the Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, who as we understand it can't be sued in the U.S. over the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi because of as a head of government he's immune. This is something the Biden administration has told a judge. The U.S. government has expressed grave concerns over the killing of Jamal Khashoggi and has raised this with the highest level of the Saudi government. But as Prime Minister, he cannot be sued in the jurisdiction of the United States District Court in this particular suit. So that opinion coming through from the U.S. government and his response to the lawsuit that has been filed by the fiance of Jamal Khashoggi. I want to take you back to the markets and it is a story of, well, a look for direction as it were. We're barely below the flatline here on the S&P 500 mini a little bit higher on the Nasdaq futures. We had that James Bullard really at the top of a long list of Fed speakers that are delivering a more hawkish tilt to their outlook. At the same time economic data that allows for various interpretations. So this is kind of what we're looking at. The coverage will continue from London to the rest of the world on this Friday. This is Bloomberg. These floating flowers are made of 92,000 solar panels. Nade on the surface of a reservoir, they can generate 41 megawatts, which is enough to power 20,000 homes.

This one in particular has healthy local economy. When the power plant was first proposed, residents were given the chance to invest. Some locals were also offered jobs during construction. In fact, it was the community that requested the panels to be shaped as flowers to look more appealing. South Korea has to rely heavily on imported fossil fuels, but will need to change that to reach its goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2050. Solar plants like this one may help the country reach its net zero goals. Bank of America. When US jobs numbers are released, Bloomberg brings you crucial data at terminal speed and instant expert analysis. Nobody covers jobs day like Bloomberg. This is Bloomberg, David Europe. I'm Tom McKenzie in London and these are the stories that set your agenda. Raising the stakes, Wall Street closes in the red as James Bullard upcyanity on his view of Fed hikes. But Asia stocks push higher, let again, by tech. Leak reality, UK Chancellor Jeremy Hunt lays out a harsh economic future of weak growth and rising taxes as Britain's face a record drop in living standards. Plus, unprecedented chaos, the man overseeing the ruins of FTX reveals a quote, complete failure of corporate controls as the full and digital empire. This as Twitter faces an exodus of remaining employees under Elon Musk. So we check in on the futures then on the back of just increased numbers of officials coming out of the Fed, particularly Bullard. And it is Bullard who is suggesting now that you could see rates of between five and 5.25 percent in terms of the terminal rate from the Federal Reserve at the minimum was the line there from James Bullard. But joining a chorus, as I said, as a Fed officials pushing back on some of the narratives within these markets around any kind of pause, there will need to be further rate hikes. And that terminal rate keeps being pushed out and pushed higher by these Fed officials. We wait, of course, for the update on the dot plots later this month. Meanwhile, of course, we continue to look ahead to what's happening with the ECB. Our reporting suggesting they're moving closer to 50 basis points later this month. We do have Madam Gleard speaking later today. Euro dollar currently at 103 again, of a tenth of a percent for the single currency. The 10 year at 367 376, so say the benchmark, Brent at $90 a barrel. That is again of seven cents of a percent. But you are looking potentially a week of losses for Brent traders not showing a lot of demand for oil again on concerns about where we're going in terms of potential recession, the slowdown and growth, Bitcoin 16,800. That's again, of just seven cents of a percent again on the back of additional details coming out of the fallout of FTX and SBF, Sam Bankman, free. Now, Asia stocks are on track for a weekly gain, Bloomberg's Annabelle droolers is tracking the moves for us in Hong Kong. Annabelle, certainly Alibaba, part of the mix as well in Asia. Yeah, that's really actually the big sentiment for us today, Tom. Given that we didn't have those earnings out, so yes, there was that proper beat. But really what's driving the sentiment today are those other big incentives that were thrown to investors. So first there was that shared buyback, that's number one. But then the other is that the company says that it's actually starting to see perhaps some optimism around an easing of code restrictions. Some sense perhaps that the country is also learning to live with COVID, at least to some degree, even as we see cases that rising back to the highest levels of the stock.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,442,2022-11-18 06:04:25
17829," Restrictions, some sense perhaps that the country is also learning to live with COVID, at least to some degree, even as we see cases that rising back to the highest levels of the start of the pandemic, and a real test for officials in terms of what they plan to do. So that is the state of play that we have for Alibaba today, up around 2.5% now, though, did earlier pop as much as 6% at the start of trade and certainly lifting the broader index. Have you changed on now? Really, the optimism in Asia today that we're seeing is based on COVID- zero policies and any sort of easing here. If you take a look at what we're seeing in other other benchmarks today, we are looking moderately higher, particularly for what we're seeing in the Hang Seng today. As you said, on track for a weekly again here for the broader MSCI Asia Pacific index, Goldman Sachs as well upgrading their outlooks for China and Korea. So certainly that's the main trading sentiment, not so much the Fed Tom. Yeah, interesting that upgrade from Goldman Sachs. Anabel Drupal is excellent. Thank you very much indeed. Let's get to our reporters from around the world. Then Ender Curran joins us from Hong Kong for a look at the latest noises from Fed officials. John Sterpek has our UK autumn statement breakdown. And finally, we have got the latest on crypto and FTX from Stacey Marie Ishmael in Singapore. Now, let's start with Ender Curran then. Fed officials continue making the case for further rate hikes. As I mentioned, to combat the hottest inflation in decades, Ender Curran has the breakdown. Ender, we are hearing a course from James Bullard raising his view of 5.25 percent between 5 and 5.25 percent. At the minimum, it seems like further hikes and big hikes are still in the cards for these Fed officials. Yeah, yet more hawkish comments from these officials, Tom, as you say, Mr Bullard making the point of that's the kind of zone where he thinks the Fed fund rate needs to end up similar being five and five and a quarter. He's not yet satisfied that the rate hikes have had so far this year between almost up to 400 basis points. It is not yet having the impact he wants it to have. Now, those comments were sum up back up by Neil Kishkari, the other Fed official who spoke overnight and he made the point that he's also not satisfied with inflation where it's at. He didn't put a figure on where he sees the terminal rate, but he says they have a lot more work to do. And these comments jowler with the signal from Chairman Jerome Pyle, don't forget when he said a few weeks ago, he thinks the Fed rate might end up hard and people expect. He would marry daily this week coming out with a range, high ranges maybe 40 quarters, five, five and a quarter from the Fed fund rate. So, we're not at a point where there's some debate over sure what pace of rate hikes will be from here, but the core point is that interest rates are still going up and they might ultimately settle at a point that is higher than money economists were expecting as recently as only a few months ago. So the core message is the Fed still has a lot more work to do. Bluebirds, End of Current, thank you very much indeed. The benchmark US 10 you currently at 375. Let's get back to what's happening in the UK then. The Chancellor, Jeremy Hunt laid out a very bleak new reality for the country's economy in his autumn statement. One plagued by wheat growth and rising taxes for years to come. For more, we're joined by Bloomberg's John Stappec and John breakdown the Chancellor's budget for us. What really stood out for you? Well, it was very much a budget to half-storm. On the one hand, as we would actually discuss in yesterday, all of us are going to be paying significantly more tax. Most of that's been done through a mechanism called Fiscal Drag, which is where tax thresholds are frozen so that more people over time are dragged into them by natural inflation. A couple of minor tax changes like the top-rate attacks was brought down from 150,000 pounds to just over 125,000 and their dividend taxes and their capital gains tax allowances were also slashed. On the other hand, what was particularly interesting is that for all that we've talked about the gloom and it is gloomy, it's like this a gloomy outlook. Much of the pains actually been postponed. So, although there was a lot of talk of austerity and spending cuts before this budget, over the next two years, there's actually going to be increased spending. Most of that kind of the cuts have been delayed until after her coincidentally enough the next election. So, what you have to think here is that the chance of priority was to make sure that markets were kept happy so that mortgage rates don't spike and then after we go through the pin of next year.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,443,2022-11-18 06:08:49
17830," and then after we go through the pain of next year, you have to think he's kind of got his fingers crossed that perhaps things won't be quite as bad as feared and perhaps some of this can be unwound about markets and the less fair-brow condition. And of course... Backloading of the pain. John Steppeck, thank you for breaking down the autumn statement for us. You can read more of John's analysis and tips as well in terms of what is happening with the UK. How that budget may affect you and your finances. At the Bloomberg UK Newsletter, it is money distilled. Check it out on Bloomberg.com and on the terminal. Now, FTX's new boss, John J. Ray, who previously oversaw the liquidation of none other than N-ron, has revealed the chaos left behind by Sam Bankman-Freed. Ray said that, quote, in my career, have I seen such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information. And that, of course, from the man who oversaw the mess that was N-ron. Now, with more on this story, we have Bloomberg's managing editor, for Crypto Stacey Marie Ishmael at a Singapore Stacey Marie. What is the latest then on the fallout from FTX on a daily basis we're getting updates? What do we know at this point? I think one of the big things that we know at this point is how worrying it is that the FTX folks themselves, how little they knew about what was going on, especially in the last couple of days before they filed for bankruptcy. And that has a couple of potential consequences. The first is that creditors to FTX people who had invested with them, people who were trading with them, people who otherwise had exposure to the platform, don't feel very reassured that they're going to be able to get any of their money back, given the kinds of statements that you just alluded to. I think the second is that across crypto folks are asking, well, hang on a minute, this was a company that, an a set of companies that presented themselves as the responsible ones in the room. They would say things like, you know, we're the best regulated or the most regulated crypto exchange in the world. And Sandbank Winfrey had a lot of relationships in various jurisdictions, including the U.S. with legislators, lawmakers, regulators, people who are trying to set the stage for what crypto regulation should look like. And it's becoming increasingly clear that none of those conversations seem to have had any sort of preventative effects in terms of consumer protection for the industry. And what do we know, uh, states and Maria, about the about the linkages at this point between FTX.com, FTX, U.S. and other parts of this kind of sprawling SBF empire. And indeed, the linkages between that empire and the broader financial sector. Yeah, I think the sprawling part is really key. You know, one of the things that has happened in the past couple of days is there is a dispute-vire lawyers between the folks in the Bahamas, or the Bahamas government, the Bahamas regularly, and the folks overseeing the liquidation of the Bahamas-registered FTX entities, and the folks who are overseeing the liquidation of the entities that were based and exposed to the U.S. And so that confusion suggests like that there was a lot of interlinkages, even though Sandbank Winfrey and others who represented FTX would say over and over again, no, these are totally hands-off relationships, there's no connections here. And you know, my colleagues at Bloomberg have reported extensively going back several months that those assertions were never really supported by the facts that we could see. I think in terms of the broader financial system, I mean, you said at the beginning that Bitcoin prices somewhat confusingly are still positive over the past couple of days. And I think that's because there's still a perception that in as much as this is a mess, it's fairly well contained within crypto right now. We're not seeing a lot of spillover into other markets. Bloomberg, Stacy, Marie, Ishmael, thank you. Excellent. And really fantastic reporting as well on the terminal and on Bloomberg.com on this subject, including our own conversations with SBF before all of this unfolded, really eye-opening stuff as well. Right, earlier this week, Elon Musk issued an ultimatum to Twitter employees. He said, either commit to the company's new quote, hardcore work environment or leave. Well, the deadline has now passed. And sources tell Bloomberg that so many more workers have chosen to go than he expected that major complications are now resulting. Sukinen has more. Sources inside Twitter report new levels of chaos and confusion and say that Twitter's offices in San Francisco aren't doing they don't need it, they pull out too many obvious comments.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,444,2022-11-18 06:13:19
17831," resulting Succanan Hasmore. Sources inside Twitter report new levels of chaos and confusion and say that Twitter's offices in San Francisco are now closed until Monday. This after the new billionaire owner, Elon Musk, put out an effective put up or shut up ultimatum to staff, telling them to either commit to working long hours at high intensity, and there's been talk of 80 hour work weeks, or to leave it except a three month severage package. Sources say so many more people than expected opted to leave and decline must pledge that it potentially puts Twitter's operations at risk. A memo seen by Bloomberg also urges staff to refrain from discussing confidential information on social media or elsewhere. And some employees who were leaving speculated that so many are now departing along with their knowledge of how the product works, that the social media network may have trouble fixing or updating systems during its normal operations. Of course, things were also complicated by a possible national security review of Musk's $44 billion deal by U.S. government officials, that's according to people close to the matter. Musk consummated his deal to take Twitter private at the end of October, and there have been multiple problems and headlines ever since. Bloomberg Sukinen in New York. OK, Bloomberg's Sukinen there on the latest at Twitter. I couldn't help but notice that Elon Musk's one of his most recent tweets was a picture of a gravestone with the Twitter logo on it. Right, coming up, the Fed's Bullard signals rate rises will roll on more on that next, the context for these markets. And coming up later in the show, we have Google's global head of government affairs and public policy, Karen Batia. He'll be joining us live from the APEC economic leaders meeting in Bangkok. This is Bloomberg. What do you think of when you think of a battery? For most, it's what we use to power devices for both work and play, and maybe even your car. Over the past few decades, they've gotten way more powerful, long-lasting, and affordable. But all of this is just a prologue to what the next batteries are going to do. As we drive to an increasingly renewable power driven grid, we also need to be able to store energy and release it later to cover those periods of weather intermittencies that are driving this new grid that we're in. It's a multi-trillion dollar opportunity, and it's imperative that we figure out the solution here. How we store energy on a massive scale is in many ways the central challenge of the fight to stop climate change. You will shed light on dark matter. You will make aging optional. Because when you subscribe to Bloomberg, you won't just get news. You will get insight into limitless possibilities. Before you change the world, Bloomberg. Top names at the Fed are on Bloomberg. I think it will probably be appropriate soon to move to a slower pace of increases, but we have additional work to do. Nobody covers the Fed like Bloomberg.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,445,2022-11-18 06:17:23
17832," Even under these generous assumptions, the policy rate still isn't at a zone that might be considered sufficiently restrictive. To get to this sufficiently restrictive level of policy will need to increase the policy rate further. We are all united in our commitment to getting inflation back down to our 2% target. It's an open question of how far we are going to have to go with interest rates to bring that demand down into balance. We have raised interest rates a lot this year so there's a lot of tightening in the pipeline. We have not felt the full effects yet and yet inflation is still very high. Fed officials Neil Kashkary and Jim Bullard pushing back against market hopes for a pivot. Joining us today to unpack some of this is Perutia sign by G10 FX strategy at BNP Barrier by markets at 360. Perutia good morning. Thank you for joining us. How much more work do these markets have to do to price in a plus 5% terminal rate? Well, there certainly needs to be more that can be priced and that for that exact reason. We think the dollar can reach in and unwind some of the moves that we've seen over the past few weeks. We've heard from many of Fed speakers Bullard particularly overnight and they all seem to be singing from the same him sheet. Yes, the pace of hikes may need to slow but we are not quite at the level yet where we can say we've reached the peak terminal rate. For us, we do think that is 5.25% which is similar to the minimum level that Bullard's been alluding to overnight and we think that will be reached in Q1. So yes, we may get the downshift to 50 basis points in December but ultimately the path is still a little bit higher and it's more than what market's are pricing in. Okay, so 5 and a quarter percent is your view for the first quarter. How much ballast does that give the US dollar? The yield advantage for the US and what that does for the greenback in the quarters ahead, Beresha? So I think there's two things we need to consider. One is that the markets need to reprice in these higher interest rates and that will we think the supportive for the dollar, especially given the yield advantage will be continuing to increase with the Fed continuing to raise rates but secondly, we also think that markets will increasingly be pricing in the impending downturn that's to come. Certainly getting interest rates up to these levels is not going to come without a cost and that cost is likely to be a recession coming through the course of next year and we don't think that fundamental risk is being priced in to risk assets like equities like credit and so as markets move to pricing in that risk as the data continues to turn. We do think that will give the dollar some more support via safe haven demand. So for the next three to six months we do see the dollar as stronger for longer but thereafter we do still expect a pivot as that peak yield advantage kind of reaches that that key top level and starts to pivot as we go through the course of the second half of next year. And you're quite clear that that pivot comes through from central banks in the first quarter of next year so my question then is when in terms of timing what do you want to be thinking about in terms of positioning for a potential bond rally do you have to wait until the first quarter until it's in it's baked in that that pivot or can you start to position a little earlier. So we think that we will have to wait until Q1 I think one because of the fact that central bank policy is still going to be rising up until the end of Q1 we think and the second is also there's a significant amount of supply with hitting markets particularly I would say more so in Europe which is typical of the cycle but until that supply is out of the way we think it will be hard for yields to be falling or rally for bonds to rally in that environment so it's after we get over that Q1 peak when policy rates are at their terminal levels almost the supply is out of the way we think that will mark the shift or the path for bonds to rally certainly more so than equities will be performing next year. Okay and switching focus to the ECB we have reporting from Bloomberg today suggesting that officials there at the central bank in Frankfurt are considering edging down in terms of the next height from 75 to 50 basis points later in December. What would that do do that push the euro is that pushing the euro back below below parity. So we do see risks of the euro heading back towards parity levels over the Q1.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,446,2022-11-18 06:21:52
17833," Is that pushing the euro back below parity? So we do see risks of the euro heading back towards parity levels over the course of the next few months. I wouldn't necessarily say that it will be ECB driven though. Certainly if we look at the inflation data, we've had inflation surprisingly upside, even more recently the inflation expectations data for the long term has also been on the rise. And we think then that could call into question some of the dovish tweaks that we've seen from the ECB at their last meeting and maybe suggesting that there's a downshift could have been a little bit premature. So I think going into the December meeting, it's going to be a fine balance. We are calling for 50 basis points of rate hike, so getting that downshift, but certainly we wouldn't be surprised if we saw another 75 from them. But really the key reason why we could get a retest of parity in your dollar is going to be this dollar drive, this dollar move higher we think that will emerge over the coming months driven by safe haven demand, driven by fed repricing higher with terminal expectations perhaps being revised higher again from the fed at their December meeting. Okay, when we look at the UK, the autumn statement of yesterday, obviously central to what the chancellor was trying to achieve was trying to convince the markets that credibility has now been restored. Were you and with a team at BNP convinced and what do you expect to see in terms of the risk premium within UK assets? Completely agreed that the clear statement from the budget was to come across as being more credible. Certainly we've had a quarter to more to us last few weeks in UK politics. So that was definitely the sign that was needed that definitely came across. Arguably you could say the pendulum has shifted quite significantly from one of fiscal easing under Liz Truss's government to now want a fiscal tightening under Rishi Sunax. So clearly that message come across that is a good sign for markets, but a lot of that was arguably being priced in as soon as Rishi Sunax took his place as Prime Minister. There was already that confidence or feeling that we will have a more stable government, and we will have a more fiscally prudent government than we had previously. So that's why we didn't see a significant reaction yesterday to the budget. But also I think we also need to unpack a couple of details here which is growth expectations from the OBR are quite punchy. Certainly there are around five percentage points high in the water bank of England would be looking for. There are around two and a half over two and a half in the later years which is a level we haven't really seen since 2000. So there's some question over whether that growth number is realistic, but also while yes there is fiscal tightening it is back loaded to these later years post the next election. So there's some questions to whether even this tightening will be delivered. So there are a couple of things to be to impact there, but ultimately yes we've got low arena this year. That's great news for markets, but at the same time we're going to have a significant amount bought by coming in later years. So the view is still very much bearish on guilt and I think ultimately the outlook for the UK is still relatively bleak and so we're still very much bearish on the pound here. OK bearish on the pound bearish from guilt. Perisha, sign but G 10 FX, scratches at BNP, parry by markets 360. Fantastic insights. Thank you for joining us this morning coming up ready for kick off. We are live. Yes from Qatar for a look ahead to increasingly controversial world cup. It begins this Sunday of course that is next this is bring.

17834," A digital first approach to the future work is where the industry and all companies will be heading. Click the future work not be at home or in the office but in the metaverse instead? There's that word, metaverse. Good, well, how are you doing? When I think about the metaverse, I think about immersive experiences that have a sense of actor presence. Wow, look at this. This is me. The metaverse is projected to become over a trillion dollar market by the end of this decade. And whether you know it or not, you'll probably be working there in the future. We're moving into a world where we're going to be interacting with computers with our bodies. This is definitely trippy. I think the adoption curve is going to be slow. It's weird, a real floaty thing right now. Oh, look at you. You have no legs. It's kind of a fun world and we're just at the very beginning of a very long journey. We're in the early stages of a sustainability revolution that has the magnitude of the industrial revolution coupled with the speed of the digital revolution. Nobody covers climate change like Bloomberg, your global business authority. Believe you me, this is the same before every World Cup. Go back to 1934, if you want. And the World Cup was in Italy and it was used as a vehicle to promote fascism for Mussolini. Though it writes on the streets by people in Brazil saying they shouldn't spend all this money on the stadiums, they should spend it on social care. We had Russia who invaded Crimea just a few years before. The former Englishman, Gary Linneke, comparing some of Qatar's controversies to previous World Cup. You can watch the full interview he gave on Emma Barnett meets on Bloomberg. Now, 12 years after being awarded the tournament, Qatar's World Cup is nearly upon us. The opening ceremony and first match happened on Sunday. The world, of course, will be watching not just for the action on the field, but for potential unrest around human rights issues. Let's bring in Bloomberg's Samoan Foxman, who's outside albites stadium in Qatar, where the opening match of the World Cup will be played Simone. What makes this World Cup unique? What is the atmosphere on the ground? Well, it's certainly probably one of the most controversial World Cup ever. But the first major sporting event in the Middle East, the first major sporting event since the end of the pandemic, the first time we're seeing a World Cup November December. That was controversial as well. The first time we're seeing a World Cup held in a single city. That is important as well, because there are some 1.2 million people expected to descend on this country over the course of the next month. But mind you, there are only 3 million people who live here. That's going to put a lot of stress on the infrastructure that Qatar has built to kind of maintain and have people enjoy this event. Bloomberg's Samoan Foxman on the ground for us ahead of the World Cup. Thank you very much indeed. Coming up more from the UK, I'm packing the impacts of that autumn statement and budget. Stay with us, this is Bloomberg. There is an epic saying in Italy. When it comes to family generations, the first generation creates the second generation expands and the third generation destroys. And that's almost what happened.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,448,2022-11-18 06:30:30
17835," and the third generation destroys. And that's almost what happened in the Gucci story. So, Hating and Love together. Now I would have had much more experience about those who say that love you and then they'll trade you. The Gucci family was the strength, but also the weakness of the label. The situation became dire with Gucci's finances. They were not able to pay salaries. They were not able to pay suppliers. Gucci's really teetering on the brink of the stage. Happy Friday. This is Blueberg Daybreak. These are the stories that set your agenda. Raising the stakes, Wall Street closes in the red as James Bullard apps the ante on his view of Fedhikes. But Asia stocks push higher, led again by technology. Plus, unprecedented chaos. The man overseeing the ruins of FTX reveals a quote, complete failure of corporate controls at the fallen digital empire. This as Twitter faces an exodus of remaining employees under Elon Musk. Bleak reality. UK Chancellor Jeremy Hunt lays out a harsh economic future of weak growth and rising taxes as Britain's face a record drop in living standards. Let's check in on the markets and the futures in the US-20 lower by about a tenth of a percent. Again, the chorus of Fed officials pushing back around any views that there's going to be a pause or a pivot when it comes to the rate-high cycle. James Bullard suggesting that 5 to 5 and a quarter percent is the minimum in terms of the terminal rate. Join as well by Neil Cushkari, followed by Mary Daley from San Francisco earlier this week suggesting that a pivot is not even in the cards. The MSCI Asia Pacific up a tenth of a percent. Alibaba coming in with some results that beat the estimates and added to some optimism within the technology sector in Asia. The future stateside, as I mentioned, down by about a tenth of a percent. And as that futures off by just eight points down about a tenth of a percent as well. And here in Europe, futures pointing high by about 5 cents of a percent. Our own reporting at Bloomberg suggesting that officials at the ECB are looking to a rate-hike of 50 basis points from 75 basis points in December, continue to watch that story on concerns about the recessionary impact and possibly inflation easing at the edges, though more data needs to come through on that front. Let's get back to what's happening in the UK, Dave. By the way, we had some consumer confidence data that came in stronger for a second month. But how long will that really last? UK Chancellor Jeremy Hunt, Chancellor, of course, of the ex-JECA, has laid bare a bleak new reality for the UK economy. One played by weak growth and rising taxes for years to come. Here's what he had to say about that outlook. They also judge that the UK, like other countries, is now in recession. Overall this year, the economy is still forecast to grow by 4.2%. GDP then falls in 2023 by 1.4%. Joining us now is Alex Dawson, UK Country Director at Global Council and a former special adviser to Prime Minister David Cameron and Theresa May. Alex, thanks for joining us in the studio. One of the key aims, then, for the Chancellor yesterday in this autumn statement was to both reassure the markets around credibility, but also not to get to a point where the measures he was putting in in terms of cuts to public services was going to prove so damaging that it wrecks and cripples public services already under threat. Did he manage to achieve that balance? Well, on the market side, he's clearly delivered something that's been slightly better pitched than Liz Truss and Quasiquarteng's mini budget back in September. But I think it's a very good open question about public services. Now they're already under strain. He's kind of acknowledging that by having a 55-45 spending.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,449,2022-11-18 06:34:56

17837," Brexit wasn't mentioned by name. If you look at the Solvency 2 package, which, you know, the insurance industry here is pretty pleased about, and has the ability to unlock a load of private capital that we've been looking to do in the UK for a long time, that is a benefit of Brexit. OK, Alex, with your political hat on, and bring back your time as an advisor to David Cameron and Theresa May, what is your sense of the ability for this Conservative Party under Rissisunak to close that polling gap? Can they survive, can they get through to 2025, and then what are their prospects at the election? They can close the gap, but I think it's still going to be there. I don't think they're going to totally follow through and actually sort of turn it into a polling lead. However, campaigns are unusual. Campaigns are different. I worked on two campaigns where the polls at the beginning were very different to what the polls were at the end. And, you know, there is still fundamentally the political view. Something must turn up, and the best thing we can do is lay a platform to try and deliver. And that's arguably what they've done. They've got a two-billion pound wall chest, that's bringing a knife to a gunfight. But if growth goes better, interest rates go slightly lower, then maybe they've got a bit more to fight with. OK, Alex Dawson, thank you very much for your insights for coming into the studio. Alex Dawson, UK Country Director at Global Council, just checking on a line that's crossed the terminal that Hang Sun tech index currently, again, have just a tenth of a percent. So, erasing the earlier gains of as much as 4.4% in the session, it had been bolstered by better than expected earnings out of Ali Barber. So, essentially, erased all of those gains, regulatory fears, maybe back in focus for investors. But those gains that we saw early in the session, essentially all but wiped out when it comes to technology shares and the big names listed in Hong Kong. Now, it is the final day of COP27. Nations are still no closer to reaching a deal. Let's get out to Bloomberg's Jennifer Tabasajah, who is at the summit in Sham Elshake. Jen, where do negotiations stand at this point? Yeah, Tom, I mean, that is the big question here. Right now, it's not looking like this COP is going to end as promising as it started. And it's really unclear whether we're actually going to see any sort of meaningful climate action. And the reason for this is because there's still a lot of outstanding issues that have not been addressed, notably mitigation, adaptation, climate finance, and also loss and damage. This key issue that we've been hearing about for the past two weeks, there's still diverging views on what exactly to do about loss and damage for developing countries. What we did see last night, Thursday night, from the EU, though, was a proposal to potentially step in and break the deadlock over loss and damage. And France Timmerman's detailed a proposal that would in exchange for some financial compensation for developing countries, developing countries would then be encouraged to phase down coal and phase down other fossil fuels. But it's unclear whether that is going to do enough to move these talks forward. And really, there's only 24 hours officially left in talks. And so there's going to have to be some sort of progress in order for people to feel that this COP is really a COP about implementation, about making progress on the promises and the pledges that were made in Glasgow back at COP26, Tom. Yes, so the clock is ticking. What are the positive outcomes from COP at this point, if any, Jen? Yeah, I mean, we did see a lot of new climate tech solutions, a lot of innovative solutions. There's been hundreds of exhibitions here of countries that are displaying solutions that they're taking on themselves. We also think it's quite notable that we've seen more countries signing on to the global methane pledge, which is, of course, a pledge to reduce methane emissions. We saw 12 more countries join this pledge. China did not join, but they did on Thursday propose their own draft, made their own draft proposal to phase down methane emissions. So there is some positive there, but I think, Tom, again, the issues that these key issues, loss and damage, mitigation, adaptation, if these issues don't get addressed, all of these other promising points, promising solutions that we've seen people taking on and announcing here are going to be a little bit dismissed, because the key issue that that countries want to...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,451,2022-11-18 06:43:44
17838," and points promising solutions that we've seen people taking on and announcing here are going to be a little bit dismissed because the key issue that countries want to see is some sort of finance facility in support for a lot of the climate breakdowns that we've seen over the past few years. Right, we'll see if they can get it over the line. Jen, Subba Jaja in a Shamar shake, of course, at COP27. Thank you very much indeed for the update there. Let's get the first word news now. North Korea has far a suspected intercontinental ballistic missile. It's a day after warning the US over continued military drills with allies in the region. Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida says the missile probably landed inside the country's exclusive economic zone. The new CEO of FTX has laid out a list of allegations against the company's former leadership slamming them for non-existent oversight and misuse of client funds in a sworn declaration former Enron liquidator John J. Ray says he's never seen such a complete failure of corporate controls. He also says advisors have located only a fraction of the digital assets they hope to recover. Nancy Pelosi is stepping down as the Democrats leader in the US now serve representatives. The decision comes after Republicans secured a slim majority in the chamber in last week's midterm elections. 82-year-old Pelosi has led House Democrats for almost 20 years under four presidents and was the first woman to serve as Speaker. Those were your first word news headlines. Coming up, we speak to Google's global head of government affairs and public policy. Karen Batter joins us from the APEC meeting. That is in Bangkok. That is next. This is Boombo. There's more activity in the fusion world than ever. And not just in government research labs. There's also an emerging private fusion industry that attracted billions of dollars in capital in recent years. Governments and private investors alike realize that we've got to find a solution that's going to allow us to get to next zero targets. This is one of the hardest but most rewarding problems that humanity could work on. Ultimately we all want the same thing. We want someone to put electricity on their grid from a fusion power station as quickly as possible. Frankly, the scale of the challenge, 3000 gigawatts of fossil fuel to replace. There's not many things that can do that. In fact, there may only be fusion that can really do that. And while many in the scientific community predict fusion power will take decades, some in the private fusion space, believe we'll get there in just a few years as soon as the 2030s. A multi-trillion dollar industry. There's a lot of ground to cover. Come on, these got absolutely crushed. We'll show you what's happening in ETFs like no one else.

17839," on the first day, actually, of the Global Leaders Summit after the APEC CEO summit, we have all the APEC Nation leaders, at least 14 of them, and also six of their representatives here. They're gathering for bilaterals, and of course, the big news has always been about Xi Jinping versus Kamala Harris, the two are trying to pitch their various pitches to the Southeast Asian and Asian leaders about their visions for engagement with Asia. And for more on that, I'd love to bring in our guest is Karambatya. You are the vice president of Google in charge of global government affairs. You're also the former deputy U.S. trade representative. You and I met back in 2005 in Hong Kong when the WTO talks were going on, failed talks, the Doha round. I wanted to ask you about how trade talks you see going now. Essentially, there are competing regional trade deals, whether it's TPP or, of course, RCEP, and then there's the new one, Indo-Pacific Economic Framework. Are these going to be all for not if the real discussion is simply going to be between the United States and China's supremacy in this part of the world? No, I don't think so, Stephen. I think these are important talks. These are real talks that are going on with IPEF. We see in the digital space, digital economic partnership agreement talks. These are remaining full. These will have to see what comes out of them. But the issues that you're looking to address are really 21st century economic issues. They're having to do with things like technology and barriers to trade that are new and different from the ones that existed before. So we're following it closely. We're optimistic that some of these things are going to come to fruition. How encouraged are you by the tone, at least, that was set between Joe Biden and Xi Jinping on Monday? Well, look, from everything that we read, there was constructive discussions that happened and that's good. There are significant global issues that are going to require the United States and China to work together. Climate change, obviously, being one, important to us and to many other parts of the world and the business community. So encourage, hopeful that we'll see more areas of collaboration. What's dominating your time when you're out in this part of the world as far as government affairs for Google, we all know about the saga in China where most of your services are not available and have not been. And I understand more recently, you actually closed down Google Translate in China as one of the last messages there. Are you seeing a similar wave in other parts of Asia that we've saw in China, maybe not so draconian, but Hong Kong is talking about a fake news law. There's some rumblings on the regulatory front in other parts of the world. It's interesting, we're really seeing two things. On the one hand, there's incredible appetite for technology and an interest in being at that sort of cutting edge of innovation throughout the region. And we're seeing that, I'm hearing that from the leaders that I'm engaging with here. So that's a really positive development. And Google continues to invest in solutions, technology solutions for the region. On the other hand, we are seeing a growth of, I guess what I would call fragmentation in the regulatory environment. So we are seeing different rules of the road being applied in the technology space. So the last three years alone, 1300 different rules adopted in the APEC region, governing how the internet operates how e-commerce works and so forth. So there are challenges in terms of creating harmonized systems. And from the private sector perspective, that is tough. So we're going to have to reinvent your products for each one. If it's getting fragmented, I imagine India's a big headache for you. I know a number of different public affairs heads of different tech platforms have left within the last year, whether it is you, Google, Meta, Twitter. What is the biggest challenge? What's going on in India? Well, look, I think India's an example of one of the markets that's really wrestling with how to regulate technology. And we've had and continued to have good conversations with the government there as we have with many of the other governments in the region that are thinking about this set of issues. From our vantage point, regulation is, of this space, is fine. It's to be expected. Right. Do you want to make sure that you're ready to go?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,453,2022-11-18 06:52:23
17840," about this set of issues. From our vantage point, regulation is, this space is fine, it's to be expected. We do want to make sure that it's regulation that's well informed by an understanding of what the consequences of regulation may be. There's sometimes a lot of eagerness, but it needs to be informed by real understanding of how these products are being constructed and what the impact of any particular regulation. The midterm elections in the United States change anything. Ted Cruz has talked about 2023 is going to be the year of tech company oversight. What's Google doing to prepare for maybe an onslaught? Well, look, we've been actively engaged with Congress for years testifying. We know we will continue to engage with them going forward. There are some big issues in the technology space that we want to see the US government address, US Congress address. Data privacy is a good example. This is a space that the US has lacked a comprehensive privacy law now for years. We need to have a single unified law, one that is going to allow certainty, people to understand what their roles and responsibilities are. Privacy is a hugely important issue for us. It would be great if there was a comprehensive law adopted. Misinformation, too, is another big one. Misinformation is another topic that gets a lot of attention. All right, Karan Batia, thanks so much for your time on Bloomberg Television. That's it for now from the APEC Leaders Summit here in Bangkok. Back to you, Tom. Steve Langel on the ground at APEC for us. Fantastic. Thank you very much indeed. Now, coming up ECB policymakers are said to be considering a slowdown of interest rate heights. Will he go live to Frankfurt next? This is Bloomberg. theoretical What do you think of when you think of a battery? For most it's what we use to power devices for both work and play and maybe even your car. Over the past few decades they've gotten way more powerful, long lasting and affordable. But all of this is just a prologue to what the next batteries are going to do. As we drive to an increasingly renewable power driven grid, we also need to be able to store energy and release it later to cover those periods of weather intermittencies that are driving this new grid that we're in. It's a multi trillion dollar opportunity and it's imperative that we figure out the solution here. How we store energy on a massive scale is in many ways the central challenge of the fight to stop climate change.

The ECB President Christine Lagarde is set to give the keynote speech later this morning. Let's go to Bloomberg's Maria today.

17841," December is around the corner. That means two things. Obviously it's Christmas, but also perhaps for some equally important is the last monetary policy decision of the year for the European Central Bank. And as you say, I mean, there's no question in terms of the fact that the European Central Bank will hike in December. That's pretty well calibrated. But there is a real debate going into this meeting around the magnitude of it. Will it be 50 basis points or 75 basis points? And as we reported this week on Bloomberg, there is growing momentum behind the 50 basis points for a number of reasons, Tom. We know that, of course, there is a deterioration on the macro picture for the European economy. Do you really need to hike aggressively, go in potentially into your recession? You have the fact that the European Central Bank already has, by the way, increased rates by 200 basis points. There's always lag between the policy and the implications that it has on the real economy. Perhaps cooling down inflation. And then, of course, Tom is the politics of the governing council. And this is where it gets interesting. If you're a hawkish, a member of the European Central Bank, and you want to get serious about QT, then maybe you have to hand in something. And that is, of course, a smaller hike. There's a lot of questions here, but luckily we'll hear from Christine Lagarde today at 930, Frank Friitt, and of course, we'll bring you that press conference and that keynote at Life on Bloomberg TV. Yeah, this is an important event. Great to have you on the ground, Maria. Thank you, as ever, Maria, today ahead of that speech from Madame Lagarde at a point where the euro dollar is currently trading at 1.03 expectations of maybe 50 basis points in December. Up next, Brumbo Market, Europe, stay with us. This is Brumbo. How much of that is true? How confident did you actually over achieve? Did you, you know, back then realize that we would be using AI in many different jobs? Is it slower or faster than you thought at the time? I think if I had a 35 or 40-year prediction task, I would have been more or less on track as to where we are today, but I would have predicted steady linear increase over time. But instead, the field had very minimal improvements until the last five or ten years. Then it really took off. I think we ended up in the right place, but I was very wrong about the trajectory. To this state, we still know very little about how the brain works, but these machines are getting ever more powerful. And I feel in some sense, we did end up learning how what human intelligence is by learning what it is not. If we exclude all the things machines can do better than us as what makes us unique in our human intelligence, then now we can rule out many, many things because AI or machine learning has become so good at so many things that what's left must be the key aspects of human intelligence.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,455,2022-11-18 07:01:06
17842," You will shed light on dark matter. You will make aging optional. Because when you subscribe to Bloomberg, you won't just get news. You will get insight into limitless possibilities. Before you change the world, Bloomberg. Good morning. Welcome to Bluebeck Market, Europe. I'm Anna Edwards, live in London. The cash trade is just less than an hour away here, or your top headlines. Raising the stakes, Walter E. Closes in the red, as James Bullard, ups the ante on his view of Fed hikes, but Asia's dogs and European futures push higher. Bleak reality. UK Chancellor Jeremy Hunt lays out a harsh economic future of weak growth and rising taxes as Britain's face a record drop in living standards. Plus, unprecedented chaos. The man overseeing the ruins of FTX reveals a quote, complete failure of corporate controls at the Fallen Digital Empire. Welcome to the program, everybody. It is Friday, just on 7 o'clock here in London, which means we've got some breaking news coming through in London. Let's get to you a little bit of economic news out of the UK today. Retail sales in focus. So if we include fuel, including auto fuel, month on month, the number has risen by 0.6% on retail sales. That is just a touch ahead of where the estimate had it have 0.5% looking at the year-on-year figure. That is a drop of 6.1%. But the survey was for a drop of 6.5%. So perhaps you can say at the margin that these numbers are a little better than had been anticipated. The pound showed a little bit of life as we saw those numbers hitting the Bloomberg terminal. But not a great deal. Of course, we all know the bigger picture in recession, even the government says, in the UK now. And a lot of focus on just how cold it gets over the winter. Therefore, how much money everybody has to spend on heating? And that will have an impact on the rest of the economy, of course. So that's the UK story right now. We'll return to that in just a moment. Let's have a look at where we are on the broader picture. This is what the future's picture looks like. An hour away from the start of cash equity trading here in Europe. And I just say in the headlines that futures looks a little more buoyant in Europe. And that is the case. We're up by 6% of 1% on Euro stocks 50 futures. But see futures a little more lagging behind as they have done in recent or at least going their own way as they have done in recent sessions. And the DAX futures also looking a little stronger. Yesterday we saw a pullback in Europe and in the US. But it was pretty modest. US futures though do look as if they want to focus on the downsides. But they are flat to negative. So not really negative by much. And in fact, not as negative as they were just half an hour ago also. So certainly things fairly flat across the future's picture for Europe and into the US session. Let's have a look at the GMM, see what's moving there. And what isn't in fact? In terms of the Asia session, we're up by a quarter of 1%. So a little bit more strength than just half an hour ago, but not much. It's certainly strength in the Chinese currency comes through in the GMM. You can see the Chinese where Mimbi is stronger. You can see the pound actually a little bit stronger. 119 the handle now. Yesterday, of course, we saw the autumn statement a budget by any other name coming through from the UK government. And generally stability in these markets. But there's still something to talk about there. US yields in focus, of course. US yields actually dropping this morning after rising yesterday on those comments from James Bullard. We talked about in their headlines, talking about 5 to 5 and a quarter percent now, his terminal rate. That's up around half a percent from where he saw it previously. So that's the hawkish language. Also in the shadows talk of a seven handle. But it will come to that later. But certainly that is the hawkish language that the market has focused on and has resulted in a little bit of nervousness for features. Let's stay with that UK story, though. We just broke the retail sales numbers. Let's get to the bigger picture. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has laid a bare, oblique new reality for the country's economy with his fiscal statement, one plagued by weak growth and rising taxes for years to come. Joining us now, Jordan Rochester, Namiura's G10 FX strategies. Jordan, if the aim of this was to do things in a way that would not spook the market, would do what the market requires, maybe go no further. But certainly to not spook the market, was it job done? It was job done. It was. In terms of leak everything to the press in advance as much as you can, check. In terms of involve the OBR forecast and not dismiss the experts, check.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,456,2022-11-18 07:05:25
17843," It was, in terms of leak everything to the press in advance as much as you can, check. In terms of involve the OBR forecast and not dismiss the experts, check. And in terms of austerity and not leading to unhinged guilt's issuance check and to actually rein in that issuance. So I think we've had a lot out of what the market would have wanted on the mini budget day. I think if Liz Truss has actually gone ahead with her budget but involved the OBR and had some sense of a fiscal rule, we wouldn't have been in the same situation. So that was the first budget I'd ever seen move sterling like that and I hope it's the last. And yesterday's was more like normal. Right. And were you surprised that, well, maybe you're not surprised to talk. Tell me what you think about the profiling, the back loading of some of the pain. Does it make the bank of England's job a little bit harder in the short term that some of the generosity comes in the short term and we know the reasons for that, the pain on the UK economy that we're either in or expecting. But then some of the painfuls later on, that profiling, how did that strike you? I think it's a fantastic profile if you're trying to avoid recession or if you're trying to minimise the hit of the recession that we pretty much are already in. So I do think it was quite smart in that respect. I think it was smart politically as well, putting all the hard decisions until after the next election means probably this chancellor won't be making that decision based on current polling and therefore be lit up to the Labour Party if polling stays the same of course. But the other thing is a lot of people don't realise that politicians have been pushing back on monetary policy makers saying, look at your fault, we've got all this inflation. You haven't raised rates enough but that's not particularly 100% true. The other option is to raise taxes and to not do as much fiscal stimulus as previously thought. So this budget is kind of a mixture of the two where they're doing a bit more austerity than before so that should hopefully get inflation down but you're right. In the very short term, it won't get inflation down to 2% quickly next year. That's just basically a bit of a good luck in energy markets and what the bank of England has already done. Does that mean the bank of England does what everybody thought it was going to do before rather than bring higher people's expectations of what the BOE has to do or does it? Yeah, I don't think the budget yesterday will raise people's expectations too much on the bank of England but the actual inflation data we had this past week was pretty awful that came in above expectations once again. You've got all these leading indicators that we used high frequency data forward looking sort of signals that point to peak inflation in the UK whether that's CBI selling prices, the PMIs where we look at PPI, the factory prices that come out of the manufacturing gates. They all suggest we should have peak inflation in the UK yet it keeps rising in the official data so that's a big concern for the market. It's a big concern for the bank of England. I think that essentially is going to peak soon hopefully by Christmas and then we can be on a similar story to what we're seeing in the US but in Europe and the UK we're still got hot inflation so their central banks will be in a pretty tricky spot but I do actually like what the bank is doing is they're being very clear we think it's going to be recession we think this is all very short term there's nothing we can do and they think inflation will be below their target in two years. Right and if you think that none of this is going to support the pound too much Jordan or at least if you think there are opportunities to short the pound against what? So the main way to think of foreign exchange markets is you got to understand the correlations to the underlying asset classes. When equities go up and down when fixed income goes up and down commodities that drives trade flows that drives financial flows that's what drives foreign exchange and correlations can be fickle. They're sometimes just really difficult to pin down. It used to be all about interest rates if the bank of England raised interest rates the pound used to go up. That really isn't the case right now because we're in a 1970 style stack flation market. The most important factor is growth and yesterday we had austerity the UK is already heading towards recession so I think it's going to underperform peers because a lot of other European countries have done the opposite Germany's done a big spending package. The UK is now tightening its fiscal belt so I think the likes of sterling Swiss shorts are nice risk off hedge and also an underperformance in Europe story works against the sort of long euro dollar position we have. OK, we'll get to your other call shortly. Thanks very much Jordan. Jordan Rochester and Emura G10 FX strategies stays with us a little bit longer on the programme.

Morning Anna, North Korea has fired a suspected intercontinental ballistic missile a day after warning the US over continued military drills with allies in the region. Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida says the missile landed inside the country's exclusive economic zone. In an effort to break deadlocked climate talks in Egypt, the European Union has proposed a loss and damaged finance facility for the most vulnerable countries. EU climate chief Franz Timmermans put forward the offer in exchange for a pledge to reduce the use of oil, gas and coal. It comes after days of little progress at COP27 talks in Sharmael Shake. Nancy Pelosi is stepping down as the Democrats leader in the US House of Representatives. The decision comes after a public conscured a slim majority in the chamber in last week's midterm elections. 82-year-old Pelosi has led House Democrats for almost 20 years under four presidents and was the first woman to serve as Speaker. Twitter has closed its offices until Monday after Elon Musk gave staff an ultimatum to either commit to working long hours at high intensity or to leave. Sources have been in the office for many more workers to sign Musk's pledge than he expected, potentially putting Twitter's operations at risk. A memo seen by Bloomberg also urged staff to refrain from discussing confidential information on social media or in the press.

The government covers the Fed like Bloomberg. Welcome back to Bloomberg Market's Europe. Let's get to an update on the chaos surrounding FTX, of course. Advisors overseeing the ruins of San Bankman-Freeze Crypto Empire have laid bets on English der allegations against the company's former leadership. They've slammed non-existent oversize and the misuse of client funds as they struggled to locate billions of dollars in missing assets. Let's get to our crypto reporter in Singapore, Sir Vashri Gosh. Sir Vashri, an incredible list of criticisms of the old management of FTX by the guy who's been brought in to clear this up. This is somebody who's seen Enron, so he knows something about clearing up a mess. Even he is surprised by what he's finding. Exactly. It is. The FTX, the way that it is unraveling, is really surprising to many of us. As you said, the guy who was in charge of the Enron mess as well as saw this happening and is surprised. We are trying to find out more details as we speak about the unraveling the contagion. Surprisingly, the markets are holding off pretty well from despite this contagion, we can see that Bitcoin has been up 3% so far this week, which is respite for many of the investors. Our part of this reason could be also because the contagion is limited so far as of now in the crypto world. So not really. I cannot spill over to the broader, bigger financial world. That's why it is holding off so far. But we are looking at the very closely in the contagion risks from here onwards. Okay, so that's the market impacts of Asri. Back to the story around FTX specifically. What struck you as most interesting when it comes to some of the colour around this and some of the detail? Now it's amazing to see they're talking about almost a complete lack of dependable records. One of the nice pieces of reporting within our story says that if you wanted to get an expense claim approved, you basically just, you used messaging systems that frequently disappeared and you just got an emoji in response as to whether you could claim it or not. I mean, some quite incredible operating procedures, I suppose you could say. Yeah, exactly. The issue with this kind of the way this story is unraveling is we are seeing new facts about what exactly was going on going in the company and nobody had an inkling what was happening. For example, as you mentioned, customers, funds and employees, funds where they were deployed between Alameda and FTX Alameda's, FTX's trading form, we had no idea before. Now it is all coming out in the truth that they were tremendous combingling of those funds. They were lent outside the system. There was too much of leverage and all of it is coming out in terms of how the entities are. There are more than 130 entities in FTX and all of them are all together in this. So it's a very difficult process of completely coming out with the entire truth. We have also seen surprisingly few of notice that the Bahamian liquidators are also kind of a little bit surprised and concerned about FTX filing FTX filing their bankruptcy in the US. Again, that is another new development where the Bahamian authorities are in consultation with the US authorities on this. Okay. So some sort of disruption there. Sebastian, thank you very much. Sebastian Hosh. Our crypto reporter in Singapore. Now, higher interest rates have been playing. Haguev Havoc, of course, with the crypto space. Let's get back to that higher interest rate story. And central banks as the Fed's Jim Bullard push back against market hopes of a pivot. Even under these generous assumptions, the policy rate still isn't at a zone that might be considered sufficiently restricted. To get to this sufficiently restrictive level.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,459,2022-11-18 07:18:24
17846," might be considered sufficiently restricted. To get to this sufficiently restrictive level of policy will need to increase the policy rate further. Let's stay on this story. Bring back Jordan Rochester, Numerity, and FX strategist. Your thoughts on the Fed, then, Jordan? After we heard from Bullard, I mean, he was talking about going from the high falls to the low fives in terms of his terminal raise. But there was a slight shadow of something higher in his presentation, wasn't there? A lot of people making a fuss about whether he, you know, why is he putting seven on the table as even a discussion point? What did you make of the hawkishness that we saw there? Indeed, he said five to five, 25, is kind of where a minimum he wants to get to. And then he threw out the tailor or sort of approach saying anywhere between five and seven percent would be more appropriate. And seven percent is absolutely nowhere near what the market's pricing. We've got a peak Fed terminal rate pricing around 4.90, 4.86, something like that. So you're adding on at least 2% to that range. Now Bullard's always been one of the more activists on the FWC. He's also prone to changing his views. So as the data changes, he might change that tone of voice. And I think what the markets focused on is all the leading indicators for inflation in the US, they're collapsing, whether it's used car prices, whether it's the high frequency rent data, and whether you just simply look at PPI, which is very much affected by energy, that leads CPI quite significantly. So the sort of leading indicators from that suggest that we should cool down to 6 to 6.5% in US inflation over the next three months, pretty quickly. Now that's still 6 to 6.5%. The Fed won't be happy with that. But as long as all the leading indicators continue to suggest a slow down, the markets will probably will. But if Fed officials want to lean hawkish still, they might clutch at retail sales data and say, well, look, that's not really falling off a clear sign that there's still a lot of money in the system, a lot of strength in balance sheets. Is that something that might justify the hawkishness from the Fed Jordan? I think the ex-house savings we've had since COVID helped justify it. I think the high level of job openings, they've fallen slightly, but they're still historically very high. That justifies being hawkish. So, Numeras got one of the highest tolerate forecasts on the street. We're looking for five and a half percent to five 75 next year. The market's not pricing that 490ish, as I said. And we're going to probably see a slow down at the December meeting. So we'll probably get that 50 basis points, but we'll have more hikes in the market, thanks. But I do think if the Fed wanted to really have taken control of the narrative better, after the inflation data last week, they shouldn't have let the doves end the week with the conversation. We should have had blood coming out much faster. So it tells me that the Fed was a bit uncertain how to react to the CPI. We had wallow over the weekend and we got more hawk coming out next week as well. But I do think the markets had enough of listening to the hawks because all of the leading indicators that help the markets make decisions are pointing towards low inflation. I thought they were all hawks now, Jordan, but it seems no. Between the hawk, you know, there are a good levels of hawkishness and we're managing to discern between them. Let me ask you about the way to play this, then. I see the Chinese yuan is on the front for this morning. And I know that you have thoughts around dollar yuan and wear that heads with the story around inflation in the US, but also the reopening story in China. Yeah, I think what's happening in the markets we've been long the dollar for most this year and it was a bit of a shock to clients when we went short the dollar this week. And one of the main reasons that we were long the dollar for most of this year was global growth is slowing down. That dominates everything. I think what's happening now is yes, we've got China COVID cases making record highs. We've got lockdown slowly rising, but we've seen tweaks to the Chinese COVID-19 policy, which suggests that maybe in the spring next year they really do accelerate their reopening plans. It feels all very end of 2020. You might remember the UK went into lockdown, but how unrallyed and euro rallied. And the reason for that was the market was pulling forward next year's reopening trade to today. And I think that's what's happening in China. Combine that with the inflation story of the US. You have CPI in the US. You've got China pivoting, perhaps on COVID-19, slowly learning to live with it. It's still going to be lockdowns probably. We've all rising cases we're seeing. We're not out the end of the tunnel just yet. OK, OK, and Jordan, with no link whatsoever, I'm going to go out and a limb and say that you'll probably be going to be rooting for the England team during the World Cup.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,460,2022-11-18 07:22:53
17847," the tunnel just yet. Okay, and Jordan, with no link whatsoever, I'm going to go out and a limb and say that you'll probably be going to be rooting for the England team during the World Cup. But correct me if I'm wrong about that. You are an analytical person, somebody who likes statistics, how do you rate their chances? Well, we've gone at the FIFA rankings, but England's actually had a pretty awful summer. The last win was back in March. We lost four years against Hungary. We tumbled out of the Nations League. So it's been a really soft start. I don't know about you, Anna. Has anyone sung free lines on the shirt? Football's coming home to you recently. It's not like the Euro's last summer. Not this summer, the morning. Yeah, exactly. So I think that we'll have a tough game with Iran, actually. Iran's probably going to do better than what people think in this group stage. In the world, we get to quarters, something like that. Jordan, thank you very much. Thanks for joining us. Have a good week in when we get there. Jordan Rochester and Amira's G10 FX strategies coming up. We will be talking about Katar and the work up there. We'll also get to COP27 is coming to an end, but with the climate talks dead logs, will this year's summit end as a cop out? We are back in Egypt. Live shots coming to us from Sharmael's shake in Egypt. Where all that action has been happening over recent weeks, this is playback. There is an epic saying in Italy when it comes to family generations that the first generation creates. The second generation expands and the third generation destroys. And that's almost what happened in the Gucci story. So, Hating a Love. Now I do the heavy much more experience about those who say that love you and then they trade you. The Gucci family was the strength, but also the weakness of the label. The situation became dire with Gucci's finances. They were not able to pay salaries. They were not able to pay suppliers. Gucci is really teetering on the brink at this stage. Welcome back to Boombag Market, Europe. 35 or so minutes to go until the start of cash equity training. We are going to have a look at the US. It is the final day of the year. It is a final day of the year. It is a deal. Let's get to our colleague, Jen, who joins us now over from Sharmael's shake. Good to see you. Where do negotiations stand? Anna, you said it right there at the top. It is unlikely or not as great as people would have hoped on this last day of the COP27 summit. It is unclear whether we are actually going to see any meaningful climate action coming out of this event. Truthfully, waking up this morning, it didn't seem very good. On Thursday, we were hearing from people like the UN Secretary General and also from the COP president saying there is still a widespread lack of progress on a number of key issues.

I'm talking about things like adaptation, climate finance, and notably loss and damage. Anna, this is the big issue that has run through this whole entire conference. And there's still an issue over funding. Now, the one maybe positive sign that we did get on Thursday was from the European Union and from friends Timmerman, who is the climate chief, of course. And he offered a proposal for loss and damage for developing nations. And it's a little bit detailed, but it gets into some of the issues that developing nations have wanted to see specifically funding and transition. They would have to phase down fossil fuels. So there's still a lot left to be seen, Anna, but of course, only a few hours until we can get a deal. Okay. Jen, thank you very much. So the conference started talking about loss and damage. Good to have your update, though, on the program. Jen Sabazanga joining us there from COP27 in Sharmleshake. Coming up on the program, ECB policy makers are set to be considering a slowdown of interest rate heights. We will be live in Frankfurt. Maria today, her join us from the European banking congress. So we'll be hearing from Christian like I'd later. And this is Blèmewig. Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey. My grandfather got into the mutual fund business because the average investor could not get a diversified stock portfolio and it was too dangerous to put your entire savings in it just a couple of companies. So, the mutual fund was created to give a diversified expert management at a reasonable price. Today, we have a phenomenon where companies are waiting much longer to go public. And so, in 2000, the average company went public after three years. Now, companies are waiting nine to ten years because there's so much money available in the private markets. As a matter of fact, there are half the number of public companies that there were in 2000 and there's five times the number of private equity back companies. So, just from an investable universe, you look at the private markets and it's significantly bigger. So, the question is, that return that used to be captured in the public markets is now captured in the private markets. But the problem is, you know, is you're really tied up for a long time when you invest in a private equity fund. And so, trying to figure out a way to solve the same problem my grandfather was trying to solve, which is, how do you bring those returns responsibly, the democratization of the private markets to the retail investors? And I describe it as a bit of like running the scissors. This is a great tool if you use it appropriately. And so, we're focused on trying to figure out responsibly bringing it into the average investor. In a multi-trillion dollar industry, there's a lot of ground to cover. Come on, and he's got absolutely crushed. We'll show you what's happening in ETFs like no one else. Bloomberg ETF IQ. Monday on Bloomberg. This is Bloomberg Daybreak, but let's go.

17849," Welcome back to Blue Bed Market's Europe half an hour until the start of cash equity trading for another day for another Friday. In fact, here are your top stories. Raising the stakes, Wall Street closes in the red as James Bullard ups the ante on his view of Fed Hikes, but Asia stocks and European futures push a little higher. Fleet Reality UK Chancellor Jeremy Hunt lays out a harsh economic future of weak growth and rising taxes as Britain's face a record drop in living standards. Plus, on precedented chaos, the man overseeing the ruins of FTX revealed a quote, complete failure of corporate controls at the Fallen digital empire. Welcome back to the programme then, yes half an hour until the start of European trading this Friday morning and the future's picture looks a little brighter here in Europe than it does over in the United States. Yesterday was a down day for European and US stocks, but the future's picture here in Europe suggests a little bit of life, maybe not so much stateside, e-minis are flat with a little downward bias and as that futures up just a tenth of a percent. So, let us leave the equity markets there. Let's focus in on what's going on in some other asset classes and Valerie Tytel joins us to tell us what is caught her eye this morning. Valerie, I know that what is caught your eye is the subject of oil, which has sort of stealthily been moving its way down with Brent now below $90. Yeah, exactly Anna and the one thing I want to show you is this fantastic chart here which shows the prompt spread, which has shown that we have gone from absolute tight, tight supply during the Russia sanctions on oil to now almost slipping in contango, which is hinting at over supply. Just what an epic squeeze we've seen. The levels re-reached in February were the highest backwardation since the Gulf War and now we're about to flip. It's mind blowing almost. Now, this is coming just ahead of the EU sanctions on Russia's seaborne oil, which go into effect early December. Now, that was a key catalyst that many thought was going to tighten supply further into the end of the year. But we've had things like China COVID cases rise higher than expected, leading many to think that the reopening story isn't going to happen anytime soon, meaning oil demand is lower. And we know that these rate hikes that we've seen this year are now feeding into global demand and dinting demand for oil on the back of that. But look, Anna, you know, these EU sanctions that are rolling out in mid-December, they also come at a time where we have an OPEC meeting on December 5th. So there may be some key catalysts that we could see oil spike higher from here, but the market is clearly hinting we're having an oversupply at the moment. Okay, yeah, an oil price is moving, have been moving lower as a result, haven't they been moving lower? Yeah, I know some of our colleagues in China pointing to the low levels, the light traffic levels that we're seeing on Chinese streets and just underlining your points about how getting to a recovery in China might take a little bit longer. Thanks very much, Bloomberg's Valerie Tysel with the latest on oil markets. Now, key figures from the world's of monetary policy and banking in Europe are gathering in Frankfurt for the European banking Congress. We'll be watching out for ECB President Christine Lagarde, who's going to be there and who's set to give a keynote speech in just a little while this morning for more. Let's go to Bloomberg's Maria today, who is in Frankfurt for us. Maria, good morning. There's growing debate in the market over the rate trajectory for the ECB going into December, you know, whether it'll come down to 50 from 75. What do we know? Yes, Adam, fundamentally that is a question. December is really around the corner and the debate out there is will it be 50 basis points or will it be 75 basis points? And as we reported this week on Bloomberg, there is some momentum behind the 50 basis points for a number of reasons. Anna, when you look at the European Central Bank, they've already increased rates by 200 basis points. Some actually say there is a lack between the policy and the real implications for the economy. Perhaps inflation could be cooling down. Then of course, you have the fact that there is a deterioration in the European economy. Do you really need to hike aggressively 75 basis points going potentially into a recession? And then of course, you have the politics always of the European governing council, the European Central Bank governing council. If you are serious about QT, you're on the hawkish side of the central bank. Perhaps the way to balance that out is with a smaller hike. So that takes you to 50 basis points. There's a lot of",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,463,2022-11-18 07:35:49
17850," about QT, you're on the hawkish side of the central bank. Perhaps the way to balance that out is with the smaller hike. So that takes you to 50 basis points. There's a lot of questions, a lot of debates, but of course, luckily we'll hear from Madame Lagarde in about an hour I believe from now and we'll bring you that keynote live here, of course, on Blumber TV. OK, yeah, we'll be listening out for that then, and then he clues about policy. Today the ECB is also announcing data on the repayments of its teletro loans, so those cheat loans to the banking sector, Maria. What do we expect to see there? Yes, and I remember those will fund in cheap funding from the European Central Bank. The terms were changed retroactively in the previous monetary policy decision meeting. Of course, the message from the bank was very clear. They want well, banks to stop the arbitration and use the early windows to make those early repayments. Now we'll find out amid a whether or not the banks responded to this call from the ECB and by how much it's also interesting, by the way, today Anna that we have will members of the ECB but also members of the banking industry in Europe will have the Deutsche Bank CEO present here. Remember, when this was announced, they said that they did not agree with the decision, the fact that the richer actively changed some of the terms was not good form from the ECB, so I guess it'll be interested to see one of the two collide and whether or not some of the tensions perhaps have cooled now. Yeah, well, listen to see if those tensions are out in the open then, Maria. Thanks very much. Brinkberg's Maria, today, oh, with a lovely backdrop there in Frankfurt. Now, the banking sector is in focus at the European banking congress then in Frankfurt and banks in Europe have been active in corporate debt markets this year, despite volatile capital markets that have kept other issuers on the sidelines. Essential banks, perhaps, step down their hiking, are there opportunities in corporate credit? Joining us now, Marco Baldini, the Barclays co-global head of investment grade syndicates to talk corporate debt, Marco, very nice to have you with us. Thank you very much for joining us. So it's been a pretty slow year in Europe for issuers and a lot of volatility in markets that maybe have kept some corporates on the sidelines. Now we've seen those inflation numbers in the US and maybe coming off the boil a little bit. Has that excited corporate sufficiently to get them coming back into the market and issuing? Good morning, Anna. Yeah, absolutely. We saw after those inflation figures last week in the US it really quite a buoyant resurgency in the European markets and we saw certain parts of the market re-open that had been closed for a few weeks or indeed months. To give you a couple of examples, some of the European banks like Deutsche Bank, BNP and Sokjen were able to issue 81 securities, which obviously are amongst the most risky and also we saw a sub-investment grade corporate hybrid issued by Telefonica, the Spanish telco. It felt actually like investors were really trying to get their hands on paper as much paper as they could buy after those inflation numbers, whether that was because they had already started to take a view that they could be a pivot or that the pause was good enough for them, but absolutely we saw investors chasing these new issues and really even new issue concessions to find significant. Is there any urgency from European corporates to raise money right now? What do those post-COVID war chests look like? How strong are the balance sheets still? I think the balance sheets are certainly an investment grade remain pretty robust. And look, if you look across balance sheets in the European banking sector, it has been relatively light and unencumbered this year. And I think this has given comfort to certainly many European investment grade companies that they don't necessarily have to issue in the markets. And it's allowed some of them to maybe avoid coming into the market for the most volatile times. I think this could change as we move into next year. I think with the start of potential recessionary backdrop, I think banks will be watching their balance sheets a lot more tightly. And I think this could lead to companies having to come to the bond market more than we've seen. OK, come to the recession theme in a moment. Just on the financial sector and the way that banks have been raising money, you cited a couple of examples of that post- the inflation prints in the United States. Do you expect because the financials have been raising money, have been active in bond markets in corporate debt, in a way that other corporates maybe weren't quite so much this year? Do you think that the banking sector continues to stand out? Is that a theme that continues? Yeah, I mean, absolutely. If you look at the sea as issuance compared to last year's issuance,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,464,2022-11-18 07:40:10
17851," is the most important thing to do with the financial companies. The banking sector continues to stand out. Is that a theme that continues? If you look at the seizure insurance compared to last year's issuance, it is the financial companies, the banks that have been issuing. The volumes are almost in line with where we were this point last year, which is quite surprising maybe given the volatility that we've had to endure this year. To your point, banks have been incredibly aggressively going towards the capital markets. They have been the standout issuers in the market. When it comes to how investors see it, for sure, because banks have been using the markets far more, the new issue concessions for banking issuers have been higher than we've seen in the corporate sector. In addition, something you referred to there with the changes in the TLTR rules could actually mean that the banks will continue to have to be heavy users of capital markets as we move into the market. Yes, we were just hearing from our colleague, Maria, about how they were paying back early in some cases. Now, looking ahead a little bit then, and you mentioned the recession word. Now, we have seen this rallying credit there, and we've seen spreads coming down. As recession fears build, what happens to those spreads, do you think? I think in investment grade, it will certainly, it's going to affect not only spreads, of course, it will affect rates, as we know, as we move into next year. I think it will be a case of investors being very, very disciplined and supporting those issuers that obviously are well positioned to deal with a potential recessionary environment. This is why we think investment grade, certainly in Europe, looks very good as we move into next year. It screens about 60 basis points cheap to US credit, because obviously our market has been more impacted by the Ukraine situation, and we're going to have a more energy crisis, so our spreads have been a little bit more beaten up here in Europe. But as we move into next year, I absolutely think that, as long as investors are, you know, picky, when they look at which credits they want to support, I don't think there's any reason why you can't continue to see some measure of spread tightening into next year, even with the potential backdrop of a recessionary environment. And thinking about how much tightening we get from central banks, we talked about the opportunities of the credit that perhaps this slightly off the boil inflation picture produced over in the United States. But now we hear the sort of hawkish drum being hit once again by the likes of James Bullard, talking about terminal rates getting to the low fives, and even this idea that, you know, well, maybe there's a reason to take them up as far as seven. How much would that sort of spook credit markets? I think it would, of course, continue to spook credit markets. And that's been the theme of this year. You know, if you look at some of the, again, sort of more, you know, back to usual business inflation prints that we've seen since the US CPI last week, and again, these hawkish comments from the Fed, you know, to a certain degree investors have shrugged it off. So I think investors will really be looking to see if this is further tough talk, or whether, you know, there is potentially the fact that we could still be behind the curve when it comes to fighting inflation, and that we continue to see more rate rises next year than those that are being forecast. I think for the market to be stable into next year, we want investors to feel that where it's towards the top of the hiking cycle across the global central banks. And it started to feel like that recently. So the jury will be out on whether that is still the backdrop as we head into 2023. Marco, thank you very much. Thanks for joining us. Very good to speak to you. Marco, Baldini, Barclay's co-global head of investment grade syndicate. Interesting to you, Fiti and a conversation as we head towards the end of the year on corporate credits. Now, coming up on the program, ready for kickoff.

17852," There's more activity in the fusion world than ever and not just in government research labs. There's also an emerging private fusion industry that attracted billions of dollars in capital in recent years. Governments and private investors alike realize that we've got to find a solution that's going to allow us to get to net zero targets. This is one of the hardest but most rewarding problems that humanity could work on. Ultimately we all want the same thing. We want someone to put electricity on their grid from a fusion power station as quickly as possible. Frankly the scale of the challenge, 3000 gigawatts of fossil fuel to replace. There's not many things that can do that. In fact there may only be fusion that can really do that. And while many in the scientific community predict fusion power will take decades, some in the private fusion space, believe we'll get there in just a few years as soon as the 2030s.

It was used as a vehicle to promote fascism for Mussolini. There were rights on the streets by people in Brazil saying they shouldn't spend all this money on the stadiums. They should spend it on social care. We had Russia who invaded Crimea just a few years before. Sports, sports, and former England footballer of course, Gary Linnaker comparing some of Qatar's controversies to previous World Cup. You can watch the full interview that he gave to Emma Barnett there on the programme Emma Barnett meets. That is available to you on Bloomberg Critic. 12 years after being awarded the tournament, Qatar's World Cup is nearly upon us. It's the most expensive World Cup ever and the world will be watching. Not just for the action on the field but for potential unrest among human around, of course, plenty of human rights issues. Let's get to Simone Fogsman for a brief. She joins us from outside one of the stadiums that have been built. And boy did they have to build a lot. Simone. Last time I was in Qatar was some 10 years ago. I mean, LaSale did not exist. The Pearl was only half built. It is a country completely transformed by this. Thinking about the financials here. Has this been a good investment for Qatar? Are they pleased with what they've managed to achieve? Absolutely. And really development was the key reason they wanted the World Cup in the first place. Because, you know, 12 years ago they were an over-large fishing village. They just recently started to see this influx of money from LNG. Now we're talking about a modern port, a brand new metro system. One of the best airports in the world, which just recently was expanded. All of this new stuff has been sped up for the World Cup. And that was really a key part of the reason the father Emir Shah-Hama, the former ruler, wanted to bring this World Cup here. But another reason as well, you know, you have to look at a tumultuous region, frankly. And Qatar has been at the center of that over the last five years. Because five years ago, the likes of Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain, Egypt, abruptly cut trade travel ties. Suddenly Qatar was out on its own. And so it wants people to know where Qatar is on the map, even though those folks have come back into the fold. And in fact, they're going to see some of the tourists that are coming here as well. You know, that memory is not lost. And now, of course, the event has been plagued by controversies. Gary Lenika was just saying there that this happens before many World Cups.

17853," memory is not lost. Now of course, the event has been plagued by controversies. Gary Linnika was just saying that this happens before many world cups, but the dust seems to have been a lot of intense criticism. Certainly on the human rights side of things, also social norms and rules. How has Qatar responded? Because they have taken action against... They have taken action, sorry, on some of the rights of migrant workers and they've actually been quite angered by some of the criticism which they have described as in their view kind of racist. So, where do you think Qatar has responded to this criticism? Yeah, absolutely. Sheikh Tameem, the current ruler, calling this an unprecedented campaign against the country. Migrant workers, they have made substantial reforms. They've instituted the first universal minimum wage in the Gulf region, meaning it doesn't matter what nationality you are, you get paid at least $274 a month. I know that doesn't sound like much, but that's something they've improved safety standards and the like. But the human rights criticism has turned... I mean, look, it's still there around the treatment of migrant workers. There are things activists want, but it's now moved to other social freedoms, the right to be out and LGBTQ, to free expression, to protest on the street, the rights of women. And we haven't seen as many reforms there, you know, some of the other controversies. This is not just it, you know, one thing was it said, the organizer said this was supposed to be a carbon neutral world cup. That really hasn't come to fruition. And what remains to be seen, and one of the key things we're going to be watching here, is how well the country can accommodate this massive influx, 1.2 million fans in a population of just 3 million. Lots of concern about whether the country would have enough accommodation. What the roads will be like if everyone can get to their stadiums in time to see these matches. And that we will see over the course of the next couple days. Yeah, I mean, not only if they built, you know, seven stadiums, eight stadiums, but they've also built an entire transport system. Didn't exist 10 years ago at all when I was there. I do remember it being a pretty conservative Muslim country. Is there much conversation about how this is going to be police, for example? How crowds, how potentially drunk crowds are going to be managed? Not something that I imagine authorities in Qatar are all used to dealing with the tool. No, yeah, I mean, it is possible to drink here. An alcohol has been one of those things people really want to know about. But, you know, what I've done for my reporting is learned that there is an internal presentation going around suggesting security forces aren't going to heavily police some social codes, including public drunkenness protests, which, you know, are not particularly legal here. They're not going to police that in the way that they normally would. In fact, they're not even going to approach, detain or prosecute any of that. But what we've heard from organizers is they still want folks to respect the social norms on the ground. Yes, they're going to be tolerant, but the message is not is that their laws still apply. So this is kind of one of these question marks because we haven't gotten a lot of clarity from the actual officials directly. But what we understand, not just from my reporting, but also from diplomats, is that some of those social wars likely to relax. People are going to be wearing tank tops shorts, and no one's going to really give them too much of a problem. Hmm. Okay, yeah, that certainly wasn't the case 10 years ago. So, Moe, thank you very much. Moe Bay, Simone Fulksman joining us there in Qatar with all the latest on the preparations, the financials, and some of the controversies that have, of course, surrounded this world cup. Let's get a Bloomberg business match. Top corporate stories we're tracking this morning, including the latest on crypto, is Alice. Hi, Anna. The new CEO of FDX has laid out a list of allegations against the company's former leadership, slamming them for non-existent oversight and misuse of client funds. In his sworn declaration submitted to Bankruptcy Court, former N. Ron liquidator, John J. Ray, says he's never seen such a complete failure of corporate controls. He also says advisors have located only a fraction of the digital assets they hope to recover. Twitter has closed its offices until Monday, after Elon Musk gave staff an ultimatum to either commit to working long hours at high intensity or to leave. Sources say many more workers declined to sign Musk's pledge than he expected, potentially putting Twitter's operations at risk.

Over the past few decades, they've gotten way more powerful, long-lasting and affordable. But all of this is just a prologue to what the next batteries are going to do. As we drive to an increasingly renewable power driven grid, we also need to be able to store energy and release it later to cover those periods of weather intermittencies that are driving this new grid that we're in. It's a multi-trillion dollar opportunity, and it's imperative that we figure out the solution here.

There's that word, metaverse. Good, well, how are you doing? When I think about the metaverse, I think about immersive experiences that have a sense of active presence. Wow, look at this. This is me. The metaverse is projected to become over a trillion dollar market by the end of this decade. And whether you know it or not, you'll probably be working there in the future.

Open everyone a minute to go until the start of cash equity trading in front of what inlanded with Tom McKenzie. And here are your top stories. Bleak outlook. UK Chancellor, Jeremy Hunt lays out 55 billion pounds of tax hikes and spending cuts as Britain's face a record drop in living standards. This sentiment ebbs Asia stocks trim gains as US futures turn lower after James Bullard raises his view on how high the Fed needs to hike rates. Plus the ultimatum backfires Elon Musk's demand for hardcore loyalty, while it prompts an exodus at Twitter and is said to put day-to-day operations at risk. Tom, this is a picture for the future. So we're seeing gains about 2.10% of 8%. I know we look at technology stocks in Asia, but more than that we again look for Fed speakers to give us a sense of what they do with interest rates after it seems that maybe potentially inflation can peak. Yes, James Bullard coming out and outlying an impature for the terminal rate of between five and five and a quarter percent. So raising his view on where the terminal rate will end up, as Francine was saying, building on the core center of those fidd officials pushing back on any idea that you're going to get a pivot or need a pause from the Federal Reserve.

But in terms of how things are shaping up in the first few seconds of the trading sector, you may perhaps therefore fantastic, that we can have it liberticional.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,469,2022-11-18 08:02:02
17856," Pivot or need a pause from the Federal Reserve. Yes, the Asia story ties into this and the China tech story. We'll touch on that briefly. But in terms of how things are shaping up in the first few seconds of the trading session this Friday, the Spanish eyebex is currently up 8 cents of a percent. The FTSE 100 gaining four cents. Yes, some of the consumer data and retail data is coming stronger. There may be some market participants that expected. But longer term, given the picture that was outlined yesterday in that autumn statement, how sustainable is that really going to be? The cat-carrot over in France getting 7 cents of a percent. Let's switch it on to see how things are playing out cross asset then. We talked about this divergent picture between European equities and those in the US futures, pointing to currently range bound after some heavier losses in terms of the futures signaling losses. And again, investors adjust to those more hawkish comments from Federal officials. The story over in Asia was that Ali Baba came through with some stronger results than expected. But that rally in Chinese tech over in Hong Kong fading. Currently, the pound is at 119. That's an upside of 4 cents of percent. It's been a choppy session for sterling. UK assets, the gilts and the pound didn't really move a lot. There was a lack of volatility yesterday despite that autumn statement now. The pound is gaining the US 10 year, 376, not a little movement across the yield curve, stateside after the pop-up in yields yesterday. And Brent, $19 a barrel. So that's again, the two tenths of a percent of you are looking for losses this week, trading a little bit lackluster on questions, of course, about that demand holding up as we head into concerns, of course, or increase about a recession, whether we head into one in the US is up for debate. Here in the UK, more baits in. Francine. Tom, federal officials continue to, of course, continue making the case for further rate hikes to combat the hottest inflation in decades. Let's have a listen. Even under these generous assumptions, the policy rate still isn't at a zone that might be considered sufficiently restrictive. To get to this sufficiently restrictive level of policy will need to increase the policy rate further. We are all united in our commitment to getting inflation back down to our 2 percent target. It's an open question of how far we are going to have to go with interest rates to bring that demand down into balance. We have raised interest rates a lot this year, so there's a lot of tightening in the pipeline. We have not felt the full effects yet, and yet inflation is still very high. Well, that, of course, are some of the Fed speakers that we heard in the last couple of days. And I guess there's a bit of a disconnect, which we'll get to Ben Gutridge about the fact that the market is expecting inflation to come down, but at the same time, they believe that we could be talking about cuts at the moment, which is not what the Fed officials are saying at all. And this has been consistent over the last few months. Every time you get a bit of a rally in equity markets, Fed officials come back out and say, hold on to your horses. We still need to see more data, but you're right. We saw that soft to CPI print. The market's then betting on some kind of pausal pivot. Fed officials coming out very strongly and pushing back against that. Let's bring in our guests then in terms of the market analysis. Ben Gutridge asset management director of model portfolio services and Invesco Amir. And Ben, I'm interested in your notes to us. You talk about the fact that you are still overweight equities. Maybe the case for that, as we look at the terminal rate and the expectations, they're going to get a plus 5% handle on the terminal rate stateside. How does that inform your case for overweight US equities? Well, a marginal overweight. I think we have to concede that it could be a difficult hold from here. As you've just pointed out, you know, every time the market enjoys a bit of relief, the Fed speakers do seem to come back and quash that. But I think what we're dealing with is, like inflation remains the number one challenge. And we've seen that maybe the trend has started to turn in the US. And if you look at sort of shorter term data on goods prices, on rents, and it did perhaps even on wages, you know, still elevated, but starting to move lower. And of course, the Fed can still come out and say, you know, we've got to be alert to the inflation risks. But ultimately, I think like a downshift would be necessary in that environment and markets can enjoy relief from that. But Ben, so when you look at that disconnect, right, which is real and has been real for the last 12 months or so, between the markets and what Federal officials are telling us, when does that disconnect stop? And actually, who's right? The markets have been proven right in the past. Well, I mean, to my point about the marginal overweight equities, we think ultimately, you know, the Federal Reserve will have to downshift. But that could take a few more months. Downshift, I mean cut. Oh, sorry, yeah. So a slowing their pace of raising interest rates. I think we've been so conditioned. And I think by...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,470,2022-11-18 08:06:16
17857," But that could take a few more months. Downshift, you mean cut. Sorry, yeah, so a slowing their pace of raising interest rates. I think we've been so conditioned, I think, by guests on this show, by investors that I see that the central banks just aren't here to help us anymore. And therefore, I think they don't actually have to do that much before the markets can, as I said, can enjoy some relief. And so a downshift in the pace of hikes, two 50 basis points, maybe slower into Q1H1 next year, could well be enough to see markets continue to enjoy a bit of relief. And here's where you're against consensus again on the earnings picture, at least versus a lot of the guests that we speak to, which is that you think earnings actually hold up. As the inflation dynamics start to recede, you think earnings can hold up, because we have a lot of guests coming on saying that the forecasts and the projections around earnings are still not realistic in terms of pricing in that downshift. Well, again, you know, this is, I agree, this is contentious, and there are certainly risks to this view. But yeah, I mean, if inflation does move lower, then there is some positive delta for real incomes there that could continue to support demand and continue to support earnings. And look, the labour market may be issuing some signs of weakness in terms of sort of job openings, but really, I think businesses are reluctant to lay off staff, because it's so difficult to find them. So the labour market strength could endure whilst inflation falls, and that would be, you know, a good news story for earnings. I mean, one of the things, and thank you to Valerie for bringing that chart up, before he's basically saying that when you look at six, seven percent, this is James Bollard, it seems to be restrictive. On to the UK as well, the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, outlined his item budget to Parliament yesterday in that address, he confirmed that the economy will slow next year. They also judge that the UK, like other countries, is now in recession. Overall this year, the economy is still forecast to grow by 4.2%. GDP then falls in 2023 by 1.4%. Let's get back to Ben. Ben, is there anything in UK assets that look undervalued right now? Well, depending on your time horizon, most of it, I would say, there's still some cheapness in UK equities that, for the long-term investor, you know, has appealed, but of course in the short-term, as we're all so acutely aware, you know, the ongoing trend is of sort of the consumer squeeze crisis in sort of living standards that makes sort of the domestic UK economic story really challenging, which would lean against taking a really bold view on UK equities at this moment. But of course, there is cheapness there. So, you know, on that basis, you know, relatively sort of neutral on the fence view, I'm afraid. But generally that valuation call around UK, it takes you to the mega-cats, the FTSE 100E, or are you starting to look at FTSE 250? Surely that's not a proper position at this point. Well, I mean, I would say that across the board there is opportunity. Yeah, for sure. I mean, you know, it doesn't take me or indeed Jeremy Hunt to tell you that the UK economy's like got a challenge ahead of itself, but the market has, you know, as it does, we'll sort of move ahead of that. But, you know, investors have just got to be prepared for volatility in that asset class, but certainly over a longer term horizon. You know, the pound is cheap, and I think on a relative basis, that's good news for UK assets. But of course, you know, the dollar story and reigns sort of quite robust at the moment given the growth challenges and geopolitical challenges we have. What's the value proposition for FTSE 250 company that actually has, you know, very little outward selling points and is dealing with all of the challenges, including high cost of living, mortgages going up, but also not finding the right staff? Well, I mean, it's not a really easy story to tell. I mean, this is, you know, a valuation angle, rather than one that I can say, you know, there is a consumer recovery, we're on the cusp of a consumer recovery story. You know, the markets, I would just say, are relatively well-breed on the idea that the UK consumer is facing a challenging period. OK, the valuation call there from Ben Guthrie's. I know you're bullish the pound as well. It's playing out at least in the session today. The pound currently up about 410% at 119. Ben Guthrie, thank you very much indeed.

Happy Friday everyone. European stocks getting some 4.10 of 8%. Again it's all about what theres a lot biggerhana point on economy. We have a question from an Australiaunal, who were tacticaluls after several years of increasing financial income. Has some of Africa already control that flow? 어느 new question from Labour. I'm quoting hardware work environment What is the state of Twitter at this point? Is this company even going to survive? It may survive the weekend at May night. If you're on Twitter and you see the salute emoji, that is the emoji that many Twitter employees are giving out on the internal Slack. Undone Twitter itself saying, I'm out of here. That's exactly what's happening. I've been trying to save them and automate them. I probably didn't go the way that Elon Musk wanted. To be fair, there will still be people sticking around, including many people who are at Twitter because they have an H1B visa or some kind of visa to keep them in the country. So those who rely on Twitter for their employment visa will probably be sticking around. But Twitter is going to hire people. Elon Musk is going out there and rehiring some of the people he's fired or who've quit. He's going to have some new talents as well. But in the meantime, they've got to really keep it together with kind of chewing gum and rob a bands until he can get a new staff up and running. Tim, how can he actually do that? Could he suspend Twitter until they find new staff or is Twitter a dangerous place in the meantime? Well, in theory, he could suspend it. And it's not like there's a whole lot of people out the back cycling kind of a petal wheel and churning electricity to keep it going. There is service that run it. But as long as they don't do any major software updates and there's no major changes to software in terms of any of the other parts of the puzzle they interact with such as other software vendors, cloud service vendors, network vendors. As long as there's no changes in the software stack itself, there's no real reason why it shouldn't keep going on forever. But software doesn't stay still. Things do change. We have heard that Musk himself has declared that there shall be no changes to the production code, the stuff that actually runs live on a server. And if that's the case, that would certainly mitigate any chances of failure or collapse. But at some point in time, things will change and maybe it'll be a week, maybe a few weeks. And the staff who are left there will be the ones trying to manage that infrastructure to make sure it does keep ticking over. Yeah, with Garmin's sticky tape, as you've suggested, Tim, there's the internal dynamics and everything that's playing out with Intuita. And then there's the external dynamics and the pro potential probe into Musk's purchase of this business. Do we know anything else about that? What kind of challenge and headwind that can provide for Musk going forward? Well, this idea that there's some kind of national security implication has been floating around a while. But, you know, until something serious or formal has been, you know, launched, it is a little bit hearsay. There's reasons to believe that there might be some national security concerns. But if you're going to look into Twitter, there's so many other deals to look into as well. So I think we really need to wait and see and not get too excited about that at this stage.

After the previous day's jump, when we heard from Jim Bullard talk about inflation and a lot more policy makers, they said that they should increase interest rates to 5.25% even though inflation may be peaking down. We have that statement from the UK Chancellor yesterday. There was some movement around the energy companies because key to that was an announcement that there would indeed be a temporary 45% winful tax on that space. The day, though, some of these players are gaining. There is a bit of relief around the details of this announcement. Now at least they have sureity and certainty around what is coming in terms of those tax increases. The trading is 4.8%.

17861," This is, of course, the interview of the day. The UK Chancellor yesterday, Jeremy Hunt has laid bare a bleak new reality for the UK economy, one played by weak growth and rising taxes for years to come. Here's what he had to say about the outlook. They also judge that the UK, like other countries, is now in recession. Overall this year, the economy is still forecast to grow by 4.2%. GDP then falls in 2023 by 1.4%. Joining us now is the UK shadowed Chancellor of the Extracurriker Labour's Rachel Reeves. Thank you so much for joining us, Shadow Chancellor. When you look at what was announced yesterday from Jeremy Hunt, when you look at some of the broader church or certainly taxation and broader shoulders, is this a labour policy? Well, first of all, I'm very concerned about the outlook for the UK economy, for unemployment, economic growth and also inflation, incredibly difficult times for families and also for businesses. In terms of the choices that were made yesterday, more could have been done to make these fair choices and to ease some of that pressure on ordinary working people. So, for example, I said that if you make Britain your home, you should pay your taxes here and Labour would have abolished the non-dom tax status. Additionally, the reduction in the bank's surcharge at a time when banks are making big profits because of the rises in interest rates, that was not the right priority in yesterday's autumn statement. And if you made different choices, then you could have eased some of that pressure that is seeing ordinary incomes being eroded twice now, first by double-digit inflation, and second by the stealth taxes that the Chancellor introduced on those incomes yesterday. Okay, so Rachel, those are some of the things, the changes that maybe you would have made. Presumably though you do support the windfall tax on the energy sector, you support the additional funding for the NHS, you support the additional funding for education and presumably you support the higher tax rate for higher earners. Well, if you look at the windfall tax, for example, you'll know that Labour have been advocating that for a year now, I first called for it in January, but there are still windfalls of war that are being left on the table. The investment allowances, for example, mean that some of the big energy giants are still not paying any windfall tax. And that is wrong, because every pound left on the table that could have been got through a windfall tax on the energy giants, is a pound more that people are paying on their gas and electricity bills. So we would make that system fairer to bring in more money to help people with their bills over the next few months and potentially years, but just on the energy issue, you know, the short-term sticking plaster approach of this government, it just isn't good enough. We should be insulating people's homes. We could have insulated two million in the last year, and that would take up to a thousand pounds of people's bills, not just for one year, but permanently. We need to be investing here in Britain in the cheapest form of energy, and that is renewables with floating offshore wind, with the moratorium on onshore wind being lifted, with investment in green hydrogen. There are big opportunities for Britain in these industries of the future, and the government aren't seasoning it. Shadow Chancellor, what would you do about mortgage rates? Well, the big challenge on mortgage rates came when the last Prime Minister and Chancellor introduced their mini budget just two months ago, and that created, as you well know, wild volatility in financial markets, with government-borne costs rising, and borrowing costs for ordinary families rising in businesses too. I think the Resolution and Foundation have said that the permanent damage done by that has left a £30 billion black hole in the government finances, and mortgage rates are still not back to where they were before that mini budget. So that's why Kia Stammer and me have said that economic stability and security are the number one priorities. It's why I set out a set of fiscal rules that an incoming Labour government would stick with. Would you keep the stamp duty cut that Jeremy...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,475,2022-11-18 08:27:51
17862," Are the number one priorities? It's why I set out a set of fiscal rules that an e-coming Labour government would stick with. Would you keep the stamp duty card that Jeremy Hunt is ending? No, we wouldn't have introduced it in the first place. And I've said that previously, that again is money that could be used to help ordinary people who are seeing their day-to-day taxes increase. So that was one of the few measures that the Chancellor actually kept from Liz Trusses and quasi-quarting's mini budget. And I think that was a mistake. Some of the credibility that was clearly lost after the Liz Truss budget has been restored, at least partially within the markets. Part of that is down to the spending cuts that have been committed to by the current government. A lot of those spending cuts being pushed back into the second half of their term, or at least pushing potentially pushed the election, would you commit to those spending cuts? Well, first of all, you're way you introduced that was interesting. You know, they're partially brought back some of their credibility. What a mess this country is in. We've had 12 years of Conservative government, 12 weeks of utter chaos. And it is ordinary working people and businesses that are paying the price for that volatility, that chaos that we've seen in recent weeks. And the next election, people will be asking themselves and me and my family better off with a Conservative government. And the answer will be no. In terms of where we are at the next election, I've already set out to you and in the response to the statement yesterday. Some of the different choices that Labour would make, for example, are on tax. But I'd also say this, in the last year, as Shadow Chancellor, I've responded now to four budgets. And by the next election, we may have another four. We may have another eight. We just don't know. I've said that because of the mess that the Tories have made, that Labour might not be able to do everything it wants as quickly as possible. And we have a set of fiscal rules that an incoming Labour government would abide to. But I'm not going to set out our plans for the next election and the next manifesto right now, because the path of the UK economy is so uncertain right now that it would potentially be out of date before. I could write it all down. Well, one boost for the UK economy would be rejoining the customs union and the single market. Will you start to advocate for that? No, because I want to be Chancellor of the Exchequer rather than Shadow Chancellor and the country voted to leave the European Union. The issue now is to fix the mess that the government have made of our trading relationship with Europe. And there are a number of things that government could do to improve that. We need a veterinary deal to reduce some of those delays at the border, not just for agricultural companies, but for all businesses. Our services are our biggest export and yet there was no deal for the service sector in the Brexit agreement that the government secured. So we would look to get the mutual recognition of professional qualifications, UK participation in the horizon scheme, reducing the bureaucracy for our fantastic creative industries at the moment find it difficult to tour across Europe. Those are just some of the practical changes that would improve trade between us and our nearest neighbours and trading partners. And just a whole different approach where we see other European countries as friends and allies and partners to improve the relationship rather than constantly trying to find division. And that would see a boost to our economy, our competitiveness and our trade with the European countries. Can you quantify for us how much Brexit is actually weighing on the UK economy? Well, I was an economist in a former life, but I haven't done my own forecast, but I've looked at the Office for Budget Responsibility and other people's forecasts that show that the Brexit deal that the government has secured has cost our economy dearly. And that's why we want to fix some of those holes in that Brexit mess to improve trading relations to make our economy more competitive and ensure that British businesses can't just survive, which is a challenge for many at the moment, that actually thrive in the economy.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,476,2022-11-18 08:32:14
17863, competitive and ensure that British businesses can't just survive which is a challenge for many at the moment to actually thrive in the economy that we are in today. Okay Rachel Reeves we appreciate your time thank you very much indeed UK shadow chancellor of the exchequer with that response to the autumn statement let's check in on these markets then I'll start with a FTSE 100 given that conversation you can't be seeing very modest gains of two tenths of a percent again within the energy space you've seen a bit of relief on the assessment around that 45% windfall tax from the chancellor so that's a 3 tenths of a percent gain across the FTSE 100 more broadly across the European stocks benchmark you've seen gains of five tenths of a percent stateside though S&P Eamonies counting down a tenth of a percent and as that futures in similar territory are francing we've been discussing this of course the conversation at least the pushback from Fed officials James Bullard suggesting that you have to get to at least five to five and a quarter percent in terms of the terminal rate that pushback from a Fed officials around some of the sentiment within these markets that maybe you're close to a pause or a pivot yeah and we've seen this actually over the last 12 months right the fact that the markets believe that when you reach peak inflation then interest rate hikes will ease off and then you hear from officials and frankly also former governors of you know maybe the bank of England or even former ECBs and saying even if you want to reach your target it still means aggressive cuts and this is why you have this economy between what you know the speeches and the Fed officials are saying what the markets are seeing indeed and when it comes to the ECB there is an expectation our own reporting that you're going to get 50 basis points are a step down from 75 basis points to 50 basis points later this month we are waiting for Madame Lagarde of course of the ECB who's going to be giving a speech any moment now check on the euro briefly because the single currency is currently down a tenth of a percent currently trading at 1.03 the pound by the way gaining 3.10% at 1.18 will keep across some of the other asset classes as well in terms of your treasuries and the yield curve after the run up of yields yesterday again tying into that commentary from Fed officials you're seeing yields up just around two basis points at the front end 4.47 on your US two year the 10 year 378 that's a move high by two basis points briefly looking at guilt as well yields up five basis points at the front end 3.16 again investors still digesting the fallout of the autumn statement from the chance let the 10 year guilt 3.23 that's a move higher by three basis points friends now some of the other things we're watching yesterday in the US we had some fresh data showing weekly jobless claims for example came below the forecast further underscoring the strength of the labor market so I think if you look at country by country is certainly region by region it's very different if you're sitting in the US I'm looking at US mortgage rates and they were posting their biggest weekly decline since 1981 and that briefly improved sentiment but when you look at where we are you just need to think about a affordability and we're just having a great conversation there with the shadow chance of the extracurricular reefs about what you'd be doing with mortgage rates and also it was interesting to to hear or you know say about Brexit I'm saying well look we can't reverse this because I want to be chance of the fact that it often feels like you know Brexit is a bad word that can't be uttered if you want to be elected the conspiracy of silence as I think the financial times put it but it was really fascinating response and it points to that determination of course to get into power but the risks around as they say within the Labour Party of addressing that issue even as the polls suggest that people are increasingly distant chanted with the fallout of of Brexit now we are getting some lines from Madame regard of the ECB saying that the risk of recession has increased for Anne C recession unlikely to quell inflation significantly so we'll hear from them in a gal that very shortly but first let's get straight to the

German burns, you're seeing a move up just by three basis points. BTPs on the 10 year 398. That's a move higher by five basis points. All right, we're going to come to a break now and come back, hopefully, with Madame Lagarde of the ECB. Let's stay with us, this is Bloomberg. MUSIC All right, you are in for a treat. We're not going to break. We're going to go straight to the ECB president, Madame Lagarde. Let's listen in. Cher Christian. Dier Mr. Triche, Cher Jean-Claude. Dier Mrs. Foust. Dier Mr. Scholes. And to all of you ladies and gentlemen, good morning. Thank you to the EBC for bringing us back together. I'm sure you've heard that many times. How much more pleasant it is to be together. I'll share with you a comment that I heard a couple of days ago in a similar circumstance, where just like with us at the EBC, thank you for inviting me, we had not met physically for three years. And that person who is knowing us all thank you for that. I didn't recognize anything. zu Dier.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,478,2022-11-18 08:41:12
17865," We're just like with us at the EVC. Thank you for inviting me. We had not met physically for three years. And that person very kindly looked at me and said, you are older, but you look better. So I turn it over to you. We are all a bit older, but we are looking a lot better than on those awful screens. So it is my pleasure to speak to you this morning. And I want to thank you very much, Christian, for this kind introduction and for the very clear speech that you delivered with multiple messages that I'm sure many of us will in the course of the day continue to develop, but it is really a pleasure to be here. When the former British Prime Minister Harold McMillan was asked what the greatest challenge was for a statement, he's known to have said events, dear boys, events. And indeed, as policymakers, we are constantly faced with unpredictable events and shocks. But what makes the situation we face today, especially challenging, is that we are not just facing a sequence of incredible shocks, ill-fated events I would call them, the pandemic, the energy crisis, Russia's unjustifiable invasion of Ukraine. Thank you, Madame Deputy Mayor, for your words on that topic. And of course, high inflation. But as a result of that, the environment that we are operating in is changing profoundly. Some of the major trends that characterize the past few decades are shifting or even reversing. In particular, we can no longer assume, at least in the near future, that global supply will gradually expand, or that global demand will act as a shock absorber. And this, as implications, for the focus of macroeconomic policy in the years to come. Today, what I will try to do is argue that three themes will matter, one, ensuring price stability as the different shocks play out. Two, lifting constraints on growth in the areas where they have emerged. And three, safeguarding a resilient financial sector, which can support the transitions we will face. I will spend a bit more time on the first of these three items, as you can imagine, because for the ECB, displaying our commitment to our mandate is vital to ensure that inflation expectations remain anchored while inflation is high. We are committed to bringing inflation back down to our medium to our target. And we will take all the necessary measures to do that. Rest assured. But in order to overcome the ongoing challenges, other public and private players will need to help accelerate the transition to that greener, more digital, more productive economy that we all aspire to. So let's have a quick look at the changing environment, which has been alluded to by Madame Deb Kutie-Mayer and by Christian saving. But I'll focus on a couple of them, which matter for us. One, probably of the most important macroeconomic stories of the past 30 years has been the rising interconnectedness of the global economy and its implications for global supply and global demand. China's entry in the global economy, particularly, has offered joining the WTO, led to a massive increase in global labor supply. Global supply chains became more unbundled and efficient, lowering inventory levels and reducing costs. And energy markets changed fundamentally as well as new producers emerged.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,479,2022-11-18 08:45:12
17866," century levels and reducing costs. And energy markets changed fundamentally as well as new producers emerged. Notably, shale oil and gas, particularly in the United States, making global oil and gas supply significantly more elastic. At the same time, globalization allowed growth to become less beholden to swings in domestic demand as countries could rotate demand towards the rest of the world when faced with domestic slums. This proved especially valuable in Europe in the wake of the sovereign debt crisis. Between 2010 and 2014, external demand as a share of Euro-area GDP more than doubled. When it was tough at home, we looked elsewhere and it worked. These two forces meant that inflation became unusually low and stable. A floor under demand meant that major busts in domestic demand resulted in less volatile inflation. And elastic supply meant that major booms, such as the one we saw before the Great Financial Crisis, did not produce serious inflationary pressures. Now we are facing a new environment. New supply constraints have a reason in the global economy, owing to supply chain disruptions, zero-covid policies, still surviving in some corners, energy production cuts and the unacceptable Russia's invasion of Ukraine. And in this context, swings in demand caused by the closing and reopening of the economy have hit a wall. Rather than quantities increasing to much demand as we had seen before, prices have surged instead. And that is a key reason why alongside rising energy prices, inflation has returned so fiercely. We know that some of these constraints will fade over time. We are already beginning to see, for example, shipping costs declining, delivery times shortening. But other changes may well be more persistent. The shocks triggered by the pandemic and the war are creating what I have called a new global map of economic relationships. And in this environment, it is uncertain whether a seamless expansion of supply will continue and how global demand will be affected. And I would like to focus on two shifts that are characteristics of this new global map. There are others, but I want to focus on these two. The first one is what I call from efficiency to security of global supply chain. And the second is from dependence to diversification and it will not surprise that you that I would focus on energy. From efficiency to security, this is reflected in the new industrial policy that in the very recent years have prioritized geopolitical goals over efficiency constraints. Many advanced economies are coming to see their past de-industrialization as vulnerability, leading to a push to reshore, close shore, French shore, however you name it, those industries that are regarded as strategic. And the definition of strategic has had multiple dimensions as we can remember from the COVID crisis. This is likely to increase cost and affect production while supply chain are adjusting. At the same time, this shift could cast doubt on China's role as a source of global demand, de-presing monopoly on technology.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,480,2022-11-18 08:49:32
17867," The three themes that I have mentioned are crucial. Are crucial if they are developed consistently and together. First one, ensuring price stability as the different shocks play out. Second, lifting constraints on growth in the areas where they have emerged and three safeguarding the resilient financial sector which can support the transition we will face. I have to tell you, each of these three themes would warrant an extra speech. So you'll re-invite me. Maybe I could replace Christian... No, sorry. I didn't mean to say that. So let me focus on the first one which is ensuring price stability. For monetary policy, this changing environment creates considerable challenges. You've mentioned that very kindly. I was attending a wonderful dinner last night and most people I spoke to said, we really don't want to be new shoes. It gives a better measure of the challenge that we are facing. When nobody wants to take your job, there's something. Inflation in the Euro area is far too high. It has reached double digits in October for the first time since the start of the monetary union. And with inflation likely to remain high for an extended period, we need to monitor the evolution of inflation expectations very carefully. Additionally, although recent data on GDP growth have surprised on the upside, yet the risk of recession has increased. But historical experience suggests that a recession is unlikely, unlikely, to bring down inflation significantly, at least in the short run. So in this setting, displaying commitment to our mandate is vital to ensure that inflation expectations remain anchored, and that second round effects do not take hold. And that is why we have been raising rates at the fastest pace ever by already 200 basis points in our last three policy meetings. These rate increases help us to withdraw support for demand more quickly. And they send a clear signal to the public of our determination to bring down inflation, which will help anchor expectations. Yes, we expect to raise rates further. And with drawing accommodation may not be enough. Ultimately, we will raise rates to levels that bring inflation back down to our medium-term target in a timely manner. As I explained recently, how far we need to go, how fast we'll be determined by the inflation outlook. This is forward-looking and incorporates all the different forces that we are facing. The outlook for the economy, the persistence of the shocks, the reaction of wages and inflation expectations, as well as the proper transmission of our policy stance. Interest rates are and will remain the main tool for adjusting our policy stance. But we also need to normalize our other policy tools and so reinforce the impulse from our rate policy. And that is why we recently decided to amend the terms and conditions of our targeted longer-term refinancing operations. The targeted longer-term refinancing operations addressed the need for significant stimulus during the pandemic, strengthening the transmission of rates to the economy via banks. The targeted longer-term refinancing operations addressed the need for significant stimulus during the pandemic,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,481,2022-11-18 08:56:38
17868," The need for significant stimulus during the pandemic, strengthening the transmission of rates to the economy via banks. But not the environment has completely changed. And we need to ensure that the lower cost of funding that TELTRA created for banks does not impede monetary transmission when policy normalization is required. Similarly, large-scale asset purchases were necessary to expand the policy stance when interest rates were close to the lower bound. But in the current environment and acknowledging that interest rates remain the most effective tool for shaping our policy stance, it is appropriate that the balance sheets of the central bank is normalized in a measured and predictable way. In December, we will lay out the key principles in sufficient details for reducing the bond holdings in our asset purchase program portfolio. In parallel, our tools for preserving the orderly transmission of our monetary policy, notably the flexible reinvestment of the pandemic emergency purchase program and the new transmission protection instrument will remain in place and available. Turning now to the lifting work that needs to be done. Monetary policy will ensure a timely return of inflation to our medium-term target, but the economic outlook will also depend on the alignment between monetary policy actors and other actors. In the short term, the stance of fiscal policy is important. In this current environment of high inflation, fiscal policy needs to be temporary, targeted and tailored. That is my triplity for you. It should be temporary so that it does not push up demand too much over the medium term. It needs to be targeted so that the size of the fiscal impulse is limited and benefits focused on those who need it most. And it should be tailored so that it does not suppress the price signal that is needed in order to reduce our energy consumption. Looking further ahead, while monetary policy can steer demand, it cannot remove existing constraints on economic growth. Other policy areas will need to act. Removing those constraints will not only rebuild supply that has been impaired by the recent shocks, it will also over time strengthen domestic demand in a world where external demand is becoming less predictable. The drive to speed up three key transitions will determine our future. First, towards cleaner energy. Second, greater economic security. And third, a more digital and productive economy. First, we urgently need to step up investment in clean energy to counterbalance lower investment in fossil fuels and falling Russian supply. And I would suggest, by the way, that some European countries are reasonably well positioned in that respect. But we need to beef up our games. This is not only about increasing domestic energy production, but also about innovation, about developing new technologies that will help us solve the intermeetancy and storage challenges of renewable energies. And in the short term, reforming Europe's energy markets will be critical and is urgent, so as to avoid recurring volatility in energy prices while we diversify away from Russian gas. Second, I agree with you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,482,2022-11-18 09:00:53
17869," Second, I agree with you. Europe's strategic autonomy agenda will be pivotal in making growth more resilient to the changing nature of globalization. In a world fragmenting into blocks, it will allow us to retain access to critical technologies and resources both through reshoring strategic industries and securing strategic alliances. That are well selected and of which cost and benefits are weighted. And that will in turn underpin our energy transition which is highly resource intensive. Let's take the example of the electric vehicle which are just growing significantly at the moment. They use around six times more minerals than conventional cars. Some of them we have, many of them we don't. Hence the importance of operating strategically and selecting our alliances with that purpose. Third, to cope with shrinking global labour supply as well, unfortunately, as our own aging societies, we will have to produce more with less. That is addressing Europe's chronically low productivity growth by boosting our rate of innovation. This will require the rapid digitalisation of the economy in terms of skills and technologies. That is only around half of EU firms, innovated or adopted new technologies in 2021, compared with close to two thirds in the United States. And yes, the capital market union is one way to address those issues because to innovate you clearly need financing and multiple sources of it. Collectively these transitions will require significant investment. The European Commission has estimated that climate-related investment needs alone will amount to almost half a trillion euro on average per year until 2030. And more than a hundred billion per year will be needed to close the digital gap and upskill labour forces and manage the digital transition. So let's not forget this was a few months ago, but it is still there and being used and drawn upon the 750 billion euro's next generation EU fund with its focus on green and digital spending is a good tool for ensuring that investment flows where it is needed over the next few years. But it will ultimately need to be matched and exceeded by higher investment from other sources. Obviously from the private sector, but also most likely by national governments that will play a different role. According to one estimate, the public sector will need to fund between a quarter and a fifth of climate-related investment. This means that when the time comes for national government to consolidate their fiscal policies because that time will come after the triple T, it will make a difference whether they do so by reducing transfers and public consumption and raising taxes or by cutting public investment. If they opt for the latter method, cutting investment, as they did after the great financial crisis, there is a risk that supply will not be rebuilt and constraint of growth will continue to bind. And I will come to my third and final theme, which you have described broadly and which I will just brush upon. Because to support all these transitions, we need a resilient financial sector. As you've indicated, the situation for banks has changed dramatically since the great financial crisis.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,483,2022-11-18 09:05:17
17870," Financial sector. As you indicated the situations for banks has changed dramatically since the great financial crisis. You were there, I was there, I was finance minister for France at the time. And we also are lived through those dramas. Banks were indeed part of the problem. During the pandemic, which was an unparalleled crisis, the banks were at the heart of the solution. Not least, because thanks to more solid and more rigorous regulation, they had stronger capital and liquidity positions. Now, we need banks that continue being part of the solution. So undermining the solid foundation we have built together. It has taken a while, let's face it. We are there. Would not help bring this about. We are facing a fast changing world, characterized by multiple shocks and profound uncertainty. And in this setting, over-deluting regulation would leave banks more exposed to shocks and less able to support the transitions on which our future growth will depend. And that would neither be in the interest of the sector, which ultimately would be less profitable, nor of the economy, which would like the financing needs and would find alternative sources. Because the nature of financial intermediation is changing. And we must ensure that this contributes to the sector resilience, that it doesn't threaten the sector resilience. So let me mention two changes that we see, and where somehow we can be effective. The first one is the digitalization of payments, which is spreading rapidly, not in all countries of Europe, but certainly in a large number of them. That can create opportunities. And I know that some of you are seizing on those opportunities. But it could also pose new types of risks as new players, quite novice in the business, and new products sometimes uncertain, enter the market. Central banks are responding by advancing the development of central bank digital currencies. These currencies could give banks a tool to offer improved products and services, built on the stable foundations of digital public money. Banks will have a role to play in that digital transformation and can seize it. Not to cope with transformation, as is the theme of the day, but to thrive on those transformation. Second, the role of non-bank finance is growing and is a worry. Let's face it. Not just here in Europe, on both sides of the Atlantic. It's here of overall credit, has been rising from 15% in 2009 to 26% nowadays. Now this has to be reflected if only for level playing field reasons and security and protection in a stronger macro-prudential framework for non-banks. Specifically, we need a framework that focuses on building resilience ex-ante rather than relying on exposed measures. There are many other things that I could debate and discuss for you, but my time is counted. So I will conclude at this point. We are indeed entering a new environment, where the forces that created a sustained expansion of global supply and allowed global demand to act as a shock absorber are changing in front of our eyes and probably profoundly.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,484,2022-11-18 09:09:37
17871," Sustain expansion of global supply and allowed global demand to act as a shock absorber are changing in front of our eyes and probably profoundly. The effects of these shifts are uncertain, but the duty of monetary policy is not. The ECB will ensure that a phase of high inflation does not feed into inflation expectations, allowing too high inflation to become entrenched. We have acted decisively, raising rates by 200 basis points and we expect to raise rates further to the levels needed to ensure that inflation returns to our 2% medium-term target in a timely manner. But if we want to rebuild our supply capacity and strengthen domestic sources of growth, other policy areas need to refocus. Most importantly, they need to direct investment towards the transitions that will define our future and the financial sector needs to be able to actively support these transitions. We have joint interest. Consistency between public policy areas remains important in a post-pandemic world. If we respond separately to today's challenges, we risk standing in each other's way. But if we act together, we can rise to those challenges and ensure that our objectives are met and that we seize the opportunity rather than lament about the risks. So maybe for another theme of the EBC for another year, you could change coping with thriving because we can do it. Thank you. Thank you. Yes, Francine Good Morning. This was a very long speech. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,485,2022-11-18 09:13:51
17872," I would not tell, but I would say she was earning a little bit on the hawkish side. It ran on the hawkish. What about the doves here who say it's 200 basis points, it's already a lot. Let's just wait and see the real implications of this. Is that a case to be contemplated? It's a lot very fast. I understand the doves. I'm a dove myself. But I think that at this point they actually want to see evidence that it's working before adopting that position. And can I ask you about QT because she mentioned it. And she talked about a detailed plan. When we talk about a detailed QT plan in December, so that is around the corner. In your view, what does it imply? What does it mean? I think what it meant is we'll give all the information to markets so that they can predict at what pace we will reduce the balance sheet. And a timeline, therefore, dates. That is not clear to me. It could be data dependent too. So that we will see that in December. And it's a very difficult question that I'm going to put to you. But if you get a detailed plan on QT, a 75 basis points hike in December, is that not going to lead to a big market tantrum? Like this bank has gone way too hard, it's very fast. Do the two at the same time. That's potentially risky for markets. I think it all depends on the content of that detailed plan. I think the 75 percent alone will not lead to a tantrum. Okay, and just a final question. She repeated many times. We have a goal in a mandate. That is to bring down inflation. Clearly, they failed this year. A lot of people will tell you they also failed in their assessment. That this was not a one-off, that this was entrenched inflation. I wonder if it's a tough question too. But has she lost some credibility or the institution itself? Clearly, they have lost a little bit of credibility, which is why there is anything her earring on the hawker side now. But when you say they have lost some credibility, is it because of the way they've acted? Is it because of perhaps some of the changes, big changes at times, and in the diagnosis of the situation, or just because of the policy combination itself? Some argue that they lost a big window to high-get the start of the year. I agree with that. So I think that they basically gave themselves a rather confusing instruction in December of last year, which essentially mixed a time-bound pace of hiking with data dependency. And then they were caught up when these two things produced a contradiction. And as a result, even though the data argued for much faster tightening, they stuck to a measured pace. And that hurt them. And that hurt the credibility of the central bank. And I also want to ask you, you know, in a global picture, she did talk about coordination. How does she work with the Fed? It's a tough one. How come the two align? It's a very tough one. I think they would work in a way that their reaction to similar type of data would not be completely inconsistent. But ultimately, they are in different positions. And just a final question. She talked about fiscal policy. We know very well. You know it's your German, but of course you take a whole picture of the European Union as whole fiscal policy in the EU is all over the place. What does the UCB need from a fiscal perspective to get their right policy mix? They need as little stimulus that will push against the tightening. The tightening as possible. So they want fiscal policy to take away the pain of the coming recession to individual groups. They don't want it to fight against monetary policy. Hence the whole emphasis on timely and targeted. Because if fiscal policy ends up being expansionary, what they're going to have to do is tighten even more longer, and then all the risks will increase for the reasons you stated at the beginning. Exactly. Well, Mr. Zadolnyer, thank you so much. Thank you for that very quick reaction to that speech. It came in very handy today. We hope to see you more on Bloomberg TV and of course you're new to your jobs and congratulations on that, too. Francine, of course, the conference continues. Remember, there's also an announcement pending on the tele-trose and the German Finance Minister, Christian Linder, who will be here in the afternoon. So a lot going on here. Yeah, a lot going on. And I know I am sure that you will keep us abreast of all the new developments. Thanks so much, Maria, today. Frank, for now, let's turn back to the UK. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt, to lay bare a bleak new reality for the country's economy and his autumn statement, one plagued by weak growth and rising taxes for years to come. The UK's shadow, Chancellor of the Extracurricular, Rachel Reeves spoke to us earlier. What a mess this country is in. We've had 12 years of Conservative Government, 12.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,486,2022-11-18 09:18:35
17873," The UK's shadow chancellor, the extracurricular, he spoke to us earlier. What a mess this country is in. We've had 12 years of Conservative government, 12 weeks of utter chaos, and it is ordinary working people and businesses that are paying the price for that volatility, that chaos that we've seen in recent weeks. And the next election, people will be asking themselves, and me and my family, better off with a Conservative government, and the answer will be no. Well, to talk about the UK, we're joined by Guillermo Filices, global investments for NHSEP, PGM, Fixed Income, and Bloomberg's John Stepig. So thank you both for joining us. John, first of all, can you just lay out what we heard yesterday? So it does seem like it's the middle-income households that are squeezed the most by the new fiscal plan. Yeah, it was pretty gloomy. And what actually happened is the Jeremy Hunt backloaded the vast majority of the consolidation until after the next election for obvious reasons. But the people are getting hit right now are the kind of people in middle incomes. And that's largely down in fiscal drag, which is where you freeze tax thresholds, and it means that because inflation's so high, a lot more people get dragged into higher income tax and other tax bonds than the otherwise would have. So Guillermo, what does this mean from an investment point of view? I love this panel because we're looking at how people are getting squeezed, and this is what John Stepig does for it at Bloomberg. He also has a great newsletter looking at money distilled. So we talk about wealth, but for international investors, Guillermo, I don't know when the right time to go in is. Yeah, look, I think this statement, the liver on two fronts that I think are really important for the investment community. One is reassuring that the UK is physically responsible. And the second one is just making sure that there's confidence in the market. We have an episode of market malfunctioning. And this statement addresses those two issues. So at least the headlines I think are very reassuring for both international and domestic investors. But there's other problems that we can touch on, but the big headlines I think are. I was going to say, Guillermo, you're very optimistic to say that it's reassuring. The outlook is very grim. There is, of course, at least help for the needy. They're taxing the rage. There's a squeeze on energy firms, corporate tax hikes. There's a break for banks. Market's pretty much unimpressed. So again, foreign investor, what's the right time? When do you call it bottom, Guillermo? When's the right time to come in? No, so look, it depends on the asset. So we cannot deny that the UK is going through a very, very tough patch. We're entering a recession. We're facing higher interest rates. So for yields, for example, or corporate debt in the UK, it's definitely a difficult time. That's why it's kind of emphasizing, first, you need to make sure you make sure that you have a credible fiscal and monetary policy mix. I think that's what the UK is achieving. Now, in terms of whether there's value at this level, say, for yields or for corporate debt, I would be a little bit more cautious there. So I think for now things are coming down, but I think I wouldn't jump into these markets yet. Yeah. John, if you break it down for us, and I think we had a survey by resolution saying, for example, typical household, faces a permanent 3.7% income hit from these measures, bigger than the 3% hit that the top 20th will face. Yeah, well, I mean, dude, so the top percent, obviously, they've experienced income tax cut in the 45% tax rate. So that's going down from £150,000 to £125,140. But the real problem is these people who are in the middle, because what I think often people don't understand is that they're actually massive marginal tax rates, especially in the bracket between about 50 and 100, 000 pounds. So if you're earning 50, 000 pounds or over and you get child benefit, when child benefit gradually gets taken away, that creates a margin-link on tax rate at the 50, 000 pound area of about 60% rather than 40%. Similar thing happens at 100,000 pounds, you start to get your personal allowance taken away, which is the amount of money you can earn tax. Free, that again creates a 60% marginal income tax rate for anyone on 100,000 pounds up to 125. So people are already equates.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,487,2022-11-18 09:22:46
17874," That again creates a 60% marginal income tax rate for anyone on £100,000 up to 125. So people are already quite squeezed and with inflation rising at double-digit rates, and even wage inflation to be rid of going up at 6% a year, many, many more people are going to get pushed into those rates. So they're paying more tax even though in real terms, they're actually not earning them more than the fact they're earning less. John, and I know we don't have a crystal ball and I know it's a difficult question, but when does it get better? I mean, I think, I always think this is why Jeremy Hunt is back loaded so much of this stuff, because he's hoping that he's not going to have to do it. He's hoping that come 2024 things will look a bit better. He's also made sure these kept mortgage rates down. I think that's the other key thing about this. I mean, what Gwile almost saying about markets is absolutely correct. The point is that guilt yields haven't gone up, which means that mortgage rates aren't going to get any worse. And I think that was the big retail investor consumer facing thing. But yeah, basically, he's hoping that come 2024 things will look better, and then hopefully the Tories from his point of view can get back in power. We have it until 2024. Graham, what do you think it gets better in terms of inflation? Like, what's the prescription to fix the UK right now? There's a huge labour shortage. The labour market is extremely tight. Is it more immigration? How do you fix this very fundamental problem? Yeah, unfortunately, we're seeing inflation coming up from two big sources. One is domestically generated inflation. You know, linked to the reopening of the pandemic and all that. And of course, the externally generated inflation linked to the war in Ukraine, higher energy prices and all that. And you've mentioned a third one, actually, that is really, really important, which is the tightness that we see in labour markets, because part of it also breaks it. We cannot deny that the supply side we're seeing a shock that is not going to be any time soon. It's going to be more of a permanent shock. So the inflation process is likely to be quite a long drawn return to normality. I guess we can have some return to normality from the external sources. If things normalize on the commodities front, but unfortunately, we're facing some shocks that are more permanent here. Guiyama, are you buying anything on the gilt curve right now? No, not really. And what really worries me is basically the issuance schedule that we have into next year. So if you look at the amount numbers we're facing, quite a huge issuance into 2023-24. And to me, that calls big questions about market functioning further down the line. So what has to be really, really careful about how that risk premium in the gilt curve, I mean, UK assets more broadly gets reprised. So still very cautious here. What are you focusing on in your newsletter from now on, John? Is there anything at the margins that we spoke to the shadow chance of the extracurre? I mean, she kind of pushed back, but also there's just a basic kind of understanding that the detouries are stealing one of the ideas that Labour would have put in place in the past. Yeah, but I mean, that was another interesting thing about the budget yesterday, is that a lot of people were saying that that could have been a labor budget, you know, taking money from the rich and giving it to the kind of this struggling. But I think from our point of view, they think we're going to be focusing on from for our readers is, you know, how do you try to... Because at the end of the day, it is aimed at people who are in this bracket where they're going to get dragged by fiscal drag. So how can you cope with that and how can you avoid it ideally? All right, thank you both for joining us. We're going to have a few more releases there, a global investment stretch at PGM Fixed Income. Also thanks to our very own John Steppick and check out the newsletter. What's it called? Money distilled. Money distilled. Good read, everyone should read it. This is a picture overall for the markets. Now, equities actually pairing some of the gains. European equity futures or European equity stocks are gaining around 9-10th of 8 percent. US futures also pretty much stable. Now, coming up in Alta-Maitem from Elon Musk, it's said to have resulted in an exodus of employees putting the companies up.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,488,2022-11-18 09:27:06
17875," 9th, 8% US futures are also pretty much stable. Now coming up and ultimately from Elon Musk, it's said to have resulted in an exodus of employees putting the company's operations at risk. We'll have plenty more on that next. Let's do this then, this is blurry. What do you think of when you think of a battery? For most it's what we use to power devices for both work and play and maybe even your car. Over the past few decades they've gotten way more powerful, long lasting and affordable. But all of this is just a prologue to what the next batteries are going to do. As we drive to an increasingly renewable power driven grid, we also need to be able to store energy and release it later to cover those periods of weather intermittencies that are driving this new grid that we're in. It's a multi trillion dollar opportunity and it's imperative that we figure out the solution here. How we store energy on a massive scale is in many ways the central challenge of the fight to stop climate change. We're in the early stages of a sustainability revolution that has the magnitude of the industrial revolution coupled with the speed of the digital revolution. Nobody covers climate change like Bloomberg, your global business authority. Bleak Outlook, the UK Chancellor, Jeremy Hunter lays out 55 billion pounds of tax hikes and spending cuts as Britain's face a record drop in the big standards. Rick's sentiment ebbs, Asia stocks, trim gains as U.S. futures turn lower after James Bullard raises his view on how high the Fed needs to high-grates. Plus the ultimate and backfires Elon Musk's demand for hardcore loyalty prompts an exodus head Twitter and is said to put day-to-day operations at risk. Well, good morning everyone and welcome to Bloomberg's surveillance early edition and from Sinlaquois here in London. So many workers have chosen to go than he expected and that's leading to major complications.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,489,2022-11-18 09:31:29
17876," The line has now passed and sources tell Bloomberg that so many more workers have chosen to go than he expected and that's leading to major complications. What's winning us now is Alex Webb from Bloomberg Quick Take. Alex, so what exactly is he dealing with? First of all, what are we talking about hardcore? Like people left because they didn't like his antics or because they were afraid of working too hard. Well, we don't know that sort of that motivation. So we know what he was saying. He expected from people, namely, yes, incredibly long hours. The sort of adjacent maybe to this this 996 philosophy you get in Asia where you know you're expected to work incredibly long days and six days a week. There have been far more, the Bloomberg is reporting far more departures than we're expected. The risks that poses is not necessarily they don't have the head count because you know there are lots of people floating around Silicon Valley right now who have lost their jobs and maybe you can review some of those. But it's people don't they don't necessarily have people who know their systems right that actually they know where things are buried they know how to how to fix problems. So it's talked to us a little bit about the workforce of Twitter because we all know it. I mean it's pretty self-sufficient one more thing because people just go on and write. But this is what is safeguarding its engineers. It's people I guess that you know arbitring and disputes. But there are lots of different obviously, but then you come lots of different departments one that most a lot of people compared about is content concerned about sorry is content moderation that if you complain about something or you notice content that is not appropriate or frankly that there is just proactive moderation of content. There aren't going to be enough people to do that. That's the first thing secondly Elon is trying to iterate on the product itself improve the product. You therefore need the engineers to do that to actually come up with the new systems and thirdly then you just need the administration. So Alex, how significant is this problem? Could we see could regulators step in? Would Elon Musk suspend Twitter for a couple of days? Like what's the way forward? Well, we certainly know the regulators are already looking at the deal for national security reasons partly to do with some of the comments that Elon Musk made about Russia and Ukraine. I suppose having started that process they can also then look at other piece fit. Look, I don't really know what Elon's going to do. I don't think Elon knows what Elon's going to do. He didn't anticipate. Certainly the report is just he didn't anticipate the scale of the departures that we've seen. The one thing that's crucially different from Twitter compared to the other companies that he runs is that he basically more or less founded those companies. Tesla, he didn't quite found but he was there very early when that weren't many employees. That means he forged the corporate culture at those companies. He's coming into now this place which has its own corporate culture trying to impose a new one upon it and clearly that electric shock is creating a little bit of problem. So what do we know about sponsors? Are they leaving the platform or are you know users like you and I leaving the platform? So brands are very concerned about this. I was actually speaking to Martin Sorrel last week, the former CEO of WPP. He was saying and I was asking about the World Cup and he said brand given the control of his surrounding it. He said that brands are less concerned about the World Cup than they are about Twitter that they are pulling back some less spend on Twitter to what to wait and see. See what happens. That doesn't mean they're going to be gone forever but certainly for now they're taking you hit and that's a problem for Elon Musk because he has to find $1.2 billion to services debt obligations. Every year. At the moment, Twitter's forecast to have negative free cash flow assumes that if advertisers are disappearing, that negative free cash flow is only going to get worse. Is there another platform that people are looking into as a new Twitter? Well, I mean Twitter, don't forget, is a small company, right? It has 200 and something million daily active users. Its revenue is less than BT's profit. It is not a big company in that scale of things. All the brands and the users have already been fleeing not just to Facebook historically but to TikTok, a little bit to Snapchat. All of these places have become more appealing than Twitter. There was a core user group at Twitter, media types, politicians. They really like it. They are still quite good for them and they tend to move a little bit more slowly than the early adopters we see in other platforms. Alex, thanks so much Alex Web. They are from Bloomberg Quicktake talking us through the Travelles of Twitter. Now joining us now is Danny Rumor, he is partner index ventures of tech focus VC firm behind Dropbox, Robin Hood, Etsy Deliveroo, but also Glossier. Danny, thank you so much for joining us. What happens to Twitter? Nice to see you, Francine. What happens to Twitter? Twitter is a very resilient platform. One of the things that we have to remember is that online folks continually use the platform. I think it's up in the year what happens to it. I certainly think that Elon hasn't done anything to give comfort and confidence in Twitter, but...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,490,2022-11-18 09:35:49
17877," I think it's up in the year, what happens to it, I certainly think that Elon hasn't done anything to give comfort and confidence in Twitter, but it's still a very important platform on a global basis. So the question is, how relevant it will be? That's a big question. Whether it's going to be around, that's not such a big question. So, Danny, what you're also on to talk about today is basically the VC funding environment. So we're talking about valuations. There's been a number of layoffs, of course, in the tech space, including at Twitter. When do you expect a stabilization of this space? And what does it mean for VCs wanting to get in there? We're announcing this new seed fund of ours called Index Origin 2. It's the second one raised after 18 months. So it's a $300 million fund committed to early seed investments. So what I was going to say is that when we look at the world, we're really looking at it from a micro lens. And this is a phenomenal time to start companies. So while larger companies are skimming the fat, are right sizing, are having to, in many cases, do some very important layoffs. Of course, there are some companies that are still growing in this period. But on the seed side, when you're really an entrepreneur trying to start a company, this is an unusually good time. Why? Because actually, you know, from the outside, and we talk about this all over the place and every day, it's the currencies are very volatile. It's difficult to find staff. So where do you see the biggest value? Like, why would you do it now when you're a cost of living crisis and inflation going up? Well, I would say a few things. The first is, when you're an entrepreneur, you're not the most rational. You've been placed on this earth to start a company that you think is going to disrupt the space. I mean, you mentioned Etsy and you mentioned Glossier and you mentioned Figma, Robin Hood. Those entrepreneurs really started companies because they thought the world needed it. And if they were just thinking of a rational time, we'd probably not have a new bar or an Airbnb today or a Skype today. Those companies were started in this type of period. And actually, when it comes to great employees, great partners to start a company, anyone who joins a startup right now means it. They're not there for a quick buck. They're not being mercenary or think that this is the right place to be. They're doing it because they mean it and they're really... I've always been told that the difference between a good entrepreneur and a great entrepreneur is the money behind it so that if it is a good idea and they're focused on execution, they can scale up quite quickly. Is there enough capital to go around right now? I don't know who is telling you that, but I could not disagree more. Actually, from our perspective, the successive companies have been inversely proportional to the amount that they raised. So the less money they raised in the earlier rounds, the more successful those companies have been. And if we take those companies that we've been talking about in every single case, they were single-digit financings rather than big financings. I think one of the major problems when you're starting a company is if you have too much money, you're not as creative, you're not as agile, you're not as... You don't have the same hustle mentality. So we really encourage folks to start small and in fact with index origin, too, the investments are from one to five million dollars and no more. Okay, I like this. So if you're an entrepreneur and you're going through tough time, Daniel Ramirez says, guys, you could be the next billionaire. How do you spot pure talent? How do you decide where to invest money in with an entrepreneur? Like, what's left to disrupt? Well, one of them is, you know, if they're starting a company because they want to be a billionaire, then they probably shouldn't start a company. They have to start it because they really believe that they have something better to provide the world. You know, the founders of a Figma of this company that just sold to Adobe for $20 billion Dylan when I met him at 19. He didn't want to be a billionaire. He wanted to provide.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,491,2022-11-18 09:40:04
17878," of a Figma, this company that just sold to Adobe for $20 billion, Dylan, when I met him at 19, he didn't want to be a billionaire. He wanted to provide design tools to the world. So that's what I would tell them. Make sure that you're in it for the long haul. Make sure you're aware that there are going to be ups and downs. And make sure you surround yourself with folks who know more than you and who are different from you because you're going to need them. And you're going to need to learn from them along the journey. Danny, what's the most common mistake that entrepreneurs always make that you would advise against? They come to us and they tell us how they're going to sell their company to a very large company for a huge amount of money. And we cut the meeting short and say we're probably not the right partner. If you're thinking from day one, how you're going to make money, selling the asset or the creativity that you're about to embark on and you're in a rush, you're probably not going to build anything of value. At least not with us. Okay, Danny, I like that. Next time we talk about the 30 second elevator pitch that you would like. Danny, remember, they're a partner at index ventures joining us today. Coming up, we get the latest from COP27 in Egypt on the final day of the UN Climate Change Conference. This is Bloomberg. A digital first approach to the future work is where the industry and all companies will be heading. Click the future work not be at home or in the office, but in the metaverse instead. Here's that word, metaverse. Good. Well, how are you doing? When I think about the metaverse, I think about immersive experiences that have a sense of actor presence. Wow, look at this. This is me. The metaverse is projected to become over a trillion dollar market by the end of this decade. And whether you know it or not, you'll probably be working there in the future. We're moving into a world where we're going to be interacting with computers with our bodies. This is definitely trippy. I think the adoption curve is going to be slow. It's weird, a real floaty thing right now. Oh, look at you. You have no legs. It's kind of a fun world and we're just at the very beginning of a very long journey. We will never break, we will never break, build on our foundation strong enough to stay. We will probably be able to move to a slower pace of increases. But we have additional work to do. Nobody covers the fed like Bloomberg. Economics, finance, politics, this is Bloomberg's revenge, early addition, and front scene like what you're in London. It's the final day of COP27 and nations are still no closer to reaching a deal. Let's get out to Bloomberg's Jennifer.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,492,2022-11-18 09:44:24
17879," politics. This is Bloomberg's Rins Early Edition and Fronting Lackwack here in London. It's the final day of COP27 and nations are still no closer to reaching a deal. Let's get out to Bloomberg's Jennifer Zabazaja, who's at the summit in Charmelle Shake. Jen, I mean, I left like 10 days ago and it doesn't seem that they did much progress. Where are we on that? Yeah, Fran, I think that's a fair assessment because on this last day, it still feels like a deal is pretty far off. I mean, we woke up this morning and people were pretty frustrated by the fact that we don't yet have very concrete details about what this final decision is going to look like and you can feel it in the air here. People are waiting to hear a little bit more and the reason is because we haven't really heard much about the key issues that have defined this summit, Fran. I know you know loss and damage, mitigation, adaptation. Those are still left to be determined. We heard from the UN Secretary General and also the COP president yesterday saying that parties are still largely divided on a number of these issues. But as you can see there, what we did hear from the European Union, which could potentially be a breakthrough, is this idea of a loss and damage fund and what we heard from Fran's Timbermans is that this is the final offer. This could potentially be something that developing countries will be pleased to hear. We don't yet know, but the details of what this fund will look like is so key to getting this right. And as you know, it's all about the details when it comes to a summit like COP and getting it right and knowing who is and who isn't included, Fran. So if we don't get a deal or if we don't get an overall overarching deal, are there still positive outcomes from COP at this point? I think, Fran, what a lot of people have said, you know, we were walking around the pavilion, the grounds, and there's a number of exhibitions that countries have had to put up a bunch of their own solutions, climate tech solutions that they've chosen to exhibit here on the grounds. But also when we think about something like methane, when we talk about global warming and keeping the earth under the 1.5 degree Celsius, we did see a number of countries decide to join the global methane pledge, excuse me, and that is very significant by the end of 2030. We might see 150 nations join this. And just yesterday we heard from China not joining that specific deal, but saying that they were going to draft their own pledge, that getting an applause from US Climate Onvoi, John Kerry. So there are some positive signs here, but just a few minutes ago we were hearing a protest that was happening small within the grounds about the lack of still action and definition about what some of these deliverables are going to be for this COP that is supposed to be about Africa and for Africa, and really about implementation and building on what we saw last year in Glasgow. So, Jen, what happens next? Well, we actually just saw France's tournaments running by to go to his next meeting he had met with the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres just here. He was going to his next meeting. It's seeming like it's really down to the wire here. They're trying to get something over the finish line, but it's more it's more likely than not that the talks are going to continue into the weekend just because there is so much that they need to hash out. And there's so much hanging on this cover document that is going to detail a lot of these issues that we mentioned. And that I think is really going to be telling because that's when a lot of the people who are still waiting here to hear about a deal, to hear what the outcome of this COP is going to be like will be able to react and see whether or not we've made any progress whatsoever or whether things are going to get pushed again to another year to next year in Dubai where COP is being held. Jen, thank you so much. Zabazazha, they're a COP27. And of course, it's a great roundup of what's been going in the last two weeks hoping that we still get something as we get into the final mile of the conference. Let's get straight now to the Bloomberg business wash. Here's Laura Wright, Hyderah. Hi, bronzing. The new CEO of FTX has laid out a list of allegations against the company's former leadership slamming them for non-existent oversight and misuse of client funds in a sworn declaration submitted to the bankruptcy court former N Ron and acquitidate.

Executives are optimistic on China easing pandemic restrictions. They will also expand a buyback program. That's the Bloomberg Business Flash Fund scene.

17881," MUSIC Believe you me, this is the same before every World Cup. Go back to 1934 if you want, and when the World Cup was in Italy, it was used as a vehicle to promote fascism for Mussolini. Though it writes on the streets by people in Brazil saying they shouldn't spend all this money on the stadiums, they should spend it on social care. We had Russia who invaded Crimea just a few years before. Sports broadcaster and former England player are Gary Linger comparing some of Qatar's controversies to previous World Cups. Some will take issue to that. You can watch the full interview he gave on Emma Barnett meets on Bloomberg Quick Take. Now, 12 years after being awarded the tournament, Qatar's World Cup is nearly upon us. It's the most expensive World Cup ever, and the world will be watching not just for the action on the field, but for potential unrest around human rights issues. Our Simone Foxman joins us now outside the Al-Bite stadium. The event's been plagued by controversies. How has Qatar responded? Well, it depends on the controversy, right? So one of the controversies has been about worker rights. And Qatar has actually made several important reforms to try and improve at least the baseline standard that workers are living at. For one, they have allowed workers to change jobs more freely. They said the first universal minimum wage in the Gulf, yes, it's only $274 a month, but that's not something that other countries have. However, on, well, activists, I should say, would like them to do more. But this is one issue. There are other issues, right? So there is LGBTQ rights. Right now, that is not something that is considered within Islamic values. And so that's being proud and being out is not permitted. Also, it writes a free expression. Protests aren't normally legal here. We may see that come this weekend or into the next week as these games kick off. The potential that the World Cup could be carbon neutral. That's also something that activists have largely discredited. Yet again, we have to see how this goes because a lot of this we aren't going to know exactly how it's like on the ground until the fans all arrive, which they're doing probably right now. This is, of course, by far, and the way the most expensive World Cup in history. Has it been a good investment for a guitar? You know, it's not just the stadiums, like El Bayt behind me. It's also the massive amounts of development that the country has done to try and accommodate the people that will be here and also to try and make it a modern city. And really, what you see when you drive around, if you were here 10 years ago and you're here now, is a testament to how much they've done. They've built a whole new metro system. They've dramatically expanded an already pretty exceptional airport. They've built a whole new modern port. So by those standards, yes, this has been a success already for Qatar. Will it tolerate a lot of people well? Will logistics be an issue? That remains to be seen. Also, you know, more people know about Qatar. They know where it is on a map now, simply because this event is here. Qatar has been at the center of some geopolitical issues with its neighbors over the past couple of years, and it needs that global knowledge of people who know where it is, who see it as a modern city. And frankly, it doesn't matter if the talk is negative, it's positive. If people know what Qatar is and they can associate this idea of a modern city with it, that will be a success for the Qataris. Thank you so much. Of course, our Simone Foxman, they're on the ground for us in Qatar. Now, Bloomberg surveillance, early edition continues. In the next hour of the focus, firmly on the markets, as we have more Fed speakers throughout the day, early on, we're also hearing from Christina Gard, saying that rates will rise more. They may need to be much more restrictive on economic expansion in order to drive down this inflation that's really rocked more than five times. Let's remember the official target.

It's one of the biggest floating solar plants in the world. Floating solar rays have been gaining traction in Asia, including countries like Singapore and Thailand. Floating projects typically benefit from an easier connection to the power grid. They can also restrict algae blooms while keeping the solar panels cool. This one in particular has healthy local economy. When the power plant was first proposed, residents were given the chance to invest. Some locals were also offered jobs during construction. In fact, it was the community that requested the panels to be shaped as flowers to look more appealing. South Korea relies heavily on imported fossil fuels, but will need to change that to reach its goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2050.

17883," I'm in Hong Kong, our top stories today. Restrictive levels, ECV President Christine Lagarde says interest rates may need to be lifted to levels that restrict economic expansion in order to drive down inflation. Exodus, Elon Musk's ultimate Twitter causes more employees to leave than expected, potentially putting operations at risk. And the end of an era, Nancy Pelosi steps down as the top house Democrats, opening the way for a generational change in party leadership. Welcome to Bloomberg's surveillance early edition. I'm Anna Edwards in London with Matt Miller and Kayleigh Lines in New York. And Kayleigh, surprised to see perhaps quite how much strength we have for European stocks and risk assets here in the European session, given the focus on tighter monetary policy we've seen from policymakers on both sides of the Atlantic. Yeah, especially federal reserve policy makers who keep beating the drum toward potentially a higher terminal rate. The messages we are not done yet, so that whole pivot narrative continually gets called water thrown on it and yet it seems the market has faith each and every time only to get disappointed. Now it's interesting, as Anna pointed out, that you're seeing strength in the European session because actually in the Asian session overnight, the strength faded as we got closer to the close of trading on the day and on the week. The MSCI Asia Pacific indexes a whole up about two to three tenths of a percent, but that is significantly lower than the gains we saw earlier in the session with gains fading for technology stocks as well, including Alibaba, which reported earnings yesterday. It was up as much as 6.7 percent in today, big gain in part due to the buyback program that they announced, but those gains faded into the close only ending the day higher by a little more than 2 percent. In foreign exchange, the Chinese you want a big out performer on the day. Part of that may be after a PBOC official said the country should be targeting growth at least 5 percent next year, so optimism more about the Chinese economy, the offshore you want, trading at 712.72 to the dollar at the moment. And then on that positive Chinese growth story, you've definitely seen that reflected in iron or futures. Up another 1.7 percent overnight. Now in the month of November, up 28 percent Matt were back up to nearly $99 a ton. Remember, we haven't been about 100 since mid-September. All right, so some gains there. Meanwhile, we've seen some losses in crude as the futures curve signals we might be going back into contango real concerns about demand. I'll get to that in a second. First of all, check out S&P futures up about a quarter of a percent. But the last few days we've seen gains in futures only to fade that trade when the market opens. We closed yesterday down again in the cash trade to 39.46, so still a relatively high level down nonetheless. U.S. 10-year yield coming up a little bit, 380.45 as a level right now, so gaining just about four basis points. And we still see some really strong yields across the curve, almost 4.5 percent on the two-year, more than 4 percent still on the five-year, more than 4 percent on the 20 years. That creates real competition with equities in terms of people who are looking for yield. Here's the crude price. Right now it's up a third of 1 percent at $81.89 a barrel. That's for West Texas Intermediate. But it has come down significantly to more than one month lows. Yesterday, we were trading at $81.40 and I think Brent was coming down to about $90.00 as a barrel for the first time since October. Getting back down as we have real concern about demand fading in case of a global recession and all of the central bank, hawkish central bank talk from Christine Lagarde to James Bullard really weighing on sentiment for the commodity. Then Bitcoin, right now, little changed up about 3 of 1 percent. $16,732.81. Bitcoin remains relatively stable at these levels since the crash of FTX. Anna, what do you see in terms of Europe? More on FTX later and the revelations from the guy who dealt with the fallout from N-RON, of course, his view on FTX really interesting. We'll get to that conversation later. This is what Europe looks like. Positive, broadly speaking, making some decent gains actually in some of these markets. Energy names not doing too badly. We have a slight move higher in oil prices, but it's broader than that. Energy stocks going higher. And utility names seem to be doing pretty well here in Europe. Let's roll over and show you some of the other themes. I also picked out oil prices just as massive to show you what's going on there with Brent 8986. I picked it because we're now down below $90 a barrel. So even though the direction of travel this morning is slightly higher, to Matt's point, there seems to be a lot of focus on whether we're heading towards another glass. Some of our colleagues at Bloomberg pointing out the high frequency data on traffic levels in China.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,497,2022-11-18 10:06:10
17884," Lightly higher to Matt's point, there does seem to be a lot of focus on weather we're heading towards another glass. Some of our colleagues at Bloomberg pointing out the high frequency data on traffic levels in China and suggesting maybe recovery despite the headlines is really far away for the Chinese economy given the low level of activity we're still seeing there in some cities. Back to the top of my board we've got the UK 10 year yielding here 3.27% and we did see yields go a little bit higher in yesterday's session. A lot of focus on this asset because of the budget the autumn statement coming through from the UK government it went a little higher. There's a lot of back loading of some of the pain coming through from the UK government but at the same time it was pretty in keeping with what we were seeing in US treasuries as well with bullards comments pushing yields higher and today pretty much in keeping again as those yields ticker little higher with what we're seeing other places in Europe. Central also responding continuing to respond to what we heard from the budget yesterday yesterday we saw stocks in this sector this is energy generation gas gas to the home and that kind of thing this company and others in that space doing well yesterday on the certainty and the clarity that we got around what kind of taxation would be applied what defines windfall taxes crucially and the euro is up by a tenth of a percent and actually we saw quite a lot of volatility early on in the day around the euro a drop back and then a push higher as we listen to what Christine Lagarde the ECB president had to say she's going to be a little bit more careful. She's talking about rates going into restrictive territory perhaps saying there's more to be done on interest rates and talking about the prospects for a session in the euro zone that. All right we're going to focus in on central bankers because key figures from the world of monetary policy and banking are gathered in Frankfurt today for the European banking Congress at the event. As you mentioned ECB president Christine Lagarde said she expects to raise rates further to drive down inflation inflation in the euro area is far too high. It has reached double digits in October for the first time since the start of the monetary union. With inflation likely to remain high for an extended period we need to monitor the evolution of inflation expectations very carefully. Additionally all the recent data on GDP growth have surprised on the upside yes yet the risk of recession has increased. Maria today or European correspondent joins us now from Frankfurt so Maria what were the other highlights that we heard from Lagarde speech. At a conference that you used to cover and and Matt is always interesting to be here of course because you have the central bankers and then you have the bankers to that kind of come together but in that speech two things. The real is stood at one is Christine Lagarde saying despite the fact that there has been better than expected data coming out of the European economy don't be fooled. The idea of a recession is still there and the chances of it actually manifesting have increased and the other thing of course as she repeated the European central bank has a mandate that is to bring back inflation to target and therefore will continue to increase rates. To me it's pretty clear that they will continue to hike in a recession and that is potentially where will be in December when they need for the last time this year. Now that's for the speech of course the question continues to be will it be 50 basis points will be 75 basis points. I think from the speech today is very difficult to really get a sense of which way it's going to fall because she hatched it quite well. She said of course we need to deliver on the mandate continue to hike but at the same time this is data dependent. Now another final thing Matt in about an hour from now we are going to get data from the European central bank on the tail troze. Remember this is a cheap funding by the European central bank. We'll find out whether or not I believe in an hour if banks actually decided to use this window to pay it back. A lot of analysts out there say anything less than 500 billion euros in early repayments today will be a disappointment for the ECB. Alright Bloomberg's Maria today in Frankfurt. Thank you so much. Let's get to tech news now. Twitter has closed its offices until Monday after Elon Musk gave staff an ultimatum to either commit to working long hours at high intensity or to leave and get three months severance. So we're supposed to say many more workers decline to sign musk's pledge than expected and potentially that puts Twitter's operations at risk. Alex we have a Bloomberg quick take joins us now for more so Alex to be honest ice.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,498,2022-11-18 10:10:30
17885," trying to sign musk's pledge then expected. And potentially that puts Twitter's operations at risk. Alex will have a bloomer quick take joins us now for more. So Alex, to be honest, I spent the morning thinking about setting up a professional Instagram account of Twitter's on its way out. Is that realistically what we're looking at? Is Twitter gonna die? I think it's highly unlikely that it dies. It's got a very committed base of users as a hardcore group that continuously posts even despite these problems. The risk is the advertiser. If the advertiser disappear, the revenue dries up. There are a lot of risks associated with, for instance, cutting the moderation staff. Brands don't want their ads to appear next to content that is problematic. But Elon Musk and his investors were spent $44 billion on this company. They will not want it to go under. He does have access to a whole bunch of other capital if he absolutely needs it by selling down his Tesla state, for instance, obviously not what he wants to do if he can help it. So is Twitter gonna die? It would seem unlikely. But there is a huge risk to the company being able to continue operating effectively. It was really interesting to see them have to shut one of their buildings yesterday, because you know all the uncertainty about who was accepting the severance and who was gonna stay. There was a lack of clarity about who really still worked there and therefore who was allowed in, which was quite an interesting development. Here in Europe, it seems that regulators are very keenly watching the level of moderation that is going on over its risk. One EU internal market commissioner saying that he will have to increase staffing levels on that. Yes, we've just seen a whole raft of new legislation introduced at the European level, which categorize certain companies based on how many users they have, revenue, all that sort of thing, as gatekeepers. And if you're one of these companies, you have to not only have more, it's harder to do deals, but there's another piece of it which says you have to, a base of rules when it comes to content. And so Twitter, when it comes to content, is one of those companies. It therefore has obligations it needs to follow legally at a European level. If it doesn't have enough moderators, it will struggle to do so. That's why I think it was Tierra y Breton flagging this this morning has made this point. All right, Alex, thanks very much for joining us. Bloomberg's Alex Webb talking to us about the developments over at Twitter as more and more staff flee. Now let's get to US politics. Nancy Pelosi stepping down as the Democrats leader in the US House of Representatives after holding that role for almost 20 years. And with great confidence in our caucus, I will not seek re-election to democratic leadership in the next Congress. For me, the hours come for a new generation to lead the Democratic caucus that I so deeply respect. Bloomberg's Emory Hortner joins us now for more. So Emory with the octogenarian starting to pass the torch who are the young bucks that are taking over. Yeah, clearly this is going to be a massive shift for the Democratic Party. And it really is a new error of leadership. For many years, actually, they have been pushing for this. But finally, yesterday with Speaker Pelosi saying she will step down from the leadership post. She, of course, will still be in the halls of Congress. She says representing her San Francisco district. All eyes are on Huckim Jeffries. He is, of course, the representative from New York. And he has even been out during the midterms out there with other Democrats making sure people are voting for them to make sure they can try to at least fend off what they successfully did in terms of a red wave. And it does seem like everyone is rallying by him, by him, to take on that leadership position. Also some other names to keep an eye on. Pamela Dryapal from the progressive caucus, as well as Catherine Clark from Massachusetts. These are going to be the big names to watch in this fresh, just generational shift. We should also note, though, for Speaker Pelosi, she did receive praise even begrudgingly from Republicans. One Republican from Oklahoma said, listen, you have to have a lot of respect for her. It's like the admiration of someone that you hate on another team, but you still admire them because they're the best player. So, thank you, Cecil, for the Democrats. Sounds like me with Tom Brady and Marie. So clearly, there's a lot to pay attention to domestically, but geopolitically, as well. We have news overnight that North Korea has fired a suspected intercontinental ballistic missile with an estimated range long enough to reach the American mainland. What has been the response from the US? Yeah, really all eyes continue to be in the Asia Pacific from the United States and you have Kamala Harris.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,499,2022-11-18 10:14:54
17886," It's been the response from the U.S. Yeah, really all eyes continue to be in the Asia Pacific from the United States. And you have Kamala Harris, the Vice President, representing the U.S. at this APEC conference when this happened from North Korea. So she had this in front to meeting with some of the allies like Japan, South Korea, Australia, and they obviously are condemning what went on with North Korea. And also she says the U.S. has an ironclad commitment to their allies in the Asia Pacific. For Japan, this is obviously another level of concern because what the Japanese Prime Minister believes is that this likely landed in Japan's economic exclusion zone, something we haven't seen in the past eight months. What Japan is saying is that these provocations from North Korea are just happening in a more aggressive space. On Sunday, President Biden met on a trilateral level with South Korea and with Japan to discuss this and what we were told before you went into that meeting with Xi Jinping is that he was going to tell Xi, rain in North Korea, or expect a bigger military presence right here in the Asia Pacific. All right, Bloomberg's Ann Marie Horder and still reporting from Bali. Thank you so much. Now let's get back to the markets and take a look at some stocks moving in pre-market trading here in the U.S. And there's some pretty big moves for some of the retailers. Ross, up 16.4% in early hours. Apparently a lot of people are trusting for less because it posted a beat and raised quarter, so getting a nice reward for that stock. And another nice reward for another retailer and that would be gap. They also beat expectations, really shows that they're having more progress managing their inventory. And also they did take a $53 million hit from taking off easy merchant dice due to the whole Kanye or Ye West debacle, but nonetheless that stock is higher by nearly 8% before the bell. And one final, mover to the upside applied materials. This is the biggest maker of chip manufacturing equipment. The fact that supply chains are easing up and making things easier on the supply side is helping offset some of the software demand from the macro environment. So they were able to top expectations better than feared. It is up about 4% before the bell. Okay, so those are some of the pre-market move. It's Kaylee coming up on the program. Cocoa and Guigloa joins us. Head of UK Research at Societase General, but I'll come about the UK. Also get his global perspective on what's happening in markets, the higher rate environment, the question around where terminal rates head to. With Bitcoin may be weathering the gloom, but the FTX saga continues. We have the latest on sandbankment freed and the FTX drama. Plus, the world's fastest growing economy bets it all on oil.

You gotta show up. You gotta be... Charmingly relentless. You have to build emotional endurance. Because there's no straight line of success at the kind of wall over place.

From business's most influential and instrumental. It's knocking it at the bullpen. It's a challenging dynamic. This is a level of uncertainty that we haven't had to deal with. Bloomberg Wall Street Week live tonight with Replays All Weekend on Bloomberg Television and Radio. Welcome back to Bloomberg's surveillance. Early edition, I'm Matt Miller here in New York, a Kayleigh Lines and an Edwards with us out of London. We are hearing more and more about restrictive rates from central banks around the world. Yesterday Jim Bullard laid out a restrictive rate that would be between 5% and 7%. He said using some kind of tailor-like rule. That's even higher than we heard from Jerome Powell at the last Fed meeting. So that's what's concerning markets. In Europe, you're hearing the same kind of thing from Christine Lagarde. Joining us now is Arena Garcia Perez, Bloomberg debt reporter. So Arena, how is this affecting markets? Well, the laggard impact is going to be an increase in the fall rates in the Middle East. The outlook for companies' worsens as it's more expensive, basically, to serve as a debt. Arena, what are we good morning to you? What are we hearing on the opportunities in the corporate debt space at the moment? I spoke to a guest earlier on who was sort of suggesting there might be opportunities in the short term as spreads have been coming down, actually, since we've got that potential peak in inflation in the United States. But then when recession starts to really bite next year, things could get tougher. Yeah, so the tricky part here for investors is to be comfortable with the outlook in terms of... There's a lot of volatility. So being comfortable with the outlook of how companies are going to perform and when is a good moment to get in? That's getting very, very complicated. And as we think about kind of the health of corporate balance sheets, the narrative going into this tightening cycle was we're going to be able to withstand it more so, given how healthy things were. Now that the tightening is still underway, what is it looking like? What default risk are we looking at this cycle? So it's worsen, but the picture is still way better than what we saw, say, in 2009 or even in 2003. So S&P, for instance, is expecting the default rate in the worst case scenario to be around 5.5% in September next year. But that's far from the 8%, 9% that we saw in 2009.

We've invested more than $10 million in our employees over the past year and we're going to continue to invest more. We're testing four-day work weeks to help, you know, especially our working parents kind of juggle that balance between childcare and your work. I know I deal with that all the time. This is really a people-first company. In an inflationary environment, you're going to see us continue to lead with our people. Do you worry at all about a price wage spiral, not just here, but in the industry, in the economy? Yes, and I think that, you know, this is something that, you know, many business leaders are focused on and, you know, time will tell kind of how all of this lands. I think the wage price spiral continues for quite some time. I think we probably have been a lot less aggressive than we can be and many other companies have been. In terms of raising crisis, yes. We've taken our time. If you look at a 20-year history of pricing in this company, we've taken about 2% a year on average. We've never taken what we could. We've always taken what we should. We have to pay people more. We have been and will continue to do so. We'll take a little bit of a margin compression on that as we've had to and I think that's the right thing. That for the long term, ShakeChat continues to be what we're building, which is the next generation's burger joint. The multi-trillion dollar industry. There's a lot of ground to cover. Come on, these got absolutely crushed. I'm sure you once happening in ETFs like no one else, Bloomberg ETF RQ Monday on Bloomberg. Every Friday with 30 minutes dedicated to fixed income, I'm Jonathan Farrow this. Here's Bloomberg real yield. This is Bloomberg's valence early edition. Here's what you need to know. Restrictive levels. ECB President Christine Lagarde says interest rates may need to be lifted to levels that restrict economic expansion in order to drive down inflation. Exodus. Elon Musk's ultimate Twitter causes more employees to leave than expected, potentially putting operations at risk. And the end of an era. Nancy Pelosi steps down as the top house Democrat opening the way for a generational change in party leadership. I'm Anna Edwards in London with Matt Miller and Kayley Lines in New York and Matt European equity markets. Perhaps surprisingly, buoyant today for this Friday given the level of kind of hawkishness that we've heard from, yes, over at the Fed, Jim Bullard, but also from Christine Lagarde. A lot of talk about restrictive levels. Yeah, absolutely. Although this is nothing new, I mean, anyone who's been paying attention to Fed speakers and to the situation in the UK and Europe knows that something drastic has to be done. And they continue to pledge, they'll do it. Take a look at US futures. We are up on the day after Bullard said restrictive rates need to be between 5 and 7%. Now, I guess that could surprise you, but people were talking about the 6% terminal rate.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,503,2022-11-18 10:32:14
17890," After a bowler said restrictive rates need to be between 5 and 7%. Now, I guess that could surprise you, but people were talking about the 6% terminal rate at the last Fed meeting. So it just seems like investors, equity investors at least have a very short memory and continue to think that a pause or a pivot is coming even as often as Fed speakers tell us it's not. The US 10 year yield rising, three basis points right now, 379 52. So maybe all of this here is priced in 9x crude right now up about a quarter of a percent, but it had come down yesterday to the lowest level that we've seen. And about six weeks Brent as well on concern that these restrictive rates are going to cause a recession and fewer people are going to buy gasoline. It's about the demand side problem, not about the supply side for oil. And then Bitcoin, it's up 8, 10s, 9, 10s of a percent. Getting back up towards 17,000, but really it's been hovering with the 16 handle all week and basically since the collapse of FTX. Haley, what do you see in the pre market? Well, there are a lot of earnings winners in early hours trading today. Some of them remaining retailers, which of course has been a very mixed bag throughout the week, but it was definitely a positive story for Ross, which posted a beat and raised quarter boosting its outlook on sales momentum. Of course, it's a discount retailer. So maybe a lot of people are looking to steal some deals in this kind of macro environment. That stock is up 16.4 percent in gap, which also managed to top expectations is higher by about 8 percent as it has a better job managing its inventory. Palo Alto Networks, which is a cybersecurity company, also managed to top expectations analysts really saying that they are working through the difficult macro environment. It's up about eight and a half percent has a beat on really all of its metrics. And finally, apply materials. This is the biggest chip manufacturer maker of that equipment. It is up 4 percent. Yes, it's dealing with the softer macro picture as well, but the fact that supply chains are using helping out that company in pre market trading in it. Hey, Lee, European equity markets, then a lot of your pre market movements that cause a simple European stocks are really positive, perhaps surprisingly so. By more than 1 percent this morning on not very clear drivers, we've had some hawkishness from Jim Bullard hawkishness from Christine Lagarde at the ECB president there. But still European stocks move higher. A lot of sectors in positive territory, utilities, energy stocks moving higher. The UK 10 year yield in focus, Gilt markets broadly in focus in the aftermath of that autumn statement yesterday, clearly going down much more calmly with markets than did the so-called mini budget, which was entirely the intention of the government, I'm sure. 3.26 percent the yield on the 10 years. So we do see that yield ticking up a little and it did do yesterday, but that was in keeping with what we'd seen in more global trends as well. Centrica is up by 2 percent this morning. Yesterday we saw this sector, so this is energy businesses, companies that provide energy to the home and beyond. They were doing actually pretty well yesterday. We got some certainty in that autumn statement from the chancellor about what defines excess profits and therefore what the windfall tax was going to look like. And in amongst that certainty we saw this company and others in the sector moving higher. The euro is pretty flat today, but it's been really quite volatile. 1.366 is now where we trade. Been quite volatile as we've listened to Christine Lagarde at the ECB talking about the level of restricted territory that's needed and the risk of recession, Kaylee. Yeah, Anna, so interesting to see policymakers really across the world talking about race that need to go even higher. You mentioned Jim Bullard saying that terminal rate of 5 to 7 percent could be appropriate and certainly that would mean the market may have more work to do. Let's continue this conversation with Cocoa, Abu Bloa, global head of economics, quant and cross asset research at Sok Gen. So Cocoa, clearly you know a lot of things as we talk about what we've heard from central bankers this week where the market expectations of how high rates ultimately go are versus what they're saying. Are we appropriately priced? I think the market is expecting a cut in June of next year until sort of the middle of 2024. If you look at US swap markets and we think that it is not appropriately priced, our view is that the fight against inflation is not over and to quote Winston Churchill who famously said after the defeat of the Nazis at the Battle of El Al-Alamine in November of 1942 that this is not the end. It's not even the beginning of the end but possibly the end of the beginning. And in our view the peak of inflation will look more like...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,504,2022-11-18 10:36:36
17891," 1942 that this is not the end. It's not even the beginning of the end, but possibly the end of the beginning. And in our view, the peak of inflation will look more like an inverted view as opposed to an inverted V. If you take the analogy of what we were discussing in terms of U-shaped B-shaped recovery in 2020. So it means that you need, there's a couple more hikes and then we'll have to we'll see a plateau because you need a lot more sort of restrictive monetary policy to bring inflation down from the 6% back to the 23%. And that will need a lot more tightening and demand destruction. Okay, so an inverted U is what the inflation picture looks like then in your eyes. Cocoa, good morning. Nice to see you. But at what level does that U sort of plateau? Yesterday we heard, as Kayleigh was saying from Jim Bullard and he was talking about five to five and a quarter. But they were parts of his presentation that seemed to nod towards the idea that things could go much higher. I mean, it's seven even featured on some of the charts. He was dealing with what are your expectations of the terminal rate? Yeah, and this is an interesting point because we did some some calculation. If you take the Taylor rule and you use unemployment or sort of GDP as an input, you would actually get five between five and seven percent for the neutral rate. And therefore our view is that it will, but you should plateau between five and six percent roughly speaking. But it will clearly depend obviously on how sticky the inflation market is or the core inflation is in terms of rent and wages etc. But it is also very important to realize that it takes three to five quarters for interest rates height, interest rate height to have an effect on the economy. So by the time we reach age two of next year, we will have had a cumulative effect of over 500 basis point of tightening. And this is only then that we'll see whether it's it's has been enough or not. And ultimately our base case scenario is, yes, let's say between five and six percent and then the federal pause and then we'll have to cut as the US economy enters a shallary session. How do you expect earnings? Wait, wait, a shallary session. How do you differentiate between a shallary session or a deeper session? What makes the difference there in terms of what we're doing now for next year? Yeah, I mean the difference will be two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth in the sort of mid a few 10s of a percent as opposed to what we all see in the UK for example, where we expect the negative 1.4% GDP growth in real terms for next year. And I think this is sort of the difference because you also have a lot of automatic stabilizers, you know, cumulative exact savings of close to $2.5 trillion, corporate balance sheets being a fairly resilient compared to where they were in 2008 for example. And then government as well, injecting some fiscal stimulus plus the green deal or the energy transition investments that are all offsetting some of that technique. Well, Coco, you mentioned the new GDP forecast of a contraction of 1.4% next year. How much downside risk is there to that? And in the years that follow based off the autumn statement that Jeremy Hunt gave yesterday. Yeah, so I think we did regard to so it will clearly depend on obviously on the market market and the marginal capacity to spend which will clearly hit the middle income in the UK as we saw. So I think they essentially could be some downside, but I think that the budget has been fairly balanced with some investment and growth programs as well to avoid protracted depression so to speak. But I do think that if you take a step back and you see what's been priced already in terms of the weakness of the sterling and China that could potentially come out of its net zero or zero COVID policy, you could see a sort of stabilization of global growth and that could potentially help the UK recovery that regard. Can I take a summer slightly different, Coco? And that is in the aftermath of the collapse of FTX, some of the revelations coming out about the business itself, maybe around the sector, really fascinating and quite shocking in some cases. How have you been thinking about your expectations for either crypto or for blockchain technologies crucially as we move through this period of volatility for the asset class? Well, I think banks in general have looked at the decrease.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,505,2022-11-18 10:40:51
17892," chain technologies crucially as we move through this period of volatility for the asset class. Well I think banks in general have looked at the crypto in terms of its technology of blockchain and how it could be applied to the sort of value chain in the banking system. I think most banks have sort of if you look at it from the regulator have sort of stayed away to some extent but they've been somewhat done on CBDC so central bank digital currencies. But the asset class has clearly sort of expanded in terms of the financial derivative markets you know you start to have futures and different derivatives on that. But the high volatility is something that requires more regulation and I think this is probably going to occur over the next few months after the FTX debacle. Thank you so much. Thanks for joining us. Cocoa Blower of Societé General. Thank you very much. Coming up we hope to dive into some of the detail around FTX. The fallout continues. We'll bring you the latest on San Bankman freed and the contagion that's followed this is linked. You did not get stronger that moment that you're lifting the barbell. You get stronger as your body is making repairs, making recovery. Recovery is a win and how you get fitter faster stronger. Recovery technology includes everything from massage guns and foam rollers to compression boots, hyperbaric chambers, cryo chambers, infrared sonnas and even infrared pajamas. And athletes are partnering to become investors to take those products mainstream. When you look at tech and sports right now it's completely innovating the way training's going completely changing the way recovery's going. I think sky's the limit as far as where it can go. But while some of these products can feel amazing it can be difficult to differentiate between what really helps the body and what just tricks the mind. Every time you're chasing the latest greatest newest tool you're probably chasing a maraud. The top names in climate change are on Bloomberg. Building out local wind, local solar, hydrogen these are solutions to not just climate issues but geopolitical issues. We are in a position by 2030 to 80% of all electricity generated by wind. The renewables are the safest, the cleanest and the cheapest form of energy today especially for countries such as Greece. Nobody covers climate change like Bloomberg. Your global business authority. This is Bloomberg's surveillance early edition. I'm Kayley Lines with Matt Miller in New York and Anna Egwars in London. Now a look at what is coming up today. The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit continues. President Xi Jinping and Kamala Harris are among leaders set to attend the event. We'll be getting some US economic data including existing home sales. Plus more Fed speed, Boston Fed President Susan Collins will be speaking at 8.30am New York time. And then over the weekend the 2022 World Cup kicks off on Sunday bringing billions of viewers and millions of fans to the tiny Gulf state of Qatar. And on that note, Qatar and FIFA have promised that the 2022 World Cup will be carbon neutral. As the tournament begins though environmentalists are raising alarms saying the event has been green-washed. In 2010 FIFA announced that Qatar would host the 2022 World Cup. In its bid the country promised to make it a carbon neutral tournament.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,506,2022-11-18 10:45:10
17893," In 2010, FIFA announced that Qatar would host the 2022 World Cup. In its bid, the country promised to make it a carbon neutral tournament. But as the matches approach, environmentalists are claiming that Qatar has greenwash the world cup and that the event will put millions of megatons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. So that claim is mostly a PR play. Essentially, there is no way that a mega event of that size can be carbon neutral. FIFA can do better and should do better. And my focus would be on encouraging to do that for the next World Cup. The UN defines carbon neutrality or achieving net zero carbon emissions as balancing a measured amount of carbon released with an equal amount offset. First step is to measure your emissions. And so that's what FIFA has done for the World Cup. We looked into that calculation and we think that this is quite significant on the estimated. So there's two big challenges with any carbon neutrality claim at an event of this size. The first one is travel. And the second part of this is construction. 75% of the carbon footprint of all sports stadium over their entire lifetime is locked in on day one from the materials that they've built from. It's not about operating costs. It's about concrete steel. Qatar has invested billions of dollars in infrastructure for the tournament, including building seven new stadiums. The researchers estimate that the World Cup will emit 3.6 megatons of carbon dioxide. The construction of the stadium is the most problematic elements because it's the element that we think was most massively underestimated. From that factor, we think the total footprint would be five million tons. International flights in and out of Doha will account for the majority of emissions. However, organizers argue that this World Cup will be more energy efficient than others since fans won't have to fly to different venues and can instead just take public transit. The sticking point is always the flights. Most Olympics and World Cups, it accounts to more than 85% of total emissions. Balancing carbon emissions with offsets is key to carbon neutrality. So far, Qatar has purchased less than 350,000 carbon offset credits of the 3.6 million needed in their estimation. The Supreme Committee says that it has already secured a minimum of 1.5 million credits from the Global Carbon Council and that further details will be forthcoming. So far, greenwashing issues are not keeping fans from rooting for their teams on the pitch. An estimated 1.7 million people will be in attendance with over 3 million tickets sold. But with a warmer future ahead, effects on fans will soon be felt. So, the most important sport is the most enormous opportunity to tackle the climate crisis because we can engage football fans and make them advance of the environment through their favourite sport. Bumbe, Simone Polkzmann reporting there and Simone joins us now from outside the Al-Bates stadium. Simone, very good to have you with us on the programme. That package they're dealing with the green element. There's been some criticism on various fronts ahead of this World Cup. One of them around the green issues, as we heard there, also around construction and the conditions for migrant workers. There has been so much construction. I was in the country about 10 years ago and then a lot of the places where games are going to be hosted didn't even exist. Is this considered a worthy investment? Are Qataris pleased with what they have produced here? I think they absolutely are. I think what they say is that showing that a small country with a population of just 3 million people can actually carry out of an event of the scale, build all the construction, all the new roads, all the new metro system that are necessary to kind of keep fans happy and get them from place to place. That alone in itself says to their world partners that they can do stuff and that they can be relied upon to even when the going is tough. The going has been tough for them. In addition to the development goals that were part of hosting the event here, note that just five years ago, Qataris neighbors, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Bahrain, as well as Egypt cut off abruptly, trade, diplomatic and travel ties leaving Qatar essentially out on its own. Although they have come back into the fold, it's important for Qatar to have people know.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,507,2022-11-18 10:49:31
17894," diplomatic and travel ties leaving Qatar essentially out on its own. Although they have come back into the fold. It's important for Qatar to have people know what they are, who they are, where they are, in protecting their sovereignty, frankly, going forward. What about the fans? I mean, this kicks off on Sunday, right? I guess people have spent thousands and thousands of dollars on tickets, not even including airfare. Under the assumption that beer would be sold, right? They agreed to sell and heiser bush or allow an heiser bush to sell beer. And now we're here and that they may reverse that decision. Is that true? Yeah, just in the last hour or so, we learned that no longer would actual alcoholic beverages, specifically beer be sold inside the perimeter of the stadium. Now, it was already going to be curtailed. You were only going to be able to buy it outside the stands themselves and in the hospitality suite. And for outside the stands themselves, we're only going to have the windows three hours before the start of the match and then one hour after the match to be able to purchase bud light. But now it looks like there's going to be no beer in the stadium at all. That's a famous way. Except for those hospitality, those high-end clients that are sitting in the key seats. Yeah, exactly. You know, look, this is not a place where alcohol is completely banned. You're going to be able to go to hotels and restaurants attached to them and still be able to purchase alcohol at a price, mind you. It is very expensive. It's $12 for a pint of beer, pretty much at minimum. You know, that said, I think that the goal that the goalposts have changed this late in the game. Remember back in August, we saw the date of the opening match shift today earlier. It just kind of makes you wonder how much is still shifting in the organizers' head. It's where like 48 hours out from the opening ceremony. All right, Bloomberg Simone Foxman reporting from outside of stadium in Cutter. Thank you so very much. And again, the World Cup begins on Sunday. This is Bloomberg. When I started, I had no idea it was going to turn into this, just a tricycle empire. I don't have any investor. All this is all money in. This is me going out in Hustland, bringing that money back and just building it, building it, building it. Yeah, I think about a person that was homeless at one point. Didn't really have any money coming in. The fact that this person was relentless and just determined to succeed and not let rock bottom define him as an individual. I can take things and put them together and take them apart and make them better and put them back together. I respect the craft. So I don't want to minimize and disrespect the value of each step of the craft and do by machine what should be done by hand.

When US jobs numbers are released, Bloomberg brings you crucial data at terminal speed and instant expert analysis. Nobody covers jobs day like Bloomberg. FTX was very centralized. It was all centered around this one guy. And when you centralize anything, bad things can happen. That was a chairman of DFJ, Tim Draper, speaking with Bloomberg, on the collapse of FTX. The new CEO of FTX has laid out a list of allegations against the company's former leadership, slamming them for non-existent oversight and misuse of client funds. Anna Irera, Bloomberg senior crypto editor joins us now for more. It's pretty damning this testimony in a sense of the new CEO, because he's overlooked horrendous bankruptcies and scandals like NROM. Exactly. He didn't hold back at all. He painted a picture of a company, basically, complete chaos, where no one really had any control on anything. They can't really figure out how many employees even worked for FTX. They don't have any control of where the cash is. They're trying to figure out how to manage the bankruptcy. So, you know, it keeps getting crazier the more and more we actually get into it. And here what was going on, they talked about loans from one of the companies to some of the main players as well, some of the executives, including some backman freed. So it's just quite jaw-dropping. So Anna, are there any shoes left to drop or dominoes left to fall? I mean, yes, I guess we will still know. They alluded that some of the things that have come out of media reports are exactly sort of what happened with customer funds. And also, you know, there is no clear picture of how many liabilities is there to have with customers. And, you know, where the money went. So we're still waiting here about that. And obviously, who the bigger creditors are. There's still so much that has to come out. It's amazing, isn't it? The revelations coming through from this kind of reporting about the way that the business was run, as you say, the things they don't know about employees and where the cash is. The new CEO also is suggesting that investors should not obviously rely on audits that have previously been done. I suppose this just raises questions for other businesses in the sector or elsewhere. You know, raises questions once again about what public information is available and how much you can rely on it. Yeah, so in crypto generally, there's a lot of talk of transparency, but for exchanges, there isn't that much of information available. And in some cases, even the audits aren't that reliable. You know, they said, do not trust the audits here. And that's because there is no separation of powers. And so you might have, you know, the exchange being the custodian and being the trade repository, the central clearing counterparty. So it's all kind of mixed up. And obviously when you mix up roles, you have conflicts of interest potentially. And when you don't write anything down, except for in your slack chats. It's pretty difficult to be honest. With emojis. Yeah, with emojis. Anna, thanks so much for joining us. Anna, Anna, Anna, Anna, covering crypto for us out of London.

17896," Manager So you build a successful company but you might not be able to do it. So you build a successful company but you might not want to run it for the next 10, 15, 20 years or do you and if you didn't, would you want to go into government? If the president called you to serve our country, would you go into government? Or would you start another company? I love what I do and I feel like I have this luxury with 23 me that it keeps evolving. We started out just as a start out of consumer company. For thick and research, we got into drug discovery in 2015 and now we're getting to the delivery of care. So I've been really lucky with 23 me that it's been endlessly interesting and I'm surrounded by incredibly talented, brilliant individuals where I learn from them. And what I always advise people to do is you should take jobs where you're learning and if you stop learning in a job then you should quit. And frankly when people leave 23 me, I say if you're not learning anymore you should move on. So I'm 100% committed to 23 me. That said, my other passion is other direct to consumer. I want to build out a true consumer empowered healthcare world, one that is outside of the existing system and I do there's no greater force than government. Inflation both here and globally is a problem and central banks have created or at least made the problem worse. The end of the inflation problem is probably in sort. I think the market is trying to find its footing. The market is getting poised for a breakout even more inverted from here. The market's strengths has brought with it looser financial conditions which is not what the Fed wants. This is Bloomberg surveillance with Tom Keane, Jonathan Farrow and Lisa Abramowitz. Good morning everyone, Jonathan Farrow, Lisa Ramon since I'm Keane on a Friday on Radio on television. We welcome all of you. I'm out on Twitter. I've just been tweeting your moments ago, Lisa and maybe I'll get one more tweet in. That's a kind of morning. We're having turmoil, basically an exodus from Twitter after he said they're ready to go hardcore and press this button if you want to be in. No one really impressed that button evidently and so now he doesn't seem to have a staff and people are worried. For those of you that went to bed early last night, social media with all that's going on in Bitcoin and we've got so much to talk about on a Friday to prepare for the weekend to get into the holiday season to look at equity's bonds, currencies, commodities, about 1130 last night, something original happened. There's nothing else to say. Basically full scale revolt by an entire staff of a company and how much are you looking at something that is idiosyncratic to an Elon Musk world to something that is a Twitter world and a private company that once was public and how much is this really this question mark around social media platforms right now because there is a story.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,510,2022-11-18 11:02:31
17897, on Musk World to something that is a Twitter world and a private company that once was public. And how much is this really this question mark around social media platforms right now because there was a story in the Wall Street Journal also this morning that met a laid off a number of staff were taking bribes to overcome to interfere with certain accounts. My point is this really shows how much of a complete seashift there is in companies once very highly valued. Now it's going to be interesting to see and we're going to be of course covering this through the day Katie Greiffelt I've really scheduled on the crypto uproar somewhere through the morning as well and we're thrilled I hope to bring you Mendy Pseung of Bloomberg Intelligence who's in cyclopedic on what goes on behind the walls of the Silicon Valley companies. This is a moving story and Bloomberg will be covering it through the morning. I think we've also got a look at further curve inversion to me the bond dynamics Lisa continue and that's been the story of the week. And it hinges on all of the speak that we've been hearing from the Federal Reserve at out Christine Lagarde who earlier this morning European hours said that perhaps they need to lift rates even further and talked about how even the risk of recession isn't sufficient to really stop them from continuing raise rates. Did she go half bull or no full bull or exactly just say five to seven percent that seven percent. That stopped the markets yesterday. That did stop the markets and I was speaking yesterday with Tom Kennedy of JPMorgan Private Bank and I said to him is this realistic he used to work at the New York Fed. He said yes it is realistic and I said to him what probability would you assign a seven percent rate. He's at 15 percent. That's not nothing. It's small but it's not nothing. John Ferrell still out on assignment. I got to have been John has been looking for the inflation report we get before the next Fed meeting. But I would say with the rapidities through the week of layoffs including in Amazon and others everybody's got their own story here all of a sudden the jobs report first week of December has a new weight to it. Will it be bad enough? And that sounds really perfect. I actually thought my little brain thought of that this morning is putting out my last tweet. But this is unfortunate. You don't want to be saying this. This is a perverse thought. Will it be bad enough to be a good thing for the market and a good thing for the Fed Reserve. People want to see softening. But I want to like we talk about the layoffs that we've seen Morgan Stanley yesterday. The team putting out this and I thought it was interesting layoffs in the tech sector are making headlines but it's just a small part of the overall story and this is really in the end with other people who are saying they expect firms to hold onto workers through the growth slowdown and tech is a specific area that is not. Here's that line for you on radio on TV. It's not a quiet Friday. We're going to do that with the data here up 25 a little lift to the market. Really don't know what to make about it other than maybe Fed hope is how I'd put it. A story worth looking at. I'm going to send schedule to be with us here on oil now again under $90. Brent crude the global price 8924 West Texas intermediate 81 33 maybe this is the growth in this fear out there including a reaffirmation of China slogging along as well 10 year yields 3.79 percent two year yield remember 5 percent anticipating that's the last time Farrow had it was working. We were talking about getting out to 5 percent 4.48 percent on the two year yield dollar with some weakness. I need to be briefed while I look at the Twitter to see if it's still working. Okay. Well you check out your world cup bracket and Twitter to see whether it's still working. I'm looking at central bank speak. Okay. It includes a Bundesbank president Joachim Nagle ECB's class not at 815 and Bank of England's Catherine man at 815 they're speaking over at the management. We can't. Exactly. I would agree with that because how do you dovetail a weakening economy and the need to be hawkish and to fight inflation. Then we hear from the Boston Fed president Susan Collins at 830 a.m. As far as US data not that loud on the front but you know this to me is going to be interesting. Ten and we get US existing home sales. And how much do we see that ongoing weakness on Tuesday in the US we saw a read for the home builder sentiment the NHP data of information coming in at the weakest when you take out the pandemic the weakest reading in more than a decade just to give you a sense of where I'm radio this chart that Lisa put up is absolutely perfect and a radio all you need to do and we all know this coast to coast plunge is the only word that works here and that really confirms what we're seeing in other indicators as well and Sunday of course we'll be hearing about the world cup which begins in Doha is it this Sunday I didn't know that I'm trying to read good morning to the athletic doing a great job. Yeah I would agree it's the most expensive one ever 300 billy.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,511,2022-11-18 11:06:54
17898," Is it this Sunday? I didn't know that. I'm trying to read. I'm trying to read. Good morning to the athletic doing a great job. Yeah, I would agree. I'm trying to read on it. It's the most expensive one ever. $300 billion. Yeah, but the breaking news is they're taking alcohol out of it. They have a, they have a, you talk about the business of this. I guess they have an agreement with Anheuser Bush of St. Louis. And they're taking Budweiser out of the stadium and it's going non-alcoholic. And if you're, you know, a fight and buffalo from Boulder, you know, that the only thing non-alcoholic is what's called course three to beer. I can say is that would be the breaking news by you, Tom. You're like, the breaking news is not how much they spend. It's not that they're starting the world cup. They're not going to allow alcohol. I want John to go to London with this seriously wonderful knowledge. And I'm going to go to the sink and Boulder, Colorado and have course three, two and watch every moment of every game. You and me glued to this is where we will be right now. We are glued to get you started strong and we do this with Christian Altinge, global chief investment officer Deutsche Bank, private bank with a real holistic view of where we are and how to recalibrate. Christian, how do you recalibrate in the 2023? Yeah, first of all, I think you mentioned inflation already. That will be a main and very, very important topic. And what we see is I think inflation will come down. So we probably have seen the peak in the US. We will soon hopefully see the peak in Europe. So there's a bit more to come. And then what's the center of like reaction function? I think that will still be the main topic. And from our point of view, I think we have to be a bit careful. We are not in the camp that the Fed is cutting next year. If you look at the experience in the 70s and 80s, maybe they just wait. And I would be surprised to see the ECB cutting and we even thinking maybe they go higher than the price 3%. You have the advantage at the Deutsche Bank shop of David Fulker's Landau, Alan Roscon, Sarah Velosson, the team there. And they always have a depth of history to them. Is there any indication by your shop that this idea of a pivot in 2023 is historically based? Is it a fantasy? Is it a guessing game? Or is there real history that it can happen? It looked first of all, I would always say past performance. And you know the continuation of this, right? And I think this kind of inflation is a bit different because it's coming much more from the supply side and not so much from the demand side. And from that perspective, I would not really look into the past to draw some massive conclusions out of this. What we can see from the models is that we think inflation is sticky, that we are not going very fast back to old levels. And I think that's what central banks have to see as well. And rather be cautious in too cut too early. I really don't want to say this. I actually hate saying this word. But does it feel like the pivot is more believed in in Europe than in the US right now? Not to sure, I would say. So I think there's at least some discussion. And if you look at market pricing, that the Fed is slower, it's going to be slower in hiking. And that's not a pivot for my point of view. But we are not in the camp that really the Fed is cutting. On the ECB here in Europe, I would say the market is not seeing a cut nor do we. We would rather say maybe the ECB needs to do even a bit more if you look at inflation levels. If you look at the composition of inflation, it's different from the US. So we talked about Jim Bullard earlier this morning, St. Louis Fed president, who put out the number of 7 percent as a potential worst case scenario for Fed funds rates. He then went on to say, actually, he sees inflation coming down quite rapidly. If the US were to experience that kind of disinflation, how much would that relieve the pressure from the rest of the world? How much of the evilation is being driven by the spending in the US that you're seeing from the consumer? So look, I would say, of course, the market is looking what the Fed has been doing. And other central banks, again, in this hiking cycle, have been following maybe a bit later. But I would say, again, if you look at the composition of inflation, it's, as I said, different in the US. Very strong labor market, not so much an energy issue, energy price issue as we have to here in Europe. So from that perspective, I would say central banks probably are differentiating a little bit and not just following the Fed around the globe. But of course, it's helpful and all the discussion about hyperinflation and the Fed being super high is then going away a little bit. So that should help in general markets. But central banks have to still act on their, say, whole local inflation. So any questions?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,512,2022-11-18 11:11:21
17899," the fact being super high is then going away a little bit. So that should help in general markets. But center banks have to still act on their say whole local inflation. Christian, you and I have textbooks that say 6040 is an intelligent way to go. That's been blown up. What happens here? Does 6040 reaffirm itself 60% equities 30% bonds 10% cash whatever does it reaffirm itself out next three years. If you look through, right, I think this year 2022, you've seen that massive drop in bonds and drop in equities, which is really rare. If you look back to history, it's it's the last time you saw something like this 1800 something 1788 actually whether you can trust the data is another question. Well, I was there. You can trust the data. I lived it. This is worse. Continue. So and if you look through, right, I think from the fixed income side, if we all could agree on lower growth, we even think there's recession. But at least if there's lower growth, that should not be too bad for the bond side. And secondly, on the equity side, if I look towards the end of the year, say the 12 months, right, right. I'm not too sure. It's so bad on the equities actually. So I think for 6040 is not the worst year for 2023 actually. Germanic optimism. Is he will have for the world cup as well? Christian, old thing. Thank you so much. Global Chief Investment Officer at Deutsche Bank. Thrill to heaven. On today, we've got so much to talk about. I've got to talk to Bramow about the wheelhouse and that is what we did. We see this week in this corporate spread market out to high yield that off this curve in version. If you're waking up curve in version negative 69 basis points. That's Greek to me and you for global Wall Street. That's a wow statistic. Stay with us through this Friday. This is Bloomberg's surveillance. Keeping you up today with news from around the world with the first word. I'm Lisa Mateo. Ukrainian forces continue to fend off Russian assaults in the east. Kiev is enduring long periods without power following multiple attacks on critical energy infrastructure across the country. Meanwhile, Pope Francis said in an interview, the Vatican is available to do quote everything possible to mediate. President Vladimir Zelensky maintains that only the return of territory taken by Russia will allow an end to the war. A Swedish investigation into ruptures at the Nord Stream one and two gas pipelines finds a cause is quote grievous sabotage. The investigation will continue analyzing the sections where the damage occurred. An explosive residue was found. Now that pipeline which crosses the Baltic Sea to Germany from Russia is a focus of a pro by authorities in Sweden after two weeks were discovered. Metas fired or disciplined more than two dozen employees and contractors in the past year for improperly taking over user accounts sometimes allegedly for bribes. That's according to the Wall Street Journal and that report says some workers are accused of accepting thousands of dollars in return for giving hackers access to user accounts. A metas spokesman told the journal that the company will continue taking appropriate action against people that sell fraudulent services and target its platforms. Katari officials are set to ban the sale of alcohol within the world cup stadiums. That move is a dramatic reversal of an earlier decision to allow Anheuser Bush to sell Budweiser beer. Bloomberg learned it will likely result in moving concession stand serving alcohol further away from the stadiums. The tournament kicks off Sunday with the hosts taking on Ecuador.

17900," a I'm going to name a couple of your babies. I don't know if I'm asking you to choose amongst your children, but you know, some of the most recognizable buildings by you, of course, the Millennium Bridge, London City Hall, the Reichstag and the Great Court British Museum. What was your favourite project to do? The Reichstag does stand out because, first of all, it's an energy manifesto. So it transforms something that was dependent on fossil fuels, it uses all the technology to produce something which is essentially carbon neutral and there's a public building that's a statement. It's a symbol of a city, it's a symbol of a nation, it incorporates works of art, it's recycling and existing building which, as I mentioned earlier, is the ultimate in sustainability. If you can give a new life to a building, it also creates public space at the roof level. It's the most visited parliament in the world, so it puts. The public above the politicians who are answerable to them and that, of course, was made possible by the politicians. So it's a demonstration of democracy in action. Welcome to the world of decentralized finance. I'm going to take a look right here at regulation. We are seeing digital currencies under some pressure.

How does that affect disruptors like you? What happens to everything that you're investing is when the last Bitcoin is mine. Bloomberg crypto Tuesdays. Lots happening on Wall Street. I think, Jay Powell said things that were indefensible. Need to catch up. This is Bloomberg Wall Street week. I'm David Weston. We've got the information and insights. We think that's the next secular shift from businesses most influential and instrumental. It's knocking it at the bull. It's a challenging dynamic. This is a level of uncertainty that we've had to deal with. Bloomberg Wall Street week live tonight with Replays All Weekend on Bloomberg Television and Radio. We're in the early stages of a sustainability revolution that has the magnitude of the industrial revolution coupled with the speed of the digital revolution. Nobody covers climate change like Bloomberg, your global business authority. The top names at the Fed are on Bloomberg. I think it will probably be appropriate soon to move to a slower pace of increases. But we have additional work to do. It recovers the Fed like Bloomberg. Ultimately, we will raise rates to levels that bring inflation back down to our medium term target in a timely manner. As I explained recently, how far we need to go, how fast we'll be determined by the inflation outlook. We're not putting a date on it. Maybe we'll see that Lisa here coming up. It's certain ECB press conferences. But this is not moved markets, but got the attention of all.

17901," ECB press conferences, but this uh not moved markets but got the attention of all Christian Lagarde speaking Maria today was there we're gonna go to that in a moment and Lisa on a Friday it's a reaffirmation by Lagarde of this linkage of economic slowdown to bringing inflation down. You nailed it when you said the markets aren't really moving on this they're done with this they've heard this before. It's all very sort of like okay yeah we know and we're gonna go where we think we go we don't really believe your trajectory we're gonna go with ours. We're gonna frame out here. I'm Marie Horton where this in Indonesia working our way back to America we'll talk of Speaker Pelosi here in the next hour. Maria today oh in Frankfurt is well Maria uh Lisa wants to go to the Lagarde story and what you're visiting at. I want to go to the fact winter is here. I looked at the weather report in Ukraine and Maria this is not funny for the next four days starting Saturday it's 23, 24, 25 degree lows. How does this war change that winter is here? Look at winter and not just in in Ukraine and in fact Tom I love that you mentioned that because we're about to see the big the first big cold spell in Europe two temperatures are gonna go minus in a country like Germany so that again we get the winter factor that now fully place in also particularly in Ukraine it's pretty obvious now that well the Russians realized on the battlefield it's complicated to push back the Ukrainians have been pretty good actually indeed doing the opposite the counteroffensive has worked in the favor of Ukraine so Russia now targets the infrastructure that means Ukrainians could freeze this winter we heard from the electricity operator yesterday that says 40 percent of the grid has been damaged already that's why you see this missile strikes happening across the country this is now a cold war in the sense that the temperature now is a factor that Vladimir Putin wants to really use and inflict maximum pain not just in Ukraine but also here remember temperatures are going to drop for the first time this weekend. Maria dovetail this into the Central Banking conference we are at where all of the world's or European central bankers come together and try to figure out a path forward how much are they winter dependent how much are they Ukraine dependent how much they talk about the exogenous factors and other effects how restrictive they have to go how much they have to hike rates. Yes and look this is this is a good conference because you have the the central bankers but also the bankers here the Deutsche Bank CEO is right there and I believe in fact he was a China with the Christian Lagarde at the the break but she did talk about this she talked about the energy factors she talked about how the bills of course play into inflation that's why we continue to see inflation go up everyone in Europe that I know including myself by the way I've seen my bills go up pretty much every month now for three months and of course that plays into their mandates she repeated she insisted we have to get to a 2% target we are going to continue to hike there is potentially a recession that will manifest but nonetheless we need to hit our mandate that is 2% so the message for me today in this conference is that even in a recession the European Central Bank come December will hike again they will hike into recession the question is 50 basis points 75 basis points but the direction of travel is very clear she laid it out today very clearly we have to hike even though we're potentially going to be in a recession and Henry Hurdern we've been talking about the collision course that we've been seeing so far from the monetary policy and the fiscal policy makers the congress members in the US politicians around the world who do not want to see people lose their jobs it is bad for them who don't want to see the economic pain but right now it's okay because the pain hasn't gotten that deep how much has that pushback really spread beyond just a small cadre of of people in congress right now well it hasn't ready spread within the democratic party right this was the voices of say you had independent from Vermont Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren really starting that but then also as a October before the last fedeism you had top democrat Sheridan Brown writing this letter to chair Powell saying do not forget about the unemployment market we don't want to see the risks of jobs as you go on this aggressive campaign to fight inflation basically make sure the medicine is not worse in terms of the current",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,515,2022-11-18 11:24:14
17902," Upps, as you go on this aggressive campaign to fight inflation, basically make sure the medicine is not worse in terms of the cure. We want to make sure that at the same time you're fighting inflation, you have to keep the employment picture positive. And what you're going to likely see, and now we're going to have a split congress, is that potentially this will grow louder on a bipartisan basis. Republicans will likely use the inflation story to continue to attack the Biden administration, but I don't think that means the feds out of the clear from some swipes from the GOP, either. Henry Horton, thank you so much for safe travels. I believe we'll see Ms. Horton here in the next hour. As well, Maria, today, thank you so much for joining us from Europe today. I want to dive into the world of Bramow. We can do this on bonds. There's full faith in credit. There's quality corporates. There's garbage. And then there's high yield distress. And none of them ever talked about. The media takes total focus on full faith in credit. What's a 10-year-do in blah, blah, blah. And all this uproar, including in version now, 69 basis points, how is the relationship of garbage to quality corporates move this week? You have seen a greater rally in higher quality corporates rather than the garbage, as you say. I thought you were going to dive into the world of Bramow, and it's super depressing. So get ready for the world as winter is here. And you're at my mid you had earlier. But how much are we looking at really a lack of recognition in the credit markets, akin to what some people say in certain pockets of the equity markets? People are still looking for yield. And I think that you can see companies that still have cash piles, that still have debt that they don't have to refinance, so it hasn't hit them as quickly, which is one reason why you haven't seen those defaults yet. I don't want to catch you on a wears here. Lisa, we don't rehearse this, folks. Me, John and Lisa, we just talk. We don't even talk. We don't talk. We don't talk because, again, stand each other. That's a different story. But this week something happened from my youth. There was a bond offering involving leverage buyouts, private equity, whatever, where the paper sat on Wall Street's desk. They couldn't sell it. Reptor on Tennico and Apollo was involved too well. And I don't want to get into the gossip of it. But what's its signal when you're doing transactions and paper sits on the desk of Wall Street? It's been happening more and more. There are billions of dollars still sitting on the Wall Street balance sheets. Yeah, I mean, the latest was Twitter, right? I'm surprised this isn't more in the zeitgeist. But we talked about that with Twitter. If you want to bring it down to one story, what happens with all the Twitter debt on bank balance sheets right now? What, 12 to $14 billion, especially as you see, is complete eradication evaluation, at least perceived in the exodus of staff and some of the concerns about advertisers, etc. What does Wall Street do, right? And the theory is, is that, right? Well, the lower the price in the yield goes up, making it more attractive, but even then they can't move it. From a bigger standpoint, banks are not going to be able to do it. They're not going to collapse. US banks are not going to collapse, but they might restrain lending to corporations, to consumers. And that's, I think, what people are looking for, withdrawal of credit from the world, rather than any kind of potential vulnerability. Good news, the VIX in 23.73.

What should somebody do to get into the talent agency business or the business you're in? Well, it's hopefully what I've taught my kids. You've got to be intellectually curious. You've got to be, you've got to show up and you know this like I know this. I got on a lot of plans.

Lisa, this is an evolving story. I haven't seen many headlines in the last 10 minutes. But even in the last two hours, Joe Weisenthal, the stalwart, what did I miss? Well, Gopin, even Joe is out there wondering if this is the last day of Twitter. Well, and this is because of the Exodus. Interesting to see some Democratic senators put out a letter overnight, basically asking the US Federal Trade Commission to look into whether Twitter breached certain consumer protection laws because of some of the turmoil you're seeing this with European regulators. We're saying that they need to install some moderators. There's a whole host of back and forth from regulatory agencies as well. Fugus is up 25 downfugus is up 145. Nice lift to the market.

Anders Limen joins us, senior portfolio manager, managing director Morgan Stanley here to pick up the pieces. Andrew, I love, love, love your note. You go shut up and look at the other 490 of the 500 S&P stocks. Where's the value? Wow. That's a long way.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,517,2022-11-18 11:33:01
17904," Love your note. You go shut up and look at the other 490 of the 500 S&P stocks. Where's the value? Well, the fact is the market might be down 20-20 percent. The most stocks are down a lot more than that. And the cap-weighted index has been held up by the really big boys and the rest of the stocks are down much more. And so when people say, well, Andrew, do you think we're going to have a recession next year? I say there's so many stocks out there that already reflect the recession. So, you know, I think there's left downside if in fact a recession or an earnings recession especially comes to a point. I'm assuming that a grizzled vector like you is linking value, PE forward PE with persistent quality free cash flow. Where do you find that among the beleaguered 490? Well, you're absolutely right. I think, you know, at the end of the day, I'm a believer that wage inflation is here to stay. I think ultimately we won't get the 2 percent. And that means over the next, you know, you name the year is 5, 7 years. I think what you pay for something is going to be as important if not more important than the growth rate of a company. And so when I look through, there are a lot of stocks that as I said are down now value. Obviously, there's a lot of value stocks, financials, I think are very attractive. But I'm intrigued by some of these consumer discretionary stocks. I know that's hard to believe, but with that is very negative. And so eventually the direction of change is inevitably going to move the other way. And can I find some stocks in that area? And I think a lot of these interest rates sensitive stocks that have gotten killed because mortgage rates are up. I think that is if we get rates start to come down even though their businesses might deteriorate, they deteriorate at such low multiples in the home area. I think that's attractive. So it's not just value stocks. There's some growth areas that have really been beaten down killed. I think tech's been beaten down, but a lot of those multiple sales team a little harder. So I don't want to create drama. And I realize that Morgan Stanley investment management isn't Morgan Stanley the investment bank. But you differ quite substantially with Michael San, your peer over at Morgan Stanley, who thinks that there is probably another like much lower and that we are reaching perhaps the last gas of this bear market rally. You think that we have further to go that there's something more substantial. Where do you guys disagree? I mean, do you guys sort of sit on opposite sides of the of the lunchroom or do you guys hash it out and have some sort of you know, agree to disagree kind of moment? Yeah, now Mike's a good friend of mine. We sit on a committee together where I've disagreed with Mike this year is the earnings story. I've thought that earnings would come through strong this year and they and they have, but he's been more right on the Fed pivoting and the defects of the PE compression. I think he's going to direction be right next year in terms of earnings are too high. And the S&P cap weight he might be more right. All I'm saying is look, I if you say are you bullish on the S&P cap weighted? I'm not I'm not all about the comfort on that. I just think there are a lot of other stocks from a stock picking standpoint that are a lot more, you know, the outlook is very positive because of where they come down. So I'll let him call the S&P cap weighted. I do think he's going to be right direction on earnings revisions. I just think if the fee if the Fed eventually takes a foot off the break, you're going to see some PE expansion for some of these areas that have been so compressed. I'm not sure it's the S&P cap weighted. What does that mean then, Andrew, with respect to your view on tech because that seems to be the big delineator between the market with the cap weighted S&P versus real gains under the hood? Yeah, I was really struck by the third quarter earnings conference calls. To the extent that many of these companies, they acted as if they could sail right through a slowdown economy. I think when I think about it, it's probably",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,518,2022-11-18 11:37:13
17905," any of these companies, they acted as if they could sail right through slowdown the economy. I think, you know, when I think about it, it's probably because in 2008, 2009, these companies are so busy grabbing market share that they really didn't feel the effects of the economic slowdown. Now you fast forward to today and clearly the economy is slowing, but they, you know, they haven't really had a cyclical slowdown before. And I think that's what's in front of them. So that really kind of worried me when I heard the conference called coming at a time when, you know, the government is slowing their ability to acquire companies. And if you look back at the history, these companies really grew by a lot of both on acquisitions. And that's not happening as quickly anymore. So I think the growth rate is really challenged for some of these very big companies. And you're reading my script. You and I remember when like Lemons off a cliff, they were rolled up. Remember specialty chemical? It was like Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, six rollups of an industry. My theme for next year is the great zombie rollup. Now that we have a risk free rate that's legitimate, all the ramifications, including crypto of the price of money actually matters now. Do you anticipate that zombies across all industries will be put out of their misery? Well, yeah, I don't know about that. But what I do know is what work in the last bull market, you know, these overgrowth stocks, I think they're going to still have trouble because even though they're down a lot, I think, you know, they could rally into your end if we get this little rally. But eventually when the market stands up and says, oh my gosh, we're not going back to low inflation, low growth environment, I think that's the next, you know, leg down that people are going to say, oh my gosh, I got to be careful what I pay for stock, don't buy last bull market winners. And everyone finds that reminded me Tom, that so reminds me of 2001 where all the way down after that couple of people kept asking me, hey, what do you think about the darlings of the previous? That's critical. Okay, we're going to rip up the script here. Andrew, thank you so much. This is really, really important folks. Andrew and I remember that what we massively got wrong was a calculation of profitability in 99 and 00 onto the debacle of 01. Is that shadow out there right now? Andrew that maybe were miscalculating across the four accounting statements of the might and the power of these profitable companies? Well, I could be wrong. These large cap tech stocks could continue to do well. But I do think Tom that profitability is going down because wage inflation is not, you know, there's a third group that's standing up and saying we want to participate. We didn't participate 2010 to 2019. We want to participate. There's a, the pie's got to be cut another way, which means margins are, I think, are more permanently going down, which means profitability is going down, which means earnings growth is going down. That means the return for the market overall are not going to be as good the next five years. I don't believe that, but I believe, given the structure of the S&P, there are huge opportunities underneath the surface. It's just again, the cap weighted. I'm less optimistic about. Andrew Simon, thank you so much. Greatly appreciate it. Morgan Stanley there. Rook clinic on how you frame out courage to stay in the market. Again, it is a multiple story Friday here.

Like basically these are the moment. But honestly, with with respect to crypto, the big question mark is why hasn't there been a huge capitulation of washout when it seems like such major players are having some serious issues and a lot of people say they don't really know the answer and",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,519,2022-11-18 11:41:36

17908, in GDP next year and that economic growth should be the urgent priority to get it back to a normal track and reason playing. And I have stated my number one variable for 2023 within you know zombie roll up and all that is China. China is a mystery and I can't imagine the political socio-political pressure to get back to 5% growth. Yeah well and this is to be remarkable. The fact that central bankers are talking about this and talking about adjusting monetary policy to respond to a possible reopening so that there isn't too much inflation. Right. Really kind of feeds this feeling in markets that perhaps they're preparing for some real shift in policy on a number of different fronts that could question some of the other domestic issues like for example commodities. And it dovetails into Brent crude 89 13 West Texas intermediate 81 32 giving it back on demand worries. We are briefed by Emerita Sen of energy aspects this morning. Emerita help me with a recent pullback in oil is it just a bad demand won't be there. Now I think there's a lot of confusion in the market right now right and yes demand in China is weak and this is something we've been saying for some time. Don't get too excited by all the headlines coming out of China about reopening because that reopening isn't happening till April of next year. So right here right now there are more lockdowns so absolutely demand in China will remain weak now. Yeah. The thing is the rest of the world demand is actually pretty decent and the numbers coming in have actually surprised to the upside and not downside. So how does that frame up for next year every you know 100 page report I skim through says Pacific Rim demand is the variable. If we get what Lisa talks about 5% China GDP growth does that reverse you out to $120 a barrel? Absolutely China is going to be critical for next year's balances and I think again if you look at what has caused this year's kind of softness it's been China. It's not that we were expecting a reopening but these renewed lockdowns have actually dented demand quite substantially more than we all the market was expecting and I think that's one of the biggest reasons why China is not out buying crude right now. They are going to be the biggest variable for next year especially given all the uncertainties around Russian oil with the EU embargo kicking in on the 5th of December. We are going to lose some Russian barrels but that is again going to be after the product embargo on the 5th of February so the timing is going to be critical that if China starts to reopen from April the real upside are the real tightening and balances is going to be then. Why is the bull case for oil not coming to fruition now given that we are getting a bit colder now and that we do have a bit more resilient of US economy? Yeah I mean look there's a lot of urine positioning going on as well but what I would and this gets a little bit technical to bear with me but I think what's been interesting is you know now I've seen a lot of kind of narrative around this that a crude has obviously sold off and that just means everything is very bearish. If you look at the products markets pretty much every single product and all of them in Asia are backordated that tells you that the underlying demand conditions are strong usually when the market is wobbling because of fundamentals it tends to come for the product side but if you look at gasoline diesel even fuel oil and after which had been weaker have old strength and over the course of the month. So this is more of a macro thing that's driving crude stronger dollar obviously worries about continuous rate hikes. We had even correlation with Bitcoin which is just insane and tells you that not that many specialists are trading crude oil right now and policy uncertainty which we've talked about on this show before as well is just not helping. We don't know because of the amount of even media reports constantly contradicting one another like we have very strong views about the EU embargo but people are telling us clients are telling us oh do you think Europe is going to go ahead with the embargo and I think that's what's creating a lot of confusion in the market. So even putting aside all of that confusion when you hear from people who say that actually Europe isn't a much better position than they previously were not just for this winter but for next winter. Do you pay credence to that? Do you feel like crisis averted regardless of what happens in Russia and Ukraine and that there has been immunization from the conflict? I'd say right now sure Europe is in a much more comfortable position because it's been mild.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,522,2022-11-18 11:54:33
17909," has been immunization from the conflict? I'd say right now, sure, Europe is in a much more comfortable position because it's been mild and we have a bunch of allergy cargo sitting waiting to be discharged. But if it does get cold and I really dread to think how people can say that next year is going to be fine as well. We can get through this winter, assuming it's a mild enough winter, no problem. Next year, there's a huge issue. And by the way, this is much more a gas story than an oil story. Oil, we haven't lost Russian oil to begin with. So I don't understand why, even if the talk of ceasefire again, which we completely disagree with to begin with, but let's say it does gain credence, how does it affect oil? Because oil wasn't impacted, so why should oil sell off now? If, you know, even if there is a ceasefire, and that's where I think the market is very confused, and you're just getting like, like, sweet of just macro sell off an oil getting caught in with them. And we have one final unfair question, and that all of a sudden money costs something. The risk-free rates, legitimate, all of a sudden, the investment calculation is like we remember. Do you assume there'll be a boost in energy production in what politicians of all ilk are calling for, which is more production? Are you optimistic hydrocarbon producers will produce more at the margin? No. And for two simple reasons. One, shareholders continue to tell them not to do so, and prioritize green energy. And two, because interest rates are going up, again, servicing debt just gets a lot more expensive. This is the other problem we're seeing in the US. US production isn't rising particularly sharply, and I think the market will realize this next year. But, of course, the problem for the US is that freight rates have skyrocketed, so moving that oil has become extremely expensive. And I think that's actually going to be a double-warmie and way on US production even further. Emeritus Sen, thank you so much. Always a clinic. She is with energy aspects, just outstanding as well. There it is, Lisa. It's under the zeitgeist, and it's going to become the zeitgeist, the expense of interest. Interest rate expense. Interest rate of the federal debt, name the country. Interest expense to Exxon. Interest expense to even Apple with their, you know, the minimum coupon as well, interest rates are rising. That's a bill do. Well, it's not do yet, and I think that's why people are still going to credit. Fair. I'm just thinking about what I'm reading, I was talking about how the financialization of the oil market has just completely changed the dynamic and doesn't give you the same signal and pricing, which is what everyone's been trying to give an narrative. Maybe it doesn't really make sense to do that. Some interns said to me, should I read the prize by Daniel Yurgen, and I said, it's timeless. That's what you can do about oil.

And what's the greater pleasure making five times your money on a Distress Dead investment or winning the NBA championship? They're both fabulous. I wish I could do one each year, that would be great, but I think there's a great feeling in being right on an investment, that you've done a tremendous amount of work and you've made money for your clients, which I think is great. I think winning a championship is, it's a very surreal feeling because there's a whole city or state that is actually behind you. You know, we had 70,000 people at the finals and we had them all outside. It's 17,000 in stands and then literally like 60,000 people outside. And when we won, like just the joy that you had brought to the city was phenomenal. The top names in climate change are on Bloomberg. Building out local wind, local solar, hydrogen, these are solutions to not just climate issues but geopolitical issues. We are in a position by 2030 to 80% of all electricity generated by wind. Newables are the safest, the cleanest and the cheapest form of energy today, especially for countries such as Greece. Nobody covers climate change like Bloomberg, your global business authority. During the early stages of a sustainability revolution that has the magnitude of the industrial revolution coupled with the speed of the digital revolution. Nobody covers climate change like Bloomberg, your global business authority. The market is getting poised for breakout even more inverted from here. The market's strengths has brought with it looser financial conditions which is not what the Fed wants. This is Bloomberg surveillance with Tom Keane, Jonathan Farrow and Lisa Abramowitz. Good morning everyone, Jonathan Farrow, Lisa Bramowitz and Tom Keane on radio on television, Bloomberg surveillance, forget about sliding into the weekend and extraordinary news. So David Bailyn will be with us in moments after Andrew Slimman to go to David Bailyn's decades of perspective of what to do on the market. But neither of them know what to do on Twitter. Lisa, there's no other story, 10 o'clock, 11 o'clock East Coast time last night. The dawning awareness Twitter could be toast. Well, the fact that a lot of employees are leaving and some of them are even warning that potentially it might have trouble operating. It has not had trouble operating and all these people tweeted all of these last tweets and you know, these last wishes to all of our listeners and followers and then you know, of course they wake up and it's still working. So we'll see what happens, but it's going to be an issue for a broader swath of regulators as well as of course, what are they going to do with the fact that Elon Musk just paid all that money for this firm? Well, that's a financial side. You mentioned that last hour, Justin Wolffers, he acclaimed Australian economist. Good morning Ann Arbor, Michigan Wolffers. We're finally going to see a Musk product in self-driving mode. That really puts that really puts that really puts the true together. Yeah, absolutely. And he's went chief twit and he basically is saying, you know, we want to be hardcore. If you're going to be hardcore press here, nobody did. So that's where we're everywhere. Justin is so cut and chiseled. He runs the marathon. He runs a new city marathon and actually competes with the heavyweights up front as well. I mean, there we are on Twitter and BitDog. What do we do up $200 from yesterday's OMG? It's all going to die. No, it isn't. There's a bigger question here about all of these pockets of stress that we see and there are some of idiosyncratic Twitter.

17911," There's a bigger question here about all of these pockets of stress that we see. And there are some idiosyncratic Twitter. There are some more systemic potentially bitcoin or maybe idiosyncratic given where FTX is. Why have we not seen the big kaboom from the withdrawal of liquidity from markets? And that's been one of the questions, especially given some of the hawkish speak, not only from the fed speakers, but also from the CP President Christine Lagarde earlier this morning. Well, Lagarde making important comments, folks. This has been floating here through the warning, and for those of you that join us for our entire three hours, Mandi Singh will join us here later in the hour. He is expert on what goes on behind the building, behind that single headquarters of Twitter in California. Right now, we've got to look at the financial story with the data, futures up 25 down futures up 153 VIX, Ques and 23.70. But Lisa, before your brief, we've got to look at further curve inversion just in the last 24 hours. What does that mean? This means that people are getting paid more to go short term than they are to go long term to lend long term. This raises a question of recession pretty much without a doubt. And you're seeing this curve inversion across the board, including the Fed yield curve, which has been a big issue. Why are we not seeing it reflected in certain pockets of optimism that still around? Let me walk to Suez in amateur. So, oils off in the last 24 hours, Brent under 90, OMG, slow down 10 year yield price up yield down. Is that how you get to further inversion? Exactly. Well, actually price down yield up, not as much as yields are up on the front end. That's what it's been all week. Right? So there's been this question of again, the Fed raising rates to restrictive levels. What we're looking at right now, though, is how much has already been priced in? And what is the consequence of that? That's been a big issue. Give me a brief here. You lost me there in the last dynamics there. Two-stent spread. I'm sorry, it's confusing math any day of the week. And not, you know, Friday week, we just can't do that. And I confused you even more. So we're going to be speaking for central bankers who are going to be perhaps creating a more clear discussion over in Europe. We've got Buddhist bank president Joachim Nagle, ECB's class, not at 815 and Bank of Atlanta, Catherine Mann at 815. I'm very interested here from them. Catherine Mann out of MIT real issue hawk. I think so. She's like, let's go, let's go raise it. She's on the edge of Bullard. Let's hear what she has to say and how she nuances it into a downturn. Susan Collins at 830 from the Boston Fed. At 10 a.m., we get US existing home sales. How much do we see just the number of sales fall off a cliff? We saw home builder sentiment fall off a cliff to levels that we haven't seen going back more than a decade if you strip out the pandemic ramifications, a fast moving story. And I'm right that this is is a richer data series than one number. There's more data underneath it. There is, but here's the issue. How is it is the first ball to drop, right? That is typically the first industry to get affected most severely from rate hike. So how much do people glean some sort of insight in what's going to happen to the broader economy after that? And on Sunday, the World Cup is beginning in Doha. And I'm very curious to see how that transpires and how that distracts everyone. So on Faxon will join us. She is there in Doha. She'll be with us here in a bit. Right now, David Balan, Chief Investor and Officer Glowhead of Investments, it's city global wealth. David, I'm not surprised to hear you say quality is in order for 2023, but color the quality. What does it look like? Well, it's those stocks that, you know, going to continue to earn money all the way to next year without a decline. Those stocks that they dividends that they buybacks. Well, you and Lisa were just talking about is incredibly important because the Fed has raised rates and is going to raise rates more looking at the data on inflation that is behind it, the leading, you know, the lagging indicators. That's what they're looking at. And as a result, they're going to have rates go too high and they're going to keep them there for too long. And if they do that, we are going to have not only recession, but potentially is seriously, you know, serious, in terms of its length and potentially its breath. And that's really what's being set up here. And the market, you know, looks at it somewhat saying, when, you know, with the saying when lens, and I think that's a mistake because really what we're dealing here is potentially with an earnings decline that is not yet priced into the market for 2023. The earnings decline assumes also revenue decline. Do you just assume with the dearth of nominal GDP off the oddities of the last 24 months that revenue growth comes in as well as earnings?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,525,2022-11-18 12:07:38
17912," to decline. Do you just assume with the death of nominal GDP off the the the oddities of the last 24 months at revenue growth comes in as well as earnings? What actually is going to come in Tom is the is the is the profit margin right revenues will go up of course with inflation but costs are going to go up more than that. The ability for people who produce goods to actually pass on price increases is going to go away and the reason is because inventories are extremely hot and what inventories do is they you know they drive prices down so we'll be able to buy you know think is less expensively during this coming you know Black Friday and Christmas season but ultimately it's going to make profits you know go down next year and I think it's going to cause you know the economy to slow more than people think because you know once inventories build like this then production you know future production will be reducing disproportionately downward. David I want to sit on something that you said that potentially because of as going to raise rates far beyond people think even in the face of weakness that is happening more rapidly than perhaps people realize this is going to lead to a long and potentially deep recession right I mean that's essentially what you're saying and then that's not being priced in I'm looking right now to Nasdaq down 28% this year I'm looking at an S&P down 16% this year where is it not being priced in? Well you see no if you actually take a look at recessions historically you know they they could see markets down you know easily between 30 and 40% but this is the most important single line that you know I think people are missing markets have never bottomed before a recession has begun look back at the historical data and that's why you know you see these bear market rallies you see short covering you see the fact that we're in the fourth quarter and the fourth quarter is always a good quarter you know all those things are true too but what we have to do is actually price in what is going what is going to happen in the future and when you said earlier you know let's take a look at housing as a leading indicator right right now you know housing houses the houses that were started a year ago when interest rates was 3% need to be completed so the amount of housing unemployment that's taking place is virtually zero we think that there'll be 400,000 people unemployed in housing next year and about 2 million people who will be unemployed across the economy which is not especially deep recession but it's certainly not positive employment growth as we've seen almost all year long David what does this mean in terms of what you're recommending to share clients I mean if they're talking about a long and deep recession is it's hideout and tenure treasuries is this hiding out in T-bills until we have a better sense of what's going to happen yeah we are deeply wavly so over we are deeply overweight bonds at the moment you know we think that bonds are going to be a terrific investment by the way because you know if you buy a 10-year bond today let's say 380 right and it happens to go to you know 3% and you hold it for a year and change you know that total return on that bond could be 10% because we think interest rates are going to be down a year to a year and a half from now you know we think the long term rate on the 10-year community between 250 and 3 and that's because once a recession begins rates will of course you know come down and once we have unemployment prints for a couple of months yeah I will finally realize there's vocal did they have to do something about it well your economics team and good morning Andrew Hollinor's has been way out front on the slowdown that called David Bale and we've got a stagger to December 2nd and all of a sudden the jobs report which is of interest are we going to see the unemployment rate move in December yet or does that await till the first week of January well it certainly could you know Tom the the rate has come down relatively little so far you know but what we're seeing are you know the postings come down we're seeing a lot of pre-announcements of layoffs all across the tech industry some of the names you were talking about you know are are planning you know 10 and 15 thousand you know layoffs index you know next year but those haven't happened yet and of course we haven't seen this sort of industrial companies right off anybody because of the hoarding of labor David thank you for the brief David Bale and city group global wealth just thrilled to have them on today right now Santa and porous 500 up eight tens of a percent 31 points a nice lift to the market off the radar even though Emory Hardin is in Indonesia this this is completely out of the zeitgeist this morning EM reacting to what Lagarde's talking about Em reacting to what Paul's talking about the Philippines were they fed like 75 basis point rate increase and Jakarta comes on just behind with a rate rise is that a precursor to what Damien says our season to next year if you take a look at the outlooks that are starting to trick a lot of wall",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,526,2022-11-18 12:12:01
17913," And Jakarta comes on just behind with a rate rise. Is that a precursor to a Damien Sess overseas in the next year? If you take a look at the outlooks that are starting to trick a lot of Wall Street, we're actually very constructive at emerging markets next year, almost all of them. And the reason why is- Nothing we're last year too, right? And it could be wrong, but the theory behind them, I'm not saying that, but I'm just saying, yeah, go for it. But what I'm trying to say here is that basically people have seen how much they've already hiked rates and for the potential for them to perhaps move off and be ahead of the curve a little bit more. And that's why you've seen a bit more resilience in certain areas. But yeah, they have to. They have to keep up with the Fed. And this is the reason why certain markets are going to get crushed by the fact that the Fed is going to go as high as some people think. The headline there from Bailyn is something you'd hear from the wonderful and great Dan Fuss. Under crisis, price up and yield down, I believe, is what I heard as a city group call. Futures up 30 down futures advance up 185. Nice lift to the market, getting back in their SPX 4000. This is Bloomberg surveillance. Stay with us on radio and television. Keeping you up to date with Newsom around the world with the first word, I'm Lisa Mateo. European Central Bank president Christine Lagarde says interest rates may need to be lifted to levels that restrict economic expansion in order to drive down inflation. Lagarde adds that the risk of recession has also increased, but that a downturn on its own won't be sufficient to tame soaring prices. The ECB is expected to raise borrowing costs to 2% or more next month. A Swedish investigation into the ruptures at the Nord Stream one and two gas lines finds the causes, quote, grievous sabotage. The investigation will continue analyzing the sections where the damage occurred. An explosive resident resident was found. The pipeline which crosses the Baltic Sea to Germany from Russia is a focus of a pro by authorities in Sweden after two leaks were discovered. And a group of Democratic senators are asking the U.S. Federal Trade Commission to look into whether Twitter breached consumer protection laws under Elon Musk's ownership. In a letter to the Dems claim that the laws of key executives who oversaw privacy, cybersecurity and integrity at Twitter, it calls into question whether personal data is adequately protected. Meanwhile, Twitter has closed its offices until Monday after Musk gave an ultimatum to either commit to working long hours at high intensity or to leave.

17914," I know I deal with that all the time. This is really a people first company. In an inflationary environment you're going to see us continue to lead with our people. Do you worry at all about a price wage spiral? Not just here, but in the industry, in the economy? Yes, and I think that you know this is something that you know many business leaders are focused on. And you know time will tell kind of how all of this lands. I think the ways for our spiral continues for quite some time. And I think we probably have been a lot less aggressive than we can be. And then many other companies have been. In terms of raising prices. Yes, we've taken our time. If you look at a 20-year history of pricing in this company, we've taken about 2% of your own average. We've never taken what we could. We've always taken what we should. We have to pay people more. We have been and will continue to do so. We'll take a little bit of a margin compression on that as we've had to. And I think that's the right thing.

For me, the hours come for a new generation to lead the Democratic caucus that I so deeply respect. Nancy DeLosandro of Baltimore, on the Nancy Pelosi of California in historic moment scene in Washington. Yesterday, Lisa Bramitz and Tom King, John Farrell off today. We'll get right to it with the discussion of the speaker and Rehorden. Join some Indonesia picking up the pieces of the G20 meeting. Emory, I remember Speaker Ray Burns. Sam Rayburn, who sat behind Roosevelt in 1941 for the day of infamy speech. And had three bouts of speaker. He was, whether you liked him or hated him, whatever the politics was, he was dominant in the middle of the 20th century. Compare and contrast that to the dominance of Nancy Pelosi. What will be her legacy? Well, I think there's no question she was a force within not just the Democratic Party, but the entire Congress. I mean, when you see the reverence the Democrats have for her, but then at the same time, the respect her opponents on the Republican side. Of course, for the far right, she was really enemy number one. And we've seen that most sadly seen that recently with the attack on her.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,528,2022-11-18 12:20:36
17915," I mean, number one, and we've seen that, and most sadly, seen that recently with the attack on her husband. But look at what Representative Tom Cole from Oklahoma said. This is someone that you begrudgingly respect. It's like seeing the best player on the team you hate. That's who she was for a lot of Republicans. I mean, the legislation, if you think about over the years that she was able to push through, she is obviously leaving a huge historic mark, not also because she was the first female, but a huge historic mark on Congress. It's been a huge focus, Anne-Marie, on the Republicans, is over to Trump, MAGA, et cetera, or Centrist Republicans. And very little about how the Democrats readjust does a new minority leader for the Democrats in the House readjusts centrist or readjusts to the comfortable progressive liberal side. I think they're going to have to balance both sides. The way Speaker Pelosi did. I mean, there's not going to be, there's not this contensuous relationship, though, like you're seeing on the Republican side in the sense of who they should put up. It does seem like everyone is coalescing around Hockey and Jeffries to take that number one spot. And then, of course, today we have just 15 minutes ago or so the representative from Massachusetts, Kathleen Clark, coming out looking for the number two spot as a whoop, as a whip. And these individuals are able to, they've been able to both talk to the moderates at the same time also the progressives, especially Hockey and Jeffries. He has been incredibly influential, influential, when it comes to that bridge in terms of the moderates and the progressives, getting the progressives on side or saying to the progressives, I'm sorry, but we have to get this legislation through. I'm going to have to side with the moderates. But it obviously is going to be a different shift because it's a generational shift. These are very different individuals and players. But of course, they're still going to be a hoyer around. They're still going to be close to you around, cli-borne around, and they are going to really act as those mentors. But Speaker Pelosi said it interesting to a number of reporters that she doesn't want to be the mother-in-law in the kitchen on Thanksgiving dinner saying, my son doesn't like to make the stuffing that way. She is going to let that. Well, that never happened at the Horton House. We never saw that at the Horton House. Did we Lisa? At the Horton House, the mother-in-law never stepped in to say how to make the tomato sauce? My extensive experience in the Horton House can confirm that never happened in the Horton House. And, Mary, I am curious if there is some sort of bipartisan agreement when it comes to Twitter, when it comes to social media and how much it's important to get a better sense of what's happening on a pretty fast-moving story. Well, it's so funny because on the right, they have been going after Twitter and Facebook in terms of how they have, at some times, blocked individuals. Look at the right now, the leader of the Republican Party, is still the former president. He's not even allowed on their social media site. And now you're hearing from Democrats writing a letter to the FTC saying, please look into what Mr. Muske is doing at this company of a number of executives leaving. These people were responsible for cybersecurity, for privacy. A lot of this comes down to this 2011 consent decree that Twitter had with the FTC was protecting personal data. And right now, there's a tremendous amount of concern on Capitol Hill that this is potentially going to be worrisome for consumers, worrisome for privacy. So this is one of those moments, Lisa, where you could see Republicans and Democrats come together. Emory Horton, thank you so much. Greatly appreciated today. World Cup Chat right now, Chris Leason, I really up the street. Right.

Mr. Kane was leading this. I know he heard a caness.

17916," And they look, talk her to out is how I would put it. Mr. Kane was leading this. I know we heard it canes. They shifted to the wintertime because it was just too, too darn hot in the summer times. They had to really shift gears a little bit. But you know, honestly, we'll be watching that. We'll be speaking with Simone Foxman who's over there in just a little bit. One thing that I wanted to follow on from yesterday, Tom, we were talking a lot about earnings and we got more earnings from retailers and they were better than expected. Gap in particular. I mean, just this ongoing sense, raw stores better than expected. Each story is different. People are still spending. And this is the reason why it's so hard to get a sense. And the reason why so many people are saying that perhaps the better than other central banks are going to go further than people think in buried in the zeitgeist of a Friday morning in England, retail sales within their massive gloom recessionary gloom, retail sales were it was a bounce back at least from what it was in the previous 30 days. Again, thank you, Dana Chelsea of Chelsea Advisory go for fabulous perspective this week. Do you think it's yellow like post pandemic? You only live once. Might as well. I think there is an element to that, particularly in the way the airlines are packed, which I did not predict. I got that wrong. I mean, that's been persistent and we heard all the guidance from all the airlines and that's ongoing through the holidays. So regardless of people stop spending on things. And again, overnight you and I haven't talked about this, but there was a report in the last 24 hours of charge card debt. Is I think ballooned is the right word. It's it's really spiked up as people get out the plastic to try to get the December? Well, how much are people leveraging up to plug the gap from their income versus the inflation adjusted expensive everything? And that's something that, you know, again, how do we dovetail the strength now into the weakness that so many people are expecting? We're going to look at the world cup here in a moment. We're also going to come back and talk to Jane Fully about foreign exchange and whether the dollar sterling at 119 is at a sterling week, if you will, even given all the challenges in England. And then we are going to talk about Twitter for all of you of global Wall Street with a melstrom since 10 o'clock. Last night, Mandi Singh will give us perspective here, not to calm things down because they are not calm on what we see at Twitter in San Francisco.

This is me going out in Hustland, bringing that money back, and just building it, building it, and building it. Yeah, I think about a person that was homeless at one point, didn't really have a job. I think that's what I was thinking. I think that's what I was thinking. I think about a person that was homeless at one point, didn't really have any money coming in.

Welcome to the West News. the 80s I guess here through the next number of days. Simone, on Sunday, it is 60,000 people to see the first kick of I believe it's cutter and Ecuador. Exactly how hot will it be in the stadium? The last time I looked at the forecast, it was supposed to be I think the high 80s outside, but in the stadium it's gonna be pretty cool. A lot of these stadiums like Elbate that you see behind me, they have air conditioning technology, they've been built that way, even pretty efficient technology. I mean, I've been in some stadiums actually in the middle of August and they were still tolerable, not like cool. I understand Simone that for a girl from Columbia University of New York, you've never tasted Budweiser. I get that. I understand they don't serve it north of like 108th Street. What are they gonna do in this uproar about no alcohol, but they're gonna serve Bud zero. Where does that move to a Sunday first kick? Yeah, so this is in a big about face for organizers. They had initially said that fans would be able to purchase Bud Light within the stadium perimeter, outside the stands themselves. Now they've turned around and said, you can't do that. In fact, so no alcohol is going to be sold anywhere within the stadium perimeter. Alcohol is a really hot flashpoint for cutter and has been throughout the preparations for this event because this is a conservative Muslim country, public drunkenness, illegal, even alcohol drinking, pretty taboo. There's a lot of restrictions on where you can get alcohol. So folks are gonna be able to buy alcohol and Bud Light in the fan zones. They're gonna be able to go to restaurants, attach to hotels and buy it, hotels themselves. Most of them allow it, but it's not going to be allowed in the stadium perimeter and that's something, you know, that really upsets fans. Also, the fact that it's being announced about 48 hours before kickoff. Well, Simone, this phrase is a larger issue about the culture shift and how this is really...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,531,2022-11-18 12:34:00
17918," And that's something that really upsets fans. Also, the fact that it's being announced about 48 hours before kickoff. Well, Simone, this raises a larger issue about the culture shift and how this is really a unique world cup given that it's being held in Doha's, being held in the Middle East for the first time. And some of the controversy around how it got there, when it got shifted from those summer to the winter, how much is this an inclusive world cup with a buy-in of everyone versus one that still has fractures around the edges? There's certainly fractures around the edges. Yes, organizers have said they're going to tolerate everyone, all nationalities, all religions, all sexual orientations, but they've emphasized that they want people to be respectful of the culture. And on some end, we get reports like my own just a few weeks ago, where I saw an internization talking about how security forces wouldn't even approach people who were giving public displays of affection, even protesting for gay rights. Those are things that are completely taboo here, but they weren't going to touch them. At the same time, that report actually was very... I made a lot of people here angry, and I think that's what we're seeing, particularly with this alcohol decision. The locals not happy with seeing any alcohol at all, and that's why we're getting the move. Simone, John from England emails in and says, would you cut the chat chat and show the English team images yesterday? For those of you on Bloomberg Radio, it's a slightly charred and sweaty Harry Kane, and the English crew, is they consider... You know, they consider the football field yesterday. I thought they looked tuckered and fatigued as well. Simone, what's your favorite team to watch here at this tournament? Well, I'm a USA fan through the fact that they have made it back, has helped me avoid a lot of embarrassment so that they didn't make it to 2018 in Russia. But, you know, I'm actually watching the Danes, because they had a great run in the 2020 Euros, made it through to the semi-finals. You know, they're not in the top of the list for anybody in terms of actually winning the whole thing, but I'd like to see the orange come through. Listen to her with the football talks. She's killing me. Simone Foxman read in on the world cup. Yeah, exactly. Simone, thank you so much. And seriously, folks, the weather report that I see 10 days out for cutters, not as grim as maybe some people were expecting. We'll have to see on that. We'll look at the business of the world cup in this Foxman. And of course, we will look for the football of it with Mr. Farrow when he returns. And how dumb are we? We're like, we could dumb you. Well, and we forgive everyone for not watching us next week when you're watching the world cup instead, because that's probably where the focus will be ahead of the Thanksgiving break. We'll have a little icon that kind of gives a little. Come on, you watch the world cup and you listen to Bloomberg surveillance on Bloomberg radio at the same time. Yeah, perfect. And you get all the benefits of Farrow in his coverage of the Italian soccer team in their effort this year. It'll be good. Hopefully. Hopefully, hopefully. Well, Italy didn't make it. It's a joke. OK, except it's not a joke. One guy's been glad to say that was a single worst thing is Italy didn't make it. He says they've got the best fans seriously. Right now, Jane Foley joins us as we Seguri over to foreign exchange. Jane Foley knows we can do that as well. Jane, how do you readjust a week dollar here? When you write into 2023, how do you adjust to a new US dollar? You know, I think we've got some two way here. I think we clearly had the market very long position of the dollar. And we've had to clear in out of those positions, which is actually a relief to get this two way back. But you know, I don't think this is all over for the strong dollar trade. I think there's still a lot of pain to come in terms of the global economy. I think there's still a lot of hawkishness yet to come and fee through from the Fed. And this possibly, some sort of misdirection in terms of what the market is focusing on. We're all talking about peak dollar peak Fed. But actually, I think the message of one of the big themes of 2023 is going to be the lesson that inflation now is is is a lot more persistent. And I think that's where the focus is going to come through. There's several macro reasons the labor market particularly to expect inflation to be higher for longer. So that even if we reach peak rates, say in the spring, that rates will remain higher for longer. And that of course is a dynamic that the market's going to have to adjust to and that could mean that dollar strength, even if it comes off its highs will remain strong.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,532,2022-11-18 12:38:16
17919," could mean that dollar strength, even if it comes off its highs, will remain stronger for longer. But Jane, how do you factor in the fact that Europe has essentially escaped the worst case scenario of an energy crisis heading into a cold winter when it's actually warmer than expected, and it seems like they've stockpiled enough natural gas? I think that's what the market has been reacting to in the last few weeks. I think the Euro has certainly been lifted on the back of that. But actually, I think there's a lot more pain to come for Europe, even listening to Christine Lagarde this morning, warning about a pretty tough recession, warning that rates are going to have to become more persistent. You come into the scenario where the Bank of England is in, where you have a central bank hiking into recession, and the currency doesn't react to that. Bear in mind also that the Eurozone has had its current account position really impaired by the fact that it's importing so much expensive or has been importing so much expensive energy. And then, of course, we move on to winter 2023, which I think is going to be the real focus into early next year, because a lot of the gas that we have in Europe this year, now our systems are full, has come from Russia. Now, that's not going to be the case when we head into winter 2023. So yes, the Euro seems to be buoyant on the fact that it's warm and the gas prices has come down. But there's a lot more pain to come. So Jane, is everybody going to do trading for another two weeks and then go home? I mean, is this basically the last window where we get actual trading activity before people close up shop, closer books, go off on holiday? You know, I think the news is still coming thick and fast. I think there's going to be a lot of volatility. I mean, one thing that really doesn't just worry me is that if people, a lot of people do close off, then we potentially are going to have even more volatility if we have, you know, thin liquidity. So that's, you know, I think a potential risk going into the end of the year. To be honest, I think volatility is here to stay. I think that's just very much a function of the difficulties in moving for an environment of QE over to QT, for instance. I think the economic shocks are due, your politics, that the role still very much alive and kicking. And I think we're still going to be facing an awful lot of volatility in 2023. Jane, Folly, thank you so much. Greatly appreciate it this morning. It's too short of a visit. We'll do it longer next time. Jane Folly of Robble Bank there. And of course, on foreign exchange, it's not only about the speculation of what Yala dollar does, but it's a hedging as well, which has some real uncertainty into the new year. Many seems going to join us here, but we're going to take two minutes now to look at something Lisa. I've never, ever, ever seen on the Bloomberg terminal a spokesman of a major nation commenting on the validity of social media. Germany, Shulz spokesman, Germany watching Twitter with growing concern. You can't make this up. Well, I've shelt in his spokesman raising some issues with this. It comes as other European regulators actually have been weighing in as well. We heard earlier this morning that regulators were mandating that Twitter enforced some sort of moderation of the content, trying to prevent some of the trolling, some of the hate and some of the fake profiles or just simply replicating people maliciously Elon Musk defiant on Twitter. He posted one tweet of him with a sort of bird, a Twitter bird over his base going like this next to with the with the basically giving a signal as he looks at a grave that has Twitter on the great. But aren't there two stories going on in this Friday morning, folks, as you're waking up to this? One is Shulz regulation, social issues, if you will, on Twitter. And the other is the validity of the computer platform. Aren't there two separate stories going on here? The validity of the computer. Is that the script I got? Well, there's a regulation. There's a question of just the functioning of the company given how many people are saying the door, the door been laid off. And so how do they keep functioning right now? Everyone's been coming on Twitter and basically saying it seems like it's still here. It's still working. So, are you going to move to Instagram? I'm not. Instagram is not the same as Twitter, right? Very difficult to see where people are going to go. People are talking about mastodon and then you go and there's different, you know, different platforms. Mastodon as a thing. Yeah. And it's basically, you know, it says a lot for me. Twitter.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,533,2022-11-18 12:42:31
17920," people are going to go people are talking about mastodon and then you go and there's different you know different platforms. Mastodon is a thing. Yeah, and it's basically you know it says a lot. But but Twitter many. How do you deal with the fact though that you have a rogue kind of company that's the town hall that's a town square that people use and for everyone not just for individuals but also for companies. I mean this is massive rearranging of strategy. Stay with us on radio on TV. We're going to do a definitive discussion on this with someone with true computer experience Mandy saying well join us stay with us Bloomberg surveillance. Keeping you up to date with news from around the world with the first word I'm Lisa Mateo. Ukrainian forces continue to fend off Russian assaults in the east. Kiev is enduring long periods without power following multiple attacks on critical energy infrastructure across the country. Meanwhile Pope Francis said in an interview the Vatican is available to do quote everything possible to mediate president Flo Demir Zalensky maintains that only the return of territory taken by Russia will allow and to the war. Qatar officials are set to ban the sale of alcohol within its World Cup stadium. Now the move is a dramatic reversal of an earlier decision to allow Anheuser Bush to sell Budweiser beer Bloomberg has learned it will likely result in moving concession stands serving alcohol further away from the stadiums. The tournament kicks off Sunday with the host taking on Ecuador. North Korea has fired a suspected intercontinental ballistic missile a day after warning the U.S. over continued military drills with allies in the region. Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida says the missile probably landed inside the country's exclusive economic zone. And JP Morgan Chase made sweeping improvements to its employee benefits including getting 16 weeks of leave for the birth adoption of a child. The bank will increase sick days for full-time employees to 10 days from six and bump bereavement days to 20. Under a new policy, employees will also be eligible for up to four weeks paid time off to care for a seriously ill spouse domestic partner child or parent. The new benefits start January 1st.

I'm a little more skeptical about that China and the US both do not want to see nuclear force in the European continent The regulators here in the Bahá'uá is our ongoing with their investigation into FTX With unmatched reach in resources from more than 120 countries the moment news breaks 24 hours a day Bloomberg your global business authority We're in the early stages of a sustainability revolution that has the magnitude of the industrial revolution It's a couple with the speed of the digital revolution nobody covers climate change like Bloomberg your global business authority We will never break we will never break build on a foundation strong enough to stay we will never break I will write a roses and the mountains shake all over we'll remain we will never know we will never know So reality is inflation both here and globally is a problem and central banks have created or at least made the problem worse by staying too easy For too long after the pandemic and that liquidity and and that does that stimulus has to be so We're going to see in 2020 and particularly is true skill and experience with a bank of England wonderful to speak to Mr. Writing yesterday futures events up 7 tens of a percent nice lift to the market a persistent lift to the market this morning with higher yields 10 year yield not 4% 3.79% 2 year yield not 5% 4.49% in my headline this morning Within the broader markets is Brent crude from a 90 down to 88.38 Lisa Bramowitz and Tom King John Farrell on assignment no somebody emailed us he in Doha and I said I'm not sure but I he didn't make it to do Hi right he just said he's just the heat Milan wasn't there I mean come on he wasn't going to go if Milan's not going to do it.

Yeah we're doing the world cup coverage here doing better on World Cup football is widely anticipated this morning Mandy Singh joins us to say senior industry analyst for technology at Bloomberg intelligence barely colors his knowledge of what these people actually do with his New York University engineering. Mandy I'm going to go to the Bible the MIT technology review in an absolutely definitive article by Chris Stokele Walker a few days ago. Who are these people let's take it from butch Cassidy when an engineer sits in Twitter and looks at his screen whatever is responsibility. What do they actually do do they do code. Well so look I think with an app like Twitter you know you really have to think of all the functions.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,535,2022-11-18 12:51:01
17922," Do they do code? Well, so look, I think with an app like Twitter, you know, you really have to think of all the functionality and the features that the app has as well as the content site of it is moderated differently. But clearly the user experience comes from the fact that you know, you have to constantly improve features and make it easy for people to engage with the platform. Right. Both on the creator side and, you know, the consumer side. And in this case, because he is fired, you know, over 50% of the workforce without knowing who is critical to the development velocity and, you know, enhancing these features. It's hard for me to imagine that there is much going on in terms of changes to the app or really enhancing that app. And that to be the worry here because right now, you know, the focus is on content and firing people. But what do you do in terms of just improving the experience on an ongoing basis? The thrust of Stoke of Walker's MIT article with Ben Kruger, who actually worked at Twitter or works at Twitter right now. I'm not sure which is Ben Kruger really emphasizes the interdependencies of different engineering functions at any given company. Bring that over to the fear this morning in the zeitgeist that Twitter is going to shut down at any moment. Does the risk of a lack of interdependencies working lead to a shutdown of this social media platform? Especially if you're right, Tom, if they lose people on the infrastructure side in terms of who is really provisioning the app and making sure, you know, it can't handle these many users. Once you start losing people on the infrastructure side and these people are the ones who really are critical in terms of keeping everything up and running. That's where it becomes a problem. Even if you want to bring somebody over from Tesla, for example, or you know, one of his other companies, it's not that easy to figure out how do you maintain these critical systems and keep them, you know, live. And to me, that is the key challenge and advertisers, you know, are already pulling off because of the content moderation issues. They don't find the platform to be brand safe anymore. So there are a lot of problems both on the revenue side as well as just keeping that app and running. There's been a discussion about Max Exodus. Where do they go? Where do all the Twitter users go? The users can find, you know, other platforms. I think Instagram could be a beneficiary here as could, you know, some of the other smaller platforms that may come up as a viable alternative to Twitter. We still don't know what that could be, but look, this is the time to be thinking about, you know, an alternative to Twitter because clearly the creators are looking for something else. Then what Twitter has to offer. So there was just a $44 billion pie out Elon Musk put his personal wealth behind it to some degree, but so did Wall Street. So did a lot of investors. They invested in this debt Wall Street still sitting on those bonds. How much are they going to really pressure Elon Musk to get with it and get a strategy that's a little bit more effective and just, you know, trolling on Twitter. Yeah, look, I think once you know how much the revenue damage we have already seen, that's when you will start to see the pressure on Musk, you know, in terms of doing something about it. And right now his focus is the blue check and subscriptions, but guess what? Even that I think he's finding it hard to implement. So he can talk about a lot of things, but implementing it will require people who have knowledge of the app and it looks like they have fired a lot of those people. Amanda, Mr. Musk eight hours ago on Twitter, the best people are staying. So I'm not super worried. Do you agree are the best people staying? I don't think so. Not in his management style and you know, when you fire so many people and you ask them to work 80 hours. I mean, he's throwing all of the traditional management principles out of the window. And maybe he can, you know, keep the morale high just through his style and look is usually successful. So nobody can question that. But still I don't think you know, this is the way to retain talent and identifying people who are critical to your development velocity. Mandy, thank you so much. It's a great, great perspective there. As well, I don't know where to turn right now. I mean, crypto sort of born me this morning. We're up to.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,536,2022-11-18 12:55:29
17923," who are critical to your development velocity. Mandy, thank you so much. It's a great, great perspective there. As well, I don't know where to turn right now. I mean, crypto sort of born me this morning. We're up $200. We're going to, you know, we've got a nice rally on Bitcoin here, within all that. I guess we're waiting for headlines there. Are we waiting for headlines from Twitter? I don't know. What are we waiting for after Mandy's wisdom there? What are we exactly waiting for in Twitter? To understand what's going to happen next, it probably regulatory, any kind of pushback on that front. Which we've gotten from both the US as well as Europe. But how much does there really muscle behind that? I'm curious from the banks and the investors and some of this in the buyout. I mean, do they start saying, look, our investment's going to zero. Elon Musk, come on. This isn't working. You know, how much pressure is he going to get? And he's kind of an unconventional leader of a company. So it's not clear that he listens. I don't think I can't speculate on that as well. It used to be like the auctions, the mystery of what we'd see. Or now Fed speakers, the mystery of what we see. And to me, it all coalesces together into a middle November tension, the year rapidly ending. Money costs something now. That's the overwhelming change of all these different stories. Money costs something for Mr. Musk. It's true. And this is part of the reason why we were talking about, for example, just the interest payment that he had to pay on the debt, being a huge pressure for him. I also think that heading into year end, and this is the reason why there's this real tension, I was looking last night at 4.30 p.m. Eastern at the Fed balance sheet, because that's what I do on Thursdays. And they have actually come down almost $400 billion, more than $300 billion in strength. Since the peak earlier this year, that's just the beginning. It went from $9 trillion. So it's all like M2, that means a tightening financial condition? But yeah, we haven't even seen the bulk of that. To me, that's going to be compelling to see. Can you imagine happy hour with Lisa Abramowitz? Let's look at the Fed balance sheet. Gloom hour. Jim Bianco would love to do that with Lisa. Be helping us here in a moment. Blueberg surveillance on a Friday. So you build a successful company, but you might not want to run it for the next 10, 15, 20 years, or do you? And if you didn't, would you want to go into government? If the president called you to serve our country, would you go into government? Or would you start another company? I love what I do. And I feel like I have this luxury with 23 me that it keeps evolving. We started out just as a start out consumer company. We're thick in research. We got into drug discovery in 2015, and now we're getting to the delivery of care. So I've been really lucky with 23 me that it's been endlessly interesting. And I'm surrounded by incredibly talented, brilliant individuals where I learned from them. And what I always advise people to do is you should take jobs where you're learning. And if you stop learning in a job, then you should quit. And frankly, when people leave 23 me, I say, if you're not learning anymore, you should move on. So I'm 100% committed to 23 me. That said, my other passion is other direct to consumer. Like, I want to build out a true consumer empowered healthcare world, one that is outside of the existing system.

We will never break, we will never break. Build all our foundation strong enough to stay. We will never, no, we will never, no. Multi-trillion dollar industry. There's a lot of ground to cover. Come on, these got absolutely crushed. We'll show you what's happening in ETFs like no one else. Bloomberg ETF IQ Monday on Bloomberg. The top names in climate change are on Bloomberg. Building out local wind, local solar, hydrogen, these are solutions to not just climate issues but geopolitical issues. We are in a position by 2030 to 80% of all electricity generated by wind. Newables are the safest, the cleanest and the cheapest form of energy today especially for countries such as Greece. Nobody covers climate change like Bloomberg. Your global business authority. There's no doubt about it. That inflation, inflation, inflation is the key to market direction. Eventually we're going to see a more significant pullback in risk assets and equities. Right now it's a market that's trading on whether inflation is coming in better or worse relative to expectations. The Federal Reserve Fund rate is going to go above 5% up to 5% on a quarter. This narrative of now pivot to pause is one that is just not yet backed by the Fed. This is Bloomberg's surveillance with Tom Keane, Jonathan Farrow and Lisa Abramowitz. Is this bear market rally already exhausted itself from New York City for audience worldwide at Tom Keane, Jonathan Farrow, Lisa Abramowitz, John Farrow is off today. And yes, I am leading with Bloom because right now we are looking at a tape that is a little bit optimistic and yet note after note is just full of a slope. Every single one saying that basically it's running out of steam and we'll ask. I'm not going to go every single one. I don't know what Binky Chad is doing over Deutsche Bank but you're absolutely right. The zeitgeist into the Friday weekend reading through the weekend framing out for 2023 as well as me don't buy this rally. Basically pretty much across the board with a few exceptions. The key issue here is that the central bankers are basically confirming that. They're coming out one after another. We've gotten a talk from the Federal Reserve. We're getting talked from ECB president Christine Lagarde and they all are saying the same thing. We are going to tighten to restrictive. We are not there yet and we're not going to necessarily stop just because of pain. But let's frame this out with Jim Bianco coming up a really important conversation. Dominic Consum at Mizzouo says there's a risk here that they're already super restrictive and this goes to your world Lisa without making a joke about it. We look at the Tuesdays and version in adults like you are looking at the three month 10s new inversion which finally signals the restriction Dr. Consum's talking about. And we can get into that with our upcoming guest in Bianco. When you look beyond that though to the people who don't necessarily see gloom there are a few of them including Torsten Slock over at Apollo saying the soft landing idea could be coming back to the floor because inflation is rolling over right. We are seeing signs of that. It's just such a motley picture especially as we see. I mean if you think about the retail earnings we've gotten some good some bad consumers are pulling back but they're still spending. How do you get some sort of sense of where we're heading and I think that's what you feel in these notes. Look at that 70 basis points. For those of radio we just put up the banner on television 70 negative 70 basis points 7 tens of a percentage point difference between two year and the 10 year. I'm stunning. What I would say Lisa and I've always gotten in trouble with this in the wonderful Alan Melz who took my add-off ones on this. Can you aggregate America into a blended aggregated.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,538,2022-11-18 13:04:14
17925," And I've always gotten in trouble with this. And the wonderful Alan Meltzer took my add-off once on this. Can you aggregate America into a blended aggregated recession, like maybe what NBER tries to do? Or can we say on this Friday morning, parts of America are in substantial recession? That's absolutely fair. And how much is that clouding? Some of the data that we're getting also just want to tell you this. You're seeing retail shares in general do really well because footlacker and gap and a number of others have really performed particularly well. We are seeing a bit of a lift overall though, in general. Let me start with the data you pick it up. Lisa Brent crude under $90 a barrel at $88.13. We're going to get a 79 on West Texas Intermediate. That I guess is Pacific Rim, China. Maybe they're not going to come back. Well, Rita's son was basically saying she doesn't get any signal from the noise that is the trading and the oil market right now because of half financialized today. As I'm looking at yields, they're kind of, I'll use your word, Nudgey, you're seeing a bit of an increase in the 10 year yield right now looking at 3.79%. But a bigger increase when you look at the short end and that I think has been the theme and confirming your view of that yield curve inversion. Right now when we talk about yields, we talk about inversion and we talk about the tea leaves to watch. There's no one who I'd rather speak to than Jim Bianco, founder and president of Bianco Research. Jim, do you buy that we can see more with this bear market rally? Or is it basically on its last legs? No, the rally could continue. I do think it is a bear market rally. I mean, you know, it could go to the end of the year. But I don't think necessarily that October 10th was the low. And part of the reason is what has been the hope of every rally we've had this year, the Fed's going to pause. They're going to pivot. They're going to step down. We've got peak inflation. It's all the same thing. And Chairman Palsman fairly consistent. Every time the market gets itself excited, he comes out and gives an eight minute speech. And he says, no, I'm not. And then that ends the rally. And I fear that that is eventually going to come with this one too. And that's the reason why people have been so focused on the yield curve because that's telling that story that the Fed is going to keep going, even as people's belief in longer term growth, keeps contraction, keeps coming down. So at what point do you see the signal from perhaps some signs of a softening in CPI that perhaps the Fed has been fully priced in to a market that's not so bad? Well, I don't think we've got the signal yet. You're right about the yield curve. It is the 10 year, three month curve is the one that all economists look at, the 10 year, two year curve is what the market looks at. But that economist curve only inverted in the last week or so. And it's saying to us that only in the last week or so is the Fed beginning to get too tight. Everything they've done up till now has not been. And that doesn't mean the Fed has to immediately pause. The Fed, the market could stay this way for several months before it turns around. The question becomes about inflation. I still think the question about is inflation peaked, misplaced? Yeah, it probably has. The better question is, is it going to 2% or is it going to stop it for? Because if it stops a four, then the Fed has not been too aggressive. It's going to go to two, it has been. And I'm in the camp, it's going to stop somewhere around four, three and a half. And that's the real problem, not that we've peaked, but that we're not on our way back to 2%. Jim, that's right. I mentioned this in the last hour of the hour before. But the bottom line, Jim Bianco, is all of a sudden the jobs report of December, first we could December 2. All of a sudden becomes a lot more important than it was a week ago. Are we going to see a jump in unemployment rate in December? Or do we got to wait for the first week of January? Well, so far this year, the story has always been. There's going to be a jump in the unemployment rate. And yet we never get it. We produced 260,000 jobs last month. We produced 4 million jobs this year. And initial claims are still in the low 200,000s. So for everybody that wants to see, I mean wants because they want to rally, they want to see softening in the labor market so that the Fed would pivot or pause. They haven't gotten it yet. And whether or not we're going to see that in the first week of December remains to be seen. But so far this year, it is constantly, the employment report is constantly been stronger that everybody expects. But do you think that's going to break? I mean, our listeners, our viewers are seeing the daily gloom of 10,000 here, freezes here, whatever, on and on and on. Is there?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,539,2022-11-18 13:08:38
17926," facts. But do you think that's going to break? I mean, our listeners, our viewers are seeing the daily gloom of 10,000 here, freezes here, whatever, on and on and on. Is there a shift now, Jim, to where finally employment matters? Well, employment does matter. And whether or not we're going to see that shift, you're right. Everybody focuses on layoffs and people losing their job, but what doesn't make the press is people making getting jobs. And like I said, we've produced four million more jobs this year already. And that is going to be a prerequisite, I think, a weakening labor market to begin the discussion about whether or not the Fed is going to pause. And so far, that has not happened. And I don't think it's going to happen in two weeks when we get the next payroll report. Jim, I want to finish where we begin. You originally said, you don't necessarily see us getting back down to 2% in terms of inflation and that rates are not necessarily going to come back down to where they have been, even a 2% kind of level. So where do you see us leveling out? I mean, how persistent is this concern, especially as you have the likes of Jim Bullard, putting 7% rates as a potential possibility out there? I think that the inflation level can be very persistent because I've been one that is argued we're in an apostat pandemic economy. That's not like the pre-pandemic economy. And that things have changed, especially in the labor market, in globalization and in energy. It's going to keep inflation high for several years. And that means we're in a new regime with interest rates. That where we are right now, a 4% interest rates might only be neutral. And maybe Jim Bullard is right. And that's what we have to start thinking about. That restrictive, sufficiently restrictive to use his phrase might be closer to 5 or 6 or 7% as opposed to thinking that rates are too high right now. Jim Bianco, thank you so much. Greatly, greatly appreciated this morning here on Fed Dynamics and the mystery going forward. We got all these other Friday stories, Bitcoin and crypto and Twitter. Thank you, Mandi Psiang. Taylor Swift update. Thank you, Tom. He priced out $34,000 for a ticket. Was it two days ago? Yeah. There we are. Section 5, row 16, you and me, Houston, sometime in April with Phoebe Bridgers and Gail, $4,050. We've come in a bit from $34,000 to $4,000. Is this trying to make better conversation at Thanksgiving with the family? Hey, I got everyone Taylor Swift tickets. This is only two. Well, yeah, please, that's not going to happen. There's only two things in Washington, they agree on. They all ate China. And they're all going after ticket master, obviously. And I really don't understand it. I mean, we really haven't read into it, but Mrs. Swift with her claim has got the politicians railed up. We've all lived it. We've gone to different sporting events. And you can see that all the seats are empty because their corporate boxes and nobody else can buy them except that they mean we they're sold to the secondary market. They get priced up dramatically. And you know, this is a question. How do you democratize the process of selling the initial batch if demand so far as to buy a testament to Taylor Swift and what she's done here in and out of the picture. Really? You're going to comment on Taylor Swift. I'm sorry. You're going to talk about your love for Taylor Swift. Oh, she's, you know, she's piercing. I love champagne. I think it's just a great song. Where are we here? I'm going to talk oil and read a sentence. Can we go back? Because that is on this Friday with the other, the inversion when Jim Bianco talked about the distinctive thing to me of worry of slowdown is Brent crude 97 to 88 in 12 cups of coffee. I asked her why have the bulls been wrong? Why haven't we seen the most extreme cases? And she said, you know, there's a lot of financializations. You don't want to get too technical, but there's a lot of technical kinds of aspects of this. I just don't understand, you know, the narrative could be one way or another. You either have a global slowdown causing prices to go way down or you have a shortfall of just the potential production causing prices to go way up, especially with a China opening. I can't really create a narrative from oil right now. I just can't. I mean, it's sort of trading in tandem with other risk assets it seems like.

Thank you all, presentation has been facilitated by hablandoors Tum press at the museum of experience presentation. Now,1 on Christmas Eve, also mindsing their images from otherubbers who received their BAT as presents. Children who might have received the award they receive from their nurses here, they'll greatly appreciate great contributions, I'm going to name a couple of your babies. I don't know if I'm asking you to choose amongst your children, but you know some of the most recognizable buildings by you of course the Millennium Bridge, London City Hall, the Reichstag and the Great Court British Museum. What was your favorite project to do? The Reichstag does stand out because first of all it's an energy manifesto. So, so it transformed something that was dependent on fossil fuels, it uses all the technology to produce something which is essentially carbon neutral and there's a public building, that's a statement. It's a symbol of a city, a symbol of a nation, it incorporates works of art, it's recycling and existing building which as I mentioned earlier is the ultimate in sustainability if you can if you can give a new life to a building. It also creates public space at the roof level, it's the most visited parliament in the world so it puts the public above the politicians who are answerable to them and that of course was made possible by the politicians so it's it's a demonstration of democracy in action.

I mean it's it's frankly too bad because John is far more knowledgeable of this. But for the gentleman from BMP Parable we're going to get right into it with futures up 35. Lisa's got actually adult questions. Forget about it. Explain the joy in 2018 when France pulled this incredibly difficult feet off. What was it like for all of the BMP Parable family to see France do this four years ago? Well Tom thank you for having me by the way. Lisa as well.

Then with a lot of expectations for this upcoming World Cup. Viva Le Blu. Right. It's always complex to be the defending.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,541,2022-11-18 13:20:12
17928," coming World Cup, Viva Leblue, right? It's always complex to be the defending country to do everything. Exactly. And today in this soccer landscape, there is no small team anymore. Francis Leblade, Denmark, where it's in Asia, there's Australia, and you just never know. I will keep an eye. I have the privilege of being French in America, and then I have two teams to support. And because of John, he's not here with us today, but I will keep an eye on England. I promise. I went to John and I said, it gave me a smart question to this. John, even, and he said, ask about a 36 year old Olivier is getting a little old. How old an older French team do in the heat in Doha? Well, it's a combination. You know, the World Cup is a long journey. It's a one-month competition, and you're right. It's a combination of youth, energy, but experience. And I think this French team is pretty what equate on both fronts. So you said that you're both a US, as well as French, and you can vote for both teams. You can vote for both teams. As the US arm of the biggest European bank, how much is your main company diverting money to you because it is so much stronger here in the US? Well, this economy is still the most resilient economy in the world. If we look at the status today, in terms of tight labor market, in terms of status of corporate balance sheets, households are still spending, and the capital markets are still functioning, and our US bank here has been benefiting from this. Having said that, our economists are predicting a shallow recession in 2023, because this US economy is still very quiet interconnected with the rest of the world. We expect to rebound in 2024. How much does that affect your willingness to lend? Right? I mean, because if you basically are tasked with trying to support other aspects of the bank, perhaps, that are in other areas that aren't as optimistic, perhaps, as the US, but the US is also in a difficult spot. How do you decide how loose to be with your purse? You risk management is critical. You have to be quite selective with the sectors you cover, with the clients you support. But I have to say, if I look at my client needs today, it's around three dimensions, lending. You're right. Even the most frequent issuers in high grade, because of the higher cost of funding, they're either way, and we're actually bridging significant number of capital market transactions to optimize their capital raising. Hold on one second. So this is really important. In other words, you're taking it on your books. Basically, you're saying you'll lend at a lower rate than the market rate to have them wait until rates are lower. It's a combination of lower rates or making sure they can pick the right window. High rate is remain open, but you have to pick your windows if you want to optimize your capital raising. So second important need I see from clients today is risk management and hedging strategies. And it's really across rates and commodities and currencies and equities. I took a cup of coffee and Beijing decades ago with the senior officer of BMP Paraba with the decades of French experience in China. Give us your perspective, and how China is going to extricate itself from this mess. Well, it's definitely not a country that we have a lot of connection with the bank as presents there. Oh, you're understated. Come on, the bank is huge traditional presents there. And still, if you expect this economy in 20-23 to go through a shadow recession, the eurozone is already in recession. You still see today China providing some growth to the global economy, which we expect to be for 2022, around 2%. And it's a downturn. In China, a lot of it would be around getting 40 out of the pandemic and obviously expecting some more stability there. The heritage of your shop is a wonderful reticence to speak about economic boom. Your economist, Karl Riccadano, we've got a 90-and-a-quaint. So thank you, sir, for stealing him from Bolberg. We love it, by the way. We'll never forgive you. But Mr. Riccadano and back to Dr. Cornado have been dead on about GDP. What does he say in this titanic battle we're having on recession? Karl, by the way, it's my only way to really continue to be part of the Bloomberg family to have Karl undead. We'll work on it. And we love it. Thank you for that.

17929," To really continue to be part of the Bloomberg family, to have a card on that side. That's right. And we love it. Thank you for that. I've been training for so many years. Carl is saying in 2023 a shallow recession as we just discussed, you know, minus 1%. But it's very confident that in 2024, he sees this rebound because of the good foundations of the resiliency of this economy and back to a more normalized GDP growth around, you know, 2%. How concerned you as you are you as you look at some of the risk management you were talking about earlier as you decide how much to lend. How do you factor in exogenous events? How do you factor in a colder winter? How do you focus in? How do you fold in the prospect of a Federal Reserve that potentially could go well beyond with people currently are. I wish we had all the answers to your wonderful question. Correct. So how do you model it out? I, I, I, I, what definitely is worrying out, but you know, the way it's pretty works in the real life. It's really about the sectors, about the clients. And honestly, about the management you deal with because a big part of managing a company is between the hands of the leaders. You know, you, you mentioned inflation, you mentioned energy. If I look back to comparison between Europe and US, I think Europe has two main challenges in the, in the months to come. It's obviously inflation and the ECB is going exactly in the same direction as the Fed. You know, they're going to be okay, they're doing the job. And the second one is energy. And on the energy side, you start seeing with the good news is for 2022 for the winter 2022, 2023. I think the eurozone has managed to, you know, to, to, to navigate through this energy crisis. And I think the second trend, and I can see this happening already there, it will happen here eventually. You see a real commitment to diversify sources of energy. The new bone, hydrogen, solder, wind, hydro when it works, but I think the China's left the station on this front. And in Europe, there is a probably very favorable regulatory and fiscal environment to support this trend toward ISG and sustainability. Johnny Philly, thank you so much for joining us here.

And then we've got all these other stories, which is a number one in front of you. It's limping into a holiday season with a great degree of uncertainty. I mean, there are all of these stories, whether Twitter becomes a main story, whether it becomes a side story, it is a specific story. There are also the other stories out there of Bitcoin and crypto assets and what's going to happen there. But the bigger story is central bankers seem determined to raise rates dramatically. And you have a lot of fear of what that's going to do to an economy. And people deeply uncertain about how to proceed. And the common Bramble King ground folks is the American housing market. We will get data on that today here, which will be interesting to say the least. But a lot of smart people are doing this ex shelter, this ex rents. I mean, that's where we are. The back and forth between whether or not we see a huge disinflationary force coming in next year is really interesting. And it really decipheres distinguishes the bills from the bears.

And we have the ****.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,544,2022-11-18 13:33:39
17931," game in California. The book is I'm still standing out. Bill Gross, in your note to us, you take sharp exception of the financialization of the system and that Jerome Powell is dealing with much more leverage than Paul Voker dealt with. What is the major risk for the chairman of the Fed? I'm not going to do that. Tommy, you're coming through broken here. Maybe we can take a pause. I can't hear you for a while. You're broken. Okay. What we're going to do is work on the technicals right now with Mr. Gross here. Some problems getting out to him. That happens from time to time. But Lisa, this is a really important discussion and the distinction that Bill Gross does is and you and I saw this. I say more a year ago than now is this idea of everyone not to blame Powell looking back to the giant Paul Voker. All my radars up when we do that. Well, are we in the same kind of 1970s era? You say no. Other people are saying that's the risk that the Fed is trying to avoid, which is why they're going to raise rates and keep them there for longer. I keep seeing all of the notes that are coming out for next year and the one uniting feature of almost all of them, they like bonds. They like longer duration. David Bail and it's city group was here. Yes, they like 10-year treasuries. Are we setting up? And I do think one of the key questions into 2023 is, are we setting up for another bond bull market, unlike what we have seen in recent eras because we have seen yield built up and then is it taken away with this belief that we are going to see some sort of recession and go back to some kind of normal that we need to. We'll see what we can do with Bill Gross here. I've had the privilege of standing with him in Muhammad al-Ary in generations, ago at Pimpco, looking down at Bill Gross's Monroe Trader, which was the calculator before a Bloomberg terminal. And a guy like Gross remembers getting blown up in 1978 and the one thing not talked about here in year world is the bond markets have been blown up now, not by Powell, but the price down yielded at movie scenes unprecedented. This is because of deflation, right? And when you talk about the bond market, you're talking sovereign bonds because yes, you have seen losses in the corporate space, but not akin to what people have previously expected. Again, are we there yet? Is the big question. Are we there in terms of how high yields have to go to slow inflation? We don't know because we don't even understand the inflation that we're dealing with, which is the reason why people are parsing beneath the headlines as you really rightly pointed out without housing, without some of these other energy and food inputs. And they're saying, wait a second, we're seeing a big disinflation, but are we? Is it a major shout out to Pimpco, the Pacific Investment Management Company that Mr. Gross basically invented. And as they've moved along, they made a spectacular call two years ago to short and duration. And when Jerome Schneider was with us, it was amazing. They're in decision after their huge house call about what do you do now? Yeah, Bill Gross coming into let this year said he doesn't think that treasuries are anything that they're garbage. And he was right. I mean, it's been the worst route that we've seen in a very long time, perhaps ever according to certain denominations. But at what point does that set us up for a good year next year versus just set us up for something that's more of the same. And that's the reason why yesterday Jim Bullard coming out the 5 to 7%. I agree. In the market moves right on on a dime was a complete game changer if that were to come to fruition, but they don't understand the inflation just like everybody else. I look at the Fed speak and let's review this today. Closin out of the Netherlands out moments ago with headlines. We spoke to him in Washington here a number of weeks ago, but folks, I want to get out front and again beneath the zeitgeist is Catherine Mann. And it's basically and I wish the Fed did this. They bring in a token foreigner to help out the Bank of England. Others have done that. Adam Posein has done that now at the Peterson Institute. And here's Dr. Mann with her city group work, her work at Brandeis over the years and iconic work on international trade. And it's going to be really interesting to see what the Uber Hawk man says about what now for governor Bailey in the Bank of England. This is their worst case scenario, right? I mean, stiflation is the worst case scenario for central banks. Then add in that there isn't the fiscal response that Washington isn't going to necessarily open the purse strings. You're not going to see that from the ECB. You're not going to see that from European leaders. We're going to pick up with Bill Gross right now if we can. We had some technical difficulties. Bill, we're a p-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,545,2022-11-18 13:37:30
17932," and it necessarily opened the purse strings. You're not gonna see that from the ECB. You're not gonna see that from European leaders. We're gonna pick up with Bill Gross right now if we can. We had some technical difficulties. Bill, we apologize for that. Bill, what is your prescription for the Fed? What should the Fed do is they try to manipulate their ways through 75 and indeed 50 basis point increases as well. Well, we've had technical difficulties with Bill Gross. I'm going down to flames here today. And they're raising, this is not the control room. They arrive sober. I didn't. So it's my fault we're not speaking to Mr. Gross this morning. So what we're gonna do, I hope, is talk to Michael McKee. Michael McKee, you know, has had a really tough job here looking at the economic data. And as I've mentioned twice on the show this morning, I think the basic idea here is what do you do about a jobs report? Lisa, I'm gonna state flat out that the jobs report has become important the first week of December. How quickly does it soften? How quickly do you see an employee to a really rise, which is exactly what the Fed has been saying they want to see this sort of perversity of desiring some sort of downturn in order to combat inflation, which is seen as the bigger problem. We went out and we tried to find among the 19,000 employees of Bloomberg, someone dumber than us on the World Cup and not as good as John Farrow. That would be Michael McKee. We're having fun with us today. Yeah, it sounds harder. It's going well. I said, well, I'm sure you're fault we couldn't talk to Bill Gross. Probably. He pulled the plug. To me, the funniest tweet that today was Ed Marie Horder and over, she's in Bali and she's following the World Cup and she tweets, yeah, but you can still get Bud Zero. Yeah. I mean, that's kind of the most important thing that's something to do with your head. That's the most important thing in the culture and the social of the moment. You can get at the shift I see, Michael McKee, from bullet 7% is all of a sudden the jobs report in December is important. When do they do that jobs report, the two reports, the establishment and the larger survey, when do they actually count the bodies? It's based on the payroll period that includes the 12th of the month. And different companies pay different ways. Like if you get paid monthly, you're going to be in there in the 12th of the month. But if you're paid weekly or biweekly or even on a day rate, it's that week. So we've just had that. And that was what the jobless claims yesterday were reflecting the payroll week for November. And the fact that they went down probably some good news. The household survey goes on basically all month because it's a telephone survey of people. It used to be. It used to be more in person. What are they saying? Are you employing it? Yes, literally. They literally say that. This is John's big sort of issue with some of the sentiment surveys. He's like, who do they call? They call 500 people. They're like, I'm feeling like inflation might be 1.3% in 1965. I am curious. I mean, I think it's a lot more accurate than I give a little bit more credence to it. When it comes to the employment picture, I've read a number of stories, a number of analysts reports talking about how tech is not the rest of the employment market. And actually, companies are hanging on to employees for as long as they can. And then you see reports about other companies, potentially even Disney, having some cutbacks, other companies outside in the entertainment space. Is this how it begins? Or is this going to be a stickier kind of picture with tech as the main outlier? Well, I think both of those thoughts are correct. It's how it begins as companies see demand start to slow. But we haven't seen really demand at Disney parks start to slow. So we'll have to wait and see how they do that. In the tech sector, it seems to be a story of overgrowth. Too many people hired. And so they're rationalizing their employees. But Lisa, you're right. It was so hard for people to find workers. And that I think targets the perfect examples. Like we're going to do a $3 billion re-structuring. Without job dynamics. But we're not going to cut jobs. You would have never seen that. No, it's this very unusual situation because it's all post pandemic. And we've, well, 100 years since we had one. We got something out of Bill Gross. He says the 49ers will beat the Cardinals on Monday. Thank you. Glad to be in this. The important stuff. People difficulties. Thank you, Bill Gross, for that nugget. Thank you, Michael McKee, so much for coming here. I actually am very curious to catch up with you as we get some of the housing data as well. And try to spin it forward.

I'm Lisa Mateo. This is Bloomberg The So is there more pressure when you're trying to win a basketball championship then when you're trying to please investors. Where's the greater pressure? Oh, I think it's definitely trying to win a championship.

17934," pressure. Oh, I think I think it's definitely trying to win a championship. It's hard because a lot of like when you invest and you know this when you're investing you can control a lot more things when you know in a basketball court you can't control whether somebody's gonna make a shot you've got to get lucky. And what's the greater pleasure making five times your money on a distressed debt investment or winning the NBA championship? They're both fabulous. I wish I could do one each year that would be great but I think it was a great feeling in being right on an investment that you've done a tremendous amount of work and you've made money for your clients which I think is great. I think winning a championship is it's a very surreal feeling because there's a whole city or state that is actually behind you. You know we had 70,000 people at the finals and we had them all outside. 17,000 in stands and then literally like 60,000 people outside and when we won like just the joy that you had brought to the city was phenomenal. When I started I had no idea it was going to turn into this just a trix new empire. I don't have any investors. All this is all money in. This is me going out in Hustlin bringing that money back and just building it, building it, building it. You gotta think about a person that was homeless at one point. Didn't really have any money coming in. The fact that this person was relentless and just determined to succeed and not let rock bottom define him as an individual. I can take things and put them together and take them apart and make them better and put them back together. I respect the craft so I don't want to minimize and disrespect the value of each step of the craft and do by machine what should be done by hand. We're in the early stages of a sustainability revolution that has the magnitude of the industrial revolution coupled with the speed of the digital revolution. Nobody covers climate change like Bloomberg your global business authority. At this stage I would say that the two-year yield reflects monetary policy expectations in the very short term but the 10 and 30-year rates that's the market simply moving on to what's next and what's next is going to be a pre-significant economic slowdown. So the inversion is simply a tale of two different curves. The spirit of Bloomberg surveillance on very short notice. Think of the Sikorsky in the surveillance helicopter for bringing in any and Lincoln yesterday of Bimo Capital markets on the stunning curve inversion. Now more inversion than we spoke with Mr. Lincoln yesterday. 70 basis points for global Wall Street. That's a huge huge statistic. The response yesterday was jaw-dropping. Griefeld with more tweets and Taylor Swift. It was just unbelievable to see her. For those of you on radio wearing black again and morning for Bitcoin in her world Katie Griefeld joins us here on crypto. What do I look for this morning? What's the thing that matters right now in this saga? The thing that matters right now is we're expecting from FTX's lawyers to get a list of the 50 biggest credit. Domino's pizza pizza take out 5 p.m. It could be anything because we know there's more than a million creditors here. Are you serious? I'm serious. That was a headline on the terminal. Who are they like the 20 biggest that we know? I mean are the Winkle Vi are they creditors? I would imagine so and you think about how many people use this exchange? It was the second biggest exchange in the world for crypto by spot volume. So you have that all together. That is a lot of people potentially holding a bag here.

17935," world for crypto by spot volume. So you have that all together. That is a lot of people potentially holding a bag here. Will there be, I mean, the stock is the stock. Listen to me. The coin, as she calls it, is stabilized up $200, $16,700 is well. Can there be news flow today and into Saturday of these tangential stories like Genesis? Absolutely. And that's what we're on the watch for. The crypto team will be working all weekend in terms of Bitcoin. Bitcoin will also be working all weekend. It never stops trading. But what you're seeing today, the fact that the coin is up, that just goes to show that this is a macro asset that we're talking about right now. Bitcoin is somewhat unaffected somehow by all these huge. I hear from everybody that's dead set against a scam. Their words. How does Bitcoin state elevated given all this tension? Matt Miller would compare it to Lehman and the dollar after Lehman blew up the US dollar. It didn't break ultimately. So that's the sort of tradify comparison that I can tell me FTX and Genesis is not linked to Bitcoin. I'm telling you that there's still hardcore believers who are using this as a sort of validated moment saying that the Bitcoin technology, the Bitcoin blockchain, this still works. It's when you're talking about these very centralized crypto companies that go against the underlying ethos of the space. That's when trouble starts. Those fancy words like ethos folks. Let me get back to the real world. The venerable A-Screenberg of Bear Stearns made a market with a paper buy ticket in his left pocket and a paper sell ticket in his right pocket. Do you believe that this quote unquote market into the weekend is a valid market or are we trying to report out manipulation? I mean, this is the case always when we're talking about weekend markets in crypto. There's not a lot of liquidity. Again, we talk about how this is a 24-7 asset class if you want to call it that. But there's, I mean, it's so hard to make too much of the price moves over the weekend. The people who are trading, it's not necessarily the big guys. Yeah, but the big guys, don't they say at one point I need to cut and run? They don't call Goldman Sachs up and say, I got 400,000 shares. Can you work it out or four million shares? Can I work it out? If somebody wants to unload, who's got a lot of this coin? If they've got this coin, how do they actually unload said coin? Well, right now what's interesting is you're seeing a lot of money actually come to decentralized exchanges. That is a thing that exists. The lights of FTX, Binance, Coinbase. Those are all centralized exchanges that have some role. Are they in the United States? Binance? No. Coinbase. FTX? Yes. FTX? No, but they did file. Everybody wants regulators to the rescue. What is the SEC supposed to do about Abercadaire? Ali Bava and Cayman Islands or FTX off on another island? What are the regulators do about that? That's what regulators have been grappling with for really the past two to three years. I agree. For a while they were trying to do that. We agree on something. We do agree. We do agree. But it's an open question what they can do. They're trying to figure that out right now, which of the letters of the regulators actually regulate this asset class. We know that next month we're going to get House and Senate hearings on the FTX collapse. They're hoping that SBF himself will be there. But again, what is their sort of purview here? What can they do? What else do we look for? I mean, into Friday and frankly, to Monday. I mean, I look at Bitcoin on Saturday, Sunday. I've just fascinated it's open 24, seven as well. Is you develop out a story away from FTX? Which party will you look for? Again, all eyes on Genesis. Really? That does the dominance. I'm really interested to see what happens to Genesis. So what's Mr. Silver doing this morning besides watching? He's not talking. Barry, come on. We'd love to talk to you. He's not talking to me. I will tell you that. I'm not sure. I mean, I imagine that they're again talking to the advisors that they hired for Genesis. And probably thinking about other parts of the empire. Again, gray scale is their digital asset manager. They look relatively unscathed here. But doesn't Genesis in Connecticut as a general statement have people financially distressed right now? Or is it a margin call that they face today? Or what's the proper language there? The proper language.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,549,2022-11-18 13:55:03
17936," and have people financially distressed right now, or is it a margin call that they face today, or what's the proper language there? The proper language is that they've halted withdrawals. If you have money tied up with Genesis, you were using Genesis as a lender. You can't withdraw what? You can't withdraw your coins. You can't withdraw your assets right now. My 1909 SVDB Lincoln can. Exactly, exactly. What? Is Bitcoin a coin? Bitcoin is a coin in the broad sense. It's the biggest cryptocurrency out there. Again, what actually is a coin? Is it a medium of exchange that's up for debate? I feel like we've kind of debunked that. We've also maybe debunked the Haven aspects of it. The inflation had aspects of it. So I mean, it's a reckoning that it's going through right now. How do you define this? Is it a currency? It's many people would argue that it is in distressed situations if you're trying to be like. Is it a Bobway? You know, bits in Bobway. I mean, is that what we got here? It's legal tender in El Salvador. I'll tell you that. Okay, well great. El Salvador, I've never been there. One of my interns has been there. Okay. Yeah, but El Salvador, are you kidding me? Yeah. You're telling me that I'm supposed to have a validation of this coin because of El Salvador? Many people were making the case when that announcement happens. When I say many people, I mean, the hardcore crypto believers who, again, they're not doing too hot right now. Is Barry Silver a hardcore crypto believer? He's been in the space for since the beginning almost. I mean, the man bought his first Bitcoin around 2012, 2013 when it was... So he's profitable now at 16,000? Yes, I was going back in the archives. I was reading Fortune pieces. He bought it around $7 per coin. So think about where we are. $16,000. That's a pretty good. I'm going to go back to my first term. Is it a currency? It's a question I've been... I'm Bloomberg folks. You go XBT and the yellow key on the Bloomberg is currency. Which is the correct yellow key? By that classification, it is. According to the Bloomberg terminal, it's a currency. But whether I could go out and go to an ATM and then buy a pizza with it, I mean, we know by now that that's not quite an easy process. You don't know what a link in 1909 SVDB is to you? I wish I did. My mother threw my coin collection out. Katie Griefeld, I'm smarter with your attendance on crypto. An extraordinary day. Stay with us on radio. I'm going to go back to my first term. Somebody is watching and says, I want to be a real man when I grow up. What should somebody do to get into the talent agency business or the business you're in? Well, it's hopefully what I've taught my kids. You've got to be intellectually curious. You've got to be... You've got to show up. And you know this like I know this. I got on a lot of plans. You just... Even though that voice in your head is saying, oh god, I'm so tired, I don't want to do this. You've got to show up. You've got to be charmingly relentless. You have to build emotional endurance.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,550,2022-11-18 13:59:19
17937," I'm so tired, I don't want to do this. You got to show up. You got to be charmingly relentless. You have to build emotional endurance, because there's no straight line of success at the kind of all over place, and you have to just be able to work through those things. And then I think one of the things that I do every week is I try to create serendipity. We will ever break, we will ever break. Build all our foundation strong enough to stay. We will never, never, we will ever, never. A multi-trillion dollar industry. There's a lot of ground to cover. Come on, these got absolutely crushed. We'll show you what's happening in ETFs like no one else. Bloomberg ETF IQ Monday on Bloomberg. The top names in climate change are on Bloomberg. Building out local wind, local solar, hydrogen, these are solutions to not just climate issues, but geopolitical issues. We are in a position by 20, 30 to 80% of all electricity generated by wind. Reables are the safest, the cleanest, and the cheapest form of energy today, especially for countries such as Greece. Nobody covers climate change like Bloomberg, your global business authority. From New York City for our viewers worldwide, I'm Lisa Abrahman with Infergent, Farrow, a bit of a meltdown. Hard to give any narrative to this, because yields are up as well. And the job one and continues the countdown to the open starts right now. Everything you need to get set for the start of US trading. This is Bloomberg, the open with Jonathan Farrow. We begin with the biggest shoe, a higher bar for the bear market rally. This recent bear market rally is much as we belong to think that this bear market is over. It's going to remain volatile. The release of the CPI report. Everyone's been looking for this. You can see the jubilation. This rally makes a lot of sense. The rally can certainly continue in the short run at least up to 4,100. 4,000 to 4,150 was the range we targeted at the S&P 500. What we can do is we can take advantage of some strategic positioning. There's still headwinds on earnings, still headwinds from valuations. It's still a bear market, so it can rip you apart. Once we get up to 4,100, we think that's where things start to get more challenging. We have to be tactical and overlooking. And then it's a question of where do you go from there? What does that to wait and see how it goes? A lot of bearishness. And yet the market's up yet again. Joining us now to discuss and explain what their view is. Sok Jen's, Subajara Japa and Morgan Stanley's, Jim Caron, Subajara from your perspective, we keep hearing fed officials jaw-boning down this market. Is there essentially a cap that they're trying to put on how high these stocks can go? Yeah, absolutely. I mean, you get into this vicious cycle where if the Fed starts to pull back, or if you get strong data, CPI, 10, it was a little bit lower than expected, anytime you see an inflection point in the data, you're seeing the sort of rally in risky assets. You're seeing financial conditions start to ease. We're seeing mortgage rates come off quite meaningfully in the last week or so. So under these circumstances, you tend to see risk taking coming back to the market. So what the message is from the Fed is that they're steady. They want to stay the course on rate hikes. They want to keep policy tight for the remainder of next year. Until inflation starts to come down. So they've been steadfastly holding on to that sort of messaging on inflation as well as making sure that we don't get into this vicious cycle where financial conditions ease very quickly than they're going to have to do.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,551,2022-11-18 14:03:35
17938," on inflation as well as, you know, making sure that we don't get into this vicious cycle where financial conditions ease very quickly, and then they're going to have to do more by way of heights to curb the inflationary pressures in the market. Jim, do you buy into this bear market rally at all? Are you basically saying this is just a matter of time and it feels very technical? Yeah, well thank you for having me on your show and I follow Subar does work very closely and and she does very good work and I think she nailed it. Look, it's really about financial conditions. So if I take a step back and I think about is the Fed happy or are they worried about the most recent CPI number showing that inflation has come down? I think they're happy that that's happened, but now to get to the point here, what that had or what that actually created was a significant easing in financial conditions as equity prices rallied quite a bit. The dollar fell and credit for its narrowed. So that is a longer term inflationary when financial conditions ease and that means it's going to undo a lot of the work that the Fed is trying to do to push inflation lower. So what that ultimately tells me is that the Fed is trying to push inflation lower through the financial assets channel. So the fact that equities or riskier assets have started to rally, I would be a little bit worried about that because a rally in these risky assets today is really a bet that the Fed is going to fail in terms of their policy actions. So the rally that we've seen to me seems more like a correct and as Mike Wilson was saying, up to maybe that 44,04150 level as he targets it in the S&P, but ultimately I think that the Fed, this just means that the Fed has more room and they feel emboldened to actually even be more aggressive and high grades. More as long as they have the cushion of financial asset prices to do it because their number one mission is to bring that inflation rate down towards target. As we talk, it sounds complicated, especially for people who are like, well, you know, if the company is doing well, we can buy the stock and it should do better. And people saying actually it has nothing to do with them and has to do with central bank planning, the team at City Blaming the Volatility that we've seen this year, and QT quant consequences. This year's market durations are better explained in terms of central bank liquidity additions and subtractions than in terms of shifts in their language. It is likely to take more than just words to create a durable rally and risk assets. Sabadra, when you talk about how words come out and try to combat a market, we're also looking at the balance, the liquidity aspect. It has come down perhaps close to $400 to $400 billion since the peak earlier this year. How much is that going to be a driving factor in some of the volatility that we see perhaps in the first quarter of next year? Yeah, I mean, there's already been a big driving factor of the volatility in the market over the last, I would say, even beyond over a year now, when Fed started tapering asset purchases last September, you started seeing the liquidity conditions start in deteriorate. And the Fed is going to again continue to run down its balance sheet. We're expecting them to continue to run off their balance sheet well in the next year and beyond because yes, the liquidity conditions have deteriorated, but the market functioning is broadly okay. We are seeing some choppy price action in auctions. You're starting to see some pressure in the bond market from, you know, bond investors stepping away on the demand side of the equation. But broadly speaking, I think that the Fed is going to try to use every channel it can to tie financial conditions. One way to do it is by running off their balance sheet. And this is not just a U.S. phenomenon. Now you have the UK as well as a Europe that are going to start to engage in quantitative tightening. So broadly speaking, I think balance sheets globally are going to start to continue to run off. And that's going to keep some some pressure on bond yields. Jim, from your perspective, how much are you actually just hoarding cash continually, avoiding any potential rallies and just basically hunkering down for something that seems a little bit more clear cut? Yeah, I think that's a good point from an investment perspective. The front end offer is quite a bit of value. So whether we're talking cash, it's just cash or cash in money markets or short term high quality fixed income assets. I think that's a big part of it. I think right now that's actually a very, very good diversifier. You are getting paid nice yields at this point to have that money in cash or cash like equivalent.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,552,2022-11-18 14:08:35
17939," nice yields at this point to have that money in cash or cash like equivalents or cash like instruments. And I think this is a good offset. So when we think about returns and risk adjusted returns, we think that having an overweight towards the front end. So for me, the optimal duration is somewhere around a three or duration poor picks income portfolio. But a lot of that and that's an average level. A lot of that is going to be based in some of the shorter term financial assets, money markets around one and even even two year of maturities. And I'll hedge that a little bit by owning some things a little bit larger. So the average duration gets to about three years. But I think that this is where we need to be right now because there's a lot of uncertainty as to how high the Fed may actually even hike interest rates, you know, probably around the 5% terminal levels, what I think, but that's, but so between now and say the first quarter, I think that's going to be a pretty good diverse fire. I'm glad you mentioned that Jim because what we saw yesterday from the Fed's Jim Bullard of the St. Louis, he really set the tone basically slapping a five handle on his terminal rate outlook. Minneapolis Fed President Yelkeshkari also taking the hawkish queue. We are all united in our commitment to getting inflation back down to our 2% target. It's an open question of how far we are going to have to go with interest rates to bring that demand down into balance. We have raised interest rates a lot this year. So there's a lot of tightening in the pipeline. We have not felt the full effects yet and yet inflation is still very high. Boston Fed President, Susan Collins, the latest poor cold water and any hopes of a dumb shift saying quote, the latest data have not reduced my sense of what sufficiently restrictive may mean. Norm my resolve this will require additional increases in the federal funds rate following followed by a period of holding rates. Bloomberg's Michael McKee joining us now for more basically saying if you guys are reading into that CPI report, don't accept they are. And that's the funny thing. The markets and the Fed don't seem to see eye to eye over the course of 2023. You talked about Jim Bollard yesterday. He sent yields higher, but yet look what really happened. The terminal rate that he is projecting the market pushed it up, but not to even where it was last week. So the market's not really buying the idea that they're going to go much beyond 5% they did move it out to May, but then they think we're going to see cuts and you can see that in the dot plot on the market and we talked about this yesterday. Lisa the market can reprice every day, whereas the Fed does its dot plots every other meeting. So it was September when they said this, but you can see the green line there. That's where the Fed thought in September that we would be in terms of rates and the red line is where the market thinks now we are going to be and the market thinks they're going to come down significantly. Those are overnight index swaps matched against the Fed's path. So the Fed is still trying to push up rates and push up the psychology. You take a look here. My friend Jim Karen mentioning the idea of the Fed failing. And I know you were big on this earlier today, Lisa. This is the three month curve out to 18 months and the J. Powell's favorite curve. He said earlier this year that if it inverts, it means the Fed's going to cut rates. Well, it inverted yesterday. It's come back to about zero this morning, but does that mean the Fed's going to cut rates? Well, I think basically what we're seeing with all these things is that's going to have to do a lot more work to keep the markets on side. Mike, the key great work as always to Badras Japa, Jim Karen, both so with us Jim was mentioning about that terminal rates to Badra. Do you feel like the market is accurately priced terminal rate of 5% by the Federal Reserve followed by rate cuts that the Fed said isn't going to happen next year? Or do you think that the risk really is to the upside? So I agree with the Jim. I think the terminal fed funds rate for now, these looks like it's going to be around 5 percent of five and five and a quarter. But what are you for next year is that once they get to that terminal fed on the right, they're going to keep rates steady for the remainder of 2023. Even if you start seeing cracks appear in some of the data as well as the curve continuing to invert, because of the fact that they want to see inflation start to move down steadily lower, the Fed has 3.1 percent core bank to track that Baummersky pensioned in for next year That still a bomb.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,553,2022-11-18 14:12:33
17940," Fed has 3.1% Core PC, penciled infrastructure. That's still above its 2% target for inflation. So for the most part, I think they're going to move rates to 5 to 5 and a quarter percent. They know that policy works with long and variable labs, lags. So they're probably going to keep policy steady for the remainder of the next year. And then evaluate, if there is a meaningful surround in economy or a recession, then they might think about changing course if they see a trajectory towards lower inflation. Subagitara Japa, Jim Karen, both of you are sticking with us, joining us now with a look at the stocks moving ahead of the opening bell. Here's Abigail, do a little Abby. Hey, Lisa, well, it turns out that there's at least one discretionary item that is immune to inflation sneakers. We have footlocker popping sharply higher on a very strong quarter, much better than expected. They beat estimates plus the holiday outlook much better than feared. But it's not just footlocker. It's so interesting because we have all these conflicting reports out of retailers. The gap also put up a strong quarter sales beat that shows that the clothing retailer perhaps is beginning to see an improvement. Lots of price targets raised on the street. Roth stars stores the discounting retailer up 16.2 percent. They beat third quarter estimates. They raised their full year forecast on the back of sales momentum. Now applied materials going to the technology space. The semi cap equipment company. So basically a tell on the chip industry, they make the machines that make the chips up nearly 4 percent after they forecast sales for the current quarter that topped estimates. It seems that supply chain improvements are helping to offset economics slowdown. And then finally the economics look in that we're seeing. And then finally, Palo, Alto, networks, the cybersecurity company. Lisa, that stock is also sharply higher. They put up a very strong quarter. Lots of metrics right across the board. Importantly, Billings, a look forward beat that stock really sharply higher. Abby, thank you so much. It's showing really the distinction between the halves and the have-nots within the software and tech space rather than just casting them all aside. Coming up, fiscal policy threatening to undermine the central bank fight against deflation. In the short term, the stance of fiscal policy is important. Fiscal policy needs to be temporary, targeted and tailored. That's my trip to see for you. That conversation is still ahead. From New York, this is Bloomberg. We were thinking big from the beginning. I mean, the reason that I was interested in doing this in the first place was a much bigger challenge than making a comfortable shoe or doing something in the fashion industry as a narrow opportunity. We thought that there was a big leadership opportunity. We looked around at an industry where there was 20 billion pairs of sneakers made every single year. And it was 100% made from plastic and the hides from cows. And it was terrible for the environment. And we thought that we could offer something to consumers that was differentiated in the way it feels more comfortable, higher performance. And do that because we use sustainable materials. And in doing so, we could take a really interesting leadership opportunity and grab that and use that to tell a totally different story and compete on a totally different vector than what the rest of the industry were doing. We've got a market that over the past few weeks has made it clear it wants to go higher. We got a little spooked by the idea that geopelittle potential rises.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,554,2022-11-18 14:16:39
17941," MUSIC What a mess this country is in. We've had 12 years of Conservative government, 12 weeks of us at Kiosk. And it is ordinary working people and businesses that are paying the price for that volatility, that chaos that we've seen in recent weeks. Fiscal turmoil across the Atlantic, the UK unveiling a new budget plan amid a gloomier economic forecast. All over the United States, a divided Congress hangs the fate of the US fiscal policy and balance that's bringing the team. Emily Wilkins, down in Washington, Guy Johnson, in London. Emily, I want to start with you. Some leadership changes over in the House. Also questions around the Senate. How much are we looking at a situation where there will not be the fiscal response or the ability to get anything done? I think we're looking at a very real situation of that happening. I mean, at this point, it's not just that you're going to have a divided government where Republicans control the House and Democrats control the Senate and White House, but you also very, very narrow margins to work with in both chambers. And that's going to make it very difficult for party leaders to try and navigate. Keep all of their members on board while being able to actually get things through. Now, we do have to should point out at least that we have seen divided government work before. When COVID happened, we did see both Democrats and Republicans come together past funding. We've seen similar bipartisan support on issues like Ukraine, but certainly, there are really big questions right now on what's going to happen next year when the debt ceiling needs to be raised and Congress needs to have that debate. As well, it's going to happen with just basic bills to fund the government. Is this going to mean a government shutdown? I think those are all things that we're going to be watching for very closely in the next coming year. Guy, you're probably listening to Emily and you listen to the debate over in the U.S. and you think, hold my beer. We'll take a listen to what we're dealing with. I mean, how has the fallout been from the prospect of some fiscal austerity that we heard yesterday paired with the inflationary outlook and discussion from Katharman at the Bank of England today over at that European Confab? In some ways, the fiscal event yesterday, the awesome statement yesterday, Lisa, was designed to reduce the chaos that we're seeing on the fiscal front. But I think you've got to sift through the tea leaves to kind of figure out exactly what is happening here. This is a heavily back-loaded package that was delivered by the U.K. All of the pain is going to come, well, not all of the pain. The bulk of the pain is going to be coming in the second half of the forecast window after the next 2024 election. And actually, the front end is significantly easier on the consumer. And that's going to be a big problem for the Bank of England. So while there is significant pain coming, the bulk of it comes later. The Bank of England potentially, therefore, is going to have to be more restrictive in the way that it approaches things. So I still think that we haven't quite got through the chaos yet. The interplay between monetary and fiscal policy, I think, is yet to completely click. And I think Catherine Mann certainly talking about that. I think, from the Bank of England's point of view, yesterday is going to have an effect. Clearly, their forecasts are going to be wrong over at the Bank of England because they've just put them out before this fiscal event. But nevertheless, I think the Bank of England probably takes the message from yesterday's fiscal event that it is going to have to do more. Great work. Guy Johnson, Emily Wilkins, both of you, thank you so much. Guy Johnson, putting it really well there, talking about how we haven't seen it play out, the interplay of fiscal monetary policy, Sabajra Joppa, Jim Karen, both back with us. Sabajra, when you game out, what's to come? How much do you think about the lack of a fiscal response, even as monetary policy makers really pull back, really become more restrictive? So on the fiscal side, we already have a lot of fiscal spending that was passed, right? The infrastructure deal as well as the inflation reduction act are both going to be looking towards more fiscal spending. You might see the Republicans, Emily was pointing out pull back on some of the expenditures. To me, what really I'm concerned about is the debt ceiling. We have a divided Congress and there is going to be perhaps another showdown that we should be looking towards in the next few months.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,555,2022-11-18 14:21:03
17942," We have a divided Congress and there is going to be perhaps another showdown that we should be looking towards in the next few months on the debt ceiling. So there's definitely a lot of pushback that you're going to see from Republicans on the fiscal spending side, but a lot of the bigger fiscal spending has already been passed. So we'll have to see what else they can do to pull back on spending. Jim, from your perspective, how do you game this out? How do you figure out how to price in the lack of a fiscal response, the potential for there to be some sort of additional policy accident? So I think this is a very important point and context is going to matter here a lot. So let's go back in time here and go to the global financial crisis 2008. We had unconventional monetary policy as a result of that. Then we get the pandemic and then we all of a sudden have unconventional fiscal policy which was really deficit spending, spending out of debt, issuing debt and spending money. Now that interest rates are higher, governments don't have a free ride at this anymore. It costs money to actually deficit spend or spend money out of debt. So what's happening today is there has been a lot of spending. There needs to be a contraction of fiscal policy. That's already happening in the US. Fiscal policy is already tightening just by virtue of the fact that there's less fiscal spending that's going through right now. But the key for us in terms of gaming this out into the future is what kind of fiscal stimulus do we get? And this is really a supply side economics question. Meaning that if we want to control inflation and have higher productivity and better growth, meaning good growth with low inflation, what you need to see is tax policy incentives for catbacks and census for business investment regulatory changes. And then the second actually increase the productive capacity of corporations to make supply meet demand. Right now what monetary policy is doing is just crushing demand to bring down prices. We need to increase supply and bring down prices but also increase growth. And that's a supply side dose of economics. That's what fiscal policy can do. Monetary policy only moves demand. Fiscal policy can change the supply side of the equation. And we have a supply problem whether it's labor supply or good supply or whatever the case may be, we need to address a supply problem with a supply solution. So fiscal policy is going to be very important going forward. Step one though is to rein in at spending. That's what's happening. That's what that's what the UK is doing. That's what the US is doing. The next step, the critical next step is not to do deficit spending with fiscal policy but to do more investment where we get growth but we don't necessarily increase the debt because we have high growth to pay off and raise revenues through taxes and things like that. So this is real quick here. When do you think we can actually look at the economy and say we are no longer seeing the effects of the fiscal stimulus that was passed two years ago and a year ago? So I think it's going to be probably in about another year. Right now we're seeing the tail off of that fiscal spending. Great. The US isn't fiscal contracture right now. I've heard through the fact that we're spending less money now than what we did during the pandemic. So ultimately that there is going to be a rebound to this at some point in the future. But I still think that we're going to be feeling this for probably another 12 to 18 months. Which complicates the issue in terms of really understanding that interplay of the fiscal and the monetary policy. Thank you so much. Subatara Japa, Jim Karen, have a wonderful weekend coming up the morning calls and later cross marks Bob Dole looking for a pause in higher yields to offer some relief. That conversation around the opening pal. This is one back. Most of us don't spend much time thinking about the grid.

17943," Most of us don't spend much time thinking about the grid. The dizzyingly huge system of cables, transformers and outlets that reliably powers our lives. It's an easily ignored, change resistant part of the modern world and that's the way we like it. The grid is going to have to evolve too. We are seeing so many countries and governments announcing high targets when it comes to decarbonisation and being climate neutral. But this is just one side of the coin. It's not enough to simply generate green energy. We also need to make sure that this transmitted and distributed to the end consumers. The grid of the day just isn't equipped for renewables. So a new kind of grid is starting to take shape. The super grid. When innovation strikes, Bloomberg technology is there with the news and analysis unique. Every week day only on Bloomberg. This is countdown to the open and Lisa Abramowitz in for Jonathan Farrell. Take a look at what's going on. You get a little bit of a lift trying to end the week with a full rally for the week up a tenth of a percent on the S&P on the NASDAQ. Up a bit more than 1%, can't explain this by the yield picture because you are seeing sort of a bit of an increase in yields. It's basically meandering around 2-year yield up 4.47% well off the highs that we have been seeing. 10-year yield up just slightly a base point. 3.78% 30% also up all up and you are still getting bearish or hawkish discussions from the Fed. It doesn't seem to be making a difference. Time now for the morning calls. I look at some of the analyst recommendations on Wall Street this morning. Next up, Credit Suisse downgrading HP to neutral expecting margins to remain pressured by weakening consumer sentiment. Next up, UBS upgrading Konagra to buy, saying the company is likely in the early stages of a positive revision cycle. And finally, Gordon Haskehead upgrading raw stores to buy, highlighting the strengthening demand for off-priced retailers, a theme that we have been seeing across a number of different retailers. Cross marks Bob Dole, seeing too many question marks for sustainable equity rally, that conversation coming up next. This is Bloomberg. Who Is那就 terrific? China's military power has been growing at an incredible speed over the last 20 years. A strong country must have a strong military as only then can it guarantee the security of the nation. In terms of sphere of influence, we absolutely know that China wants to be dominant in Asia. So there is a target to get to that point, to be a military that is a peer to the greatest militaries in the world by 2035. The competition for influence is a global one. And through a multi-decade trajectory fueled by planning, money, and pragmatism, China is building a military that allows it to shape the 21st century just as the US shaped the 20th.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,557,2022-11-18 14:29:44

The company covers climate change like Bloomberg, your global business authority. This is Bloomberg Daybreak with Lake Group WorkWraith. Welcome to Daybreak Australia. Welcome to Bloomberg crypto. This is countdown to the open on Lisa Agrawas in for Jonathan Farrow is behind her ring the opening bell. I'm in New York Stock Exchange. We are looking at a lift to markets right now. The SVG is up and down to some percent. That's that features up more than up percent. Basically try to come up with a narrative today. I can't good luck, have a good time doing so you're seeing yields up a little bit and getting that hawker speak. Not necessarily creating any sort of clear cut narrative after a week of tumult after a week where I think we're going to probably end up gaining by the end. Meanwhile we are looking at retailers after a slew of earnings that have largely come up and have expected with a few pitfalls. Right now parsing through all of that including foot lockers providing resilient demand to advocate to do little joining now. Abby. Yeah well this week has really been very interesting in terms of retail. It started off with a bullish pop with Walmart and then target not so much. Now we've had a lot of discretionary retailers are doing quite well. You just mentioned foot lockers seems that folks are willing to pay up for their seekers despite the inflationary pressures which Kevin Kelly of Kelly ETFs just rode in saying that suggests we're not in a recession. Maybe so they beat and they also raised their holiday outlook or at least it's better than feared raw stores. The discounter really doing quite well the stock and the company the stock is up 17% and that is an actual lift. There's not a lot of a short interest there. They beat they raise it seems as those sales momentum is going well. On the other hand if you go into some of the more luxury items where a lack of better way to put it William Sonoma down 10.6%. They are not reiterating or updating their outlook. It suggests that they have little to no visibility going forward far fetch up our excuse me down 5.9% stock results and reduce guidance there. So again mixed results it seems to be company by company. But one thing that we do have is discretionary the valuation coming in similar to consumer staples. If you take a look at consumer staple does consumer discretionary of minus the PE of the consumer staple space in blue there you see it coming down coming down coming down coming down. So that tells you that folks that investors are concerned that this discretionary spending that some of the pockets of weakness that we're seeing it's not worth paying up for. And then finally though there is maybe a little bit of hope here Lisa if you take a look at these the chart that we are looking at. This is earnings for combined group of discretionary retailers right now perhaps trapping somewhere around 23 to $24. Next year in the first quarter and the second quarter it's expected to go up to 26 even $32 for that quarter for that batch of retailers. The feds probably the wild card lots of folks out there thinking that their hiking cycle is done. If so that probably helps retailers if not and I'm not sure we've really heard that from the Fed. Needy there's a little bit more pain to go let's say. Abby thank you so much a great job parsing through sort of the strength in the weakness and hard to get consistent narrative there. Rollercoaster year meanwhile for big tech keeping the NASDAQ 100 almost 30% below its record high. Kaley lines is here with more Kaley Lisa the date of that last record high November 19th 2021 so it has been almost exactly a year that we haven't reached a new all-time high.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,558,2022-11-18 14:34:02
17945," High. KELOLANDS is here with Mark Kaley. Lisa, the date of that last record high, November 19th, 2021. So it has been almost exactly a year that we haven't reached a new all time high on that index. Of course, big tech stocks, which make up the bulk of that benchmark, underperforming the broader market this year. As we have seen interest rates rising, just take a look at the two year yield up about 400 basis points from where we were a year ago. That is just absolutely astounding and helps explain why these higher multiple stocks are having a lot higher difficulty over the last 12 months. In fact, when you think about how far away last November 19th is, that was 249 trading days ago. So this makes the longest stretch without a record high since the dot com era and actually the third longest ever took the index more than 15 years or 3925 trading days to recover from the dot com crash and 416 to rebound from the crash of 1987. So we're not quite at those extremes yet, but when you take a look at the technical perspective, this index has been below its 200 years. So it's been a long time since the last 10 years of the pandemic. It's been a long time since the last 10 years of the pandemic. So if it goes another 10 trading days under that level, it will also be the longest period since the dot com bubble. As for the individual stocks that have been helping create that drag just five names have contributed to half of the indexes losses over the last year. Amazon about 12% of it met a Microsoft roughly 10% each. Those three stocks collectively are worth $2.3 trillion less than software. And it will give you money as well, but it has been brutal for these heavy weight names. Lisa Kelly lines. Thank you so much. And there's also a question about how much they can rally going forward? Cross marks Bob doll seeing more room for this bear market. Bear rally to run writing quote, Well, a further year end rally is possible conditions for a sustained upturn in stocks is not likely to develop until there's more visibility and inflation and earnings. A necessary the market. The market is looking for some sort of calm amid the turmoil. Will it require some sort of peeking out inflation that we have not yet seen but maybe are beginning to see at this point. To get a sustained rally lease, I think that's the correct answer. To get a leading rally forward. I think that's what we were doing. There could be more in the fourth quarter year.illy. I don't think we exceed the 200 day moving average by much if at all. which doesn't leave a whole lot of upside-from here. I see a lot of churning until we get more clarity on the fed and inflation and interest rates and all the things you've been talking about. sentiment, the positioning, played a big part in the stock reaction. And I think that's going to be really in play through the next couple of months and as you report fourth quarter in the beginning of next year, I don't think investors are willing to jump in wholesale at this point until they have a sense for where the terminal rate is going to be and what the overall impact on multiples will be. So Bob, very much echoing some of what you were saying, looking for that stability in the bond market in the meantime though, are there pockets of equities that you see attractive, particularly as some of these left for dead names, perhaps before a slight bit better than expected? Yeah, in general, as you know, third quarter earnings were less bad than feared and some of the pockets had done better, just highlighted one. The retail numbers, I know they were in great, they were mixed, but there were a lot of positive surprises and the death of the consumer that so many people have been talking about, not really. Look at retail sales. So I think picking over some of that area, some of the tech stocks that have gotten hit hard, probably good for a trade, I don't know about an investment. I think still the HMOs have had a pullback. I suspect they're not finished in this one that we're enjoying here at your end. So how much are you going into retail at this point? Not a whole lot, very selective on names, on some Walmart, on some Macy's. Not a whole lot more than that, but there's some names I wish I had on these last week or two. How much do you have to get scaled though? How much can you be a stock picker at a moment when everything is being dominated by macro trends and things can shift on a dime based on that? Yeah, great question.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,559,2022-11-18 14:39:02
17946," friends and things can shift on a dime based on that. Yeah, great question. I think you have to you have to be cognizant of the macro. But of course, there are winners and losers. Like the retail is a perfect example. What's the macro for the consumer? We can debate that. But even within that, there are winners and our losers. My attitude has been in this market as a portfolio manager, Lisa, to be more reactive than usual. In other words, when there are a lot of big down days in a row, a lot of red on the screen, buy a few stocks. Conversely, when we got a lot of green, sell a few stocks. I think Lini against the win is sentiment. Rolls from one end of the boat to the other so very quickly in this uncertain period. How do you how do you remain that nimble at a time when a lot of people talk about strained liquidity and basic benchmark markets like treasuries? Well, there's there's more liquidity out there, particularly for smaller investors than one might think. I don't think that is a big deal. And so picking your price points when you get them can be great on the buy and the sell side when volatility is so high, use volatility to your advantage. Don't be scared by it. What about the wild ride that you see in tech? Can you have the same kind of momentum trade that you're talking about to capture dollars to lean against sentiment? Or is that a different story? Tech has been very difficult as we know. And the trades can be vicious but are often very short lived. And that's the truth for bear market rallies in general as you know. So I think picking them off is a you've got to be very careful. Wait for your price. You don't have to get ahead of the curve on these things. I'm not sure their leadership under performance is over yet. Do you have a sense, Bob, how much of the portfolio should be active like you said on a day to day, taking advantage of big moves one way or another and how much should be sort of a theory driven that you know inflation is going to roll over next year that the Fed is going to keep rates at 5% perhaps for at least nine to 12 months before reassessing all of these kinds of macro drivers to sort of have a permanent longer view look. How do you distribute that? Yeah, I know I sounded like a trader with the last few answers. I'm just talking about trading around core positions, not wholesale in and out. And I think you hit some of the key issues. Even if we are going to solve inflation, it's not going to be today or tomorrow. It's going to take some time. If the Fed really wants to percent inflation, we got a long way to go. If they're going to do a pause after December and wait and see what impact the most vicious rise and interest rates in Fed history has been, which might be smart of them to see what impact it's had. We're probably going to have some earnings disappointments out there. Fourth quarter earnings, I think are going to be dicey again and some will kitchen sink and look for better things than 23. A lot of people when I look at the outlooks for next year talk about a new bond boom market. Essentially, we've had the worst year on record for treasuries, at least in modern history. Next year will be a great one because the Fed is committed to bringing inflation under control and will achieve their goal. Do you agree? I mean, do you think that it's going to be just a bang up awesome year for duration? I think duration will win next year, but I'm not sure I'm ready to say, you know, it's a brand spanking new boom market. We're going straight up. Our view is when 10 year treasury yields as I've done three or four times, get above 4 percent, start nibbling. You don't have to be a hero here. I don't think we're going to end up with some huge move in bonds and much lower yields next year. We're still going to have an underlying inflation issue as the year progresses. Bob Dole. Thank you so much for your time. Have a great weekend. Let's take a look at some of that trading activity that Bob was talking about back with us is Abigail Dole-Ital. Abby. Well, let's take a look at the crypto space because it seems as though there's a little bit of a hopeful stabilization here. And this, of course, a week after chapter 11 for FTX and the resignation of SBF. There is actually, now we're seeing a decline earlier. We had been looking at big, big gains. And this speaks to the volatility in the price action here for this crypto space that it continues as Bitcoin itself is basically flattering between gains and losses. But there is evidence that some of these investors are decentralizing on blockade that's open to the public that had been adding hope earlier, not so much. Let's see how the day plays on. As for some other move on the day, let's take a look at what's working. AMD and some of the other chips gaining actually in video is up just slightly. And we're seeing some.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,560,2022-11-18 14:42:59
17947," plays on as for some other move on the day. Let's take a look at what's working AMD and some of the other chips gaining actually in video is up just slightly. So we're seeing some of the big gainers in the pre market action lease that coming back in Tesla. In fact earlier had been up 1% but it seems that it is back down. Perhaps if some investors are wondering what the toll of Twitter will be on Elon Musk and his role at Tesla Carnival Corp there. We have the gains continuing up 2% yesterday. The cruise operators had been in sharply after the pandemic. So we're seeing that in the last couple of days. And your region was downgraded plus Carnival just did a big debt convertible debt offering and then finally one reliable group of gainers. The gain sticking from the pre market to now lease that of course is the meme stocks AMC of 4% and apparently Disney's black Panther is expected to do very well at the box office again this weekend after speaking with Bob doll. I wonder how much is just a trading of people trying to lean against the recent moves. Abigail. Thank you so much coming up. The headwinds continuing to pile up for big things.

Music Music Music So now you've been a taping worker for about 25 years. Yes. Okay. So and now you run one of the most important parts of JP Morgan, which is, I say, is the asset and wealth management business. What actually is wealth management? And how is that different than asset management? Great question. The two are often used interchangeably, but they have distinctions. Asset management business is where we manage money on behalf of individuals, institutions, sovereign wealth funds, pension funds. We manage them in mutual funds. We manage them in ETFs. We manage them in single stock, single bonds. Hege funds. Private equity. And the like. And that is the heart of the fiduciary business that we run here at JP Morgan. Wealth management is that plus understanding someone's entire balance sheet. So for the individuals where we manage money, we also help them with their mortgage. We help them with alone that they might need. We help them with their basic credit card. And so wealth management is trying to help someone with their entire life, both their assets and their liabilities. They're planning, they're gifting the legacy that they want to leave for their families. The 529 plans they need to prepare to get their kids to go through college.

17948," Here is a very resilient platform. Elon hasn't done anything to give comfort and confidence in Twitter, but it's still a very important platform on a global basis. So the question is how relevant it will be. That's a big question. Whether it's going to be around, that's not such a big question. The media platform is facing the threat of increasing government intervention. Twitter, the latest, under the microscope, a group of Democratic senators asking the FTC to look into Elon Musk's leadership. Writing quote, Musk has taken alarming steps that have undermined the integrity and safety of the platform. Ed Lodlow, Bloomberg tech co-anchor, joining us for now with the latest ad. What are we waiting for to find out just how much damage is being done to the social media company? Yeah, a lot of the concern from lawmakers and kind of the push to have FTC scrutiny. It's about personnel, right? That Twitter, very quickly, has gone from a team of 7,500 people to then 3,500 after layoffs. And as we've reported overnight, Musk offered the opportunity to those staff remaining to remain if they agreed to his new workplace culture. And many in their hundreds decided that they would rather leave. The worry is that those that have left include people that are responsible for content moderation, for people that are responsible for safety and integrity on the platform. And lawmakers are basically pushing to give the FTC some teeth in policing Twitter, which already has a 2011 agreement with the agency to have minimum standards when it comes to the data protection of its users. I thought, Lodlow, thank you so much. Honestly, we're tracking this throughout the day and trying to understand really what the fate of the company is, NewVian Sarah Malik, seeing a long list of headwinds. Into next year, writing, quote, 2023 earnings estimates are not anchored in reality. We are concerned about future earnings growth, giving cost pressures, high margins, strong dollar in demand destruction from higher rates. Sarah joins us now. That was talking more generally, not specifically about Twitter, which is now a private company. But before we get into some of the public ones that I know that you focus on very much, how do you really view the story of a company that was just the subject of a $44 billion leverage to buy out with a lot of investors behind that now suddenly with question marks existential about its existence? Well, I think Twitter had struggled for a long time. It was a lagging technology stock while it was public with a business model that probably strategically hadn't gone to its potential. And so the question is now, how are we going to get it to what its potential is? It's not clear now that it's a private company. This moves me to the big mega cap tech companies with the NASAC down as significantly as it is. Should we be taking a look at these? A lot of their models are proving to be more cyclical than initially perceived due to their advertising businesses. I think Twitter's in that bucket. And a lot of them been spending pre-heavily into a downturn. And so until these businesses adjust their spending to reflect the quality of their models, I think they're going to struggle. So in technology, we like software companies like Palo Alto Networks and ServiceNow, companies have just strong backlogs and some visibility into their future and more structural tailwinds to growth. And we're certainly seeing other people bid that up today. Sarah, I would do wonder, though, if there's a bigger concern around social media companies in general, Metta's another one Facebook, Wall Street Journal reporting that Congress is looking into after they actually reported that they find and fired certain employees for accepting bribes to potentially interfere with certain accounts, how much is there going to be such increased scrutiny that it's hard to really put any money behind a social media company right now? I agree with you. Regulations are another headwind. So beyond the cyclicality that many of these companies rely on with advertising, we also have to think about what are the macro implications of regulations as a fundamental investor. Those are hard to predict. And it's hard to get that into the valuation. So again, that's why we're avoiding the ones that have heavy regulatory scrutiny because it's a bit of a black box. And sick will advertising businesses on top of the fact that they continue to spend into this downturn, they need to readjust their business models before they become attracted from a valuation point of view again. Given the sort of idiosyncratic nature of specific tech names, how much have you moved away from indexes and really toward a very different type of bucketed investing strategy than you've had over the past 10 years? That's a good point. The growth investor for the past 10 years, you actually had to have...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,562,2022-11-18 14:51:33
17949," heard a very different type of bucketed investing strategy than you've had over the past 10 years. That's a good point. As a growth investor for the past 10 years, you actually had to have, they tended to have lower active share because you had to own those top index names at an overweight in order to beat the benchmark. I think today's growth in tech investors is different. You need to be looking at areas that are resilient, not only software companies, but growth areas that are more reasonably priced like healthcare, a company we like is Zimmer Biomed, which has a nice secular tailwind for demographics, orthopedic procedures should be returning to normal post-COVID revenue growth margin expansion, putting up clean numbers. So we're looking outside of mega-cap tech, which tends to dominate the benchmark into other areas that will differentiate you from the benchmark. I was asking this to Bob Dahl, who was talking about similar types of trades and similar types of single stocks that he is looking at. How do you do that in scale? The question that you have, a significant portfolio that you have to manage? I think with over its trillion dollars in assets across our different asset classes, we're longer term investors. We're looking for those companies that can be resilient to and through a cycle. So first of all, pricing power for next year, that's going to be key with margins at peak levels, earnings at risk, earnings still showing growth for next year when you look at consensus as we probably go into recession, who is the pricing power to continue to overcome the impact costs that they're dealing with, another area long term you can own is companies that grow their dividends. So a resilient company like Lindeis, an industrial gas business, less sensitive to the economy. It beaten, raised on the last quarter, it tends to give conservative guidance. And a 1.5% dividend yields, you get some income protection. I want to own companies that I can own for years. I think it's challenging to continue to market time. You see even these bear market rallies that are pretty extreme when the fundamentals aren't necessarily matching it. So if you're trying to time the market, I think you can't get in and out at the right time. How much consolidation are you expecting among the strongest players, especially given the divergence in terms of pricing power next year? I think that consolidation will continue to be a theme in certain sectors as the strongest stronger in the week at weaker, but we also need to think about interest rates and how are you going to accomplish that consolidation? Dead is a lot more expensive now. So M&A, I think a lot more selective, but as we go through these periods where balance sheets are going to be questioned and tested, if you can't survive, I think you will end up becoming an acquired company. Do you think that retail is going to see a lot more in terms of acquisitions? I think retail will continue to consolidate because of the long-term trend of digital over brick and mortar. The interesting thing is that consumer has been very resilient through the cycle. We are seeing them start to dip into their savings rates in order to keep spending, but the answers that they do keep spending and they still have a lot of savings. So between consumer and employment, that's why if you go to the Fed and think about how long they can continue to raise rates, we have a strong consumer, a reasonably strong economy and inflation that still in our all-time highs. That's why our view is that we have slower for longer rate hikes, 50 basis points in December, but continued rate hikes into early perhaps mid 2023. Sarah Malik, thank you so much for being with us.

I mean, the reason that I was interested in doing this in the first place was a much bigger challenge than making a comfortable shoe or doing something in the fashion industry as a narrow opportunity. We thought that there was a big leadership opportunity. We looked around at an industry where there was 20 billion pairs of sneakers made every single year and it was 100% made from plastic and the hides from cows and it was terrible for the environment. We thought that we could offer something to consumers that was differentiated in the way it feels more comfortable, higher performance and do that because we used sustainable materials. And in doing so, we could take a really interesting leadership opportunity and grab that and use that to tell a totally different story and compete on a totally different vector than what the rest of the industry were doing.

That's going to be the best question I get online. Bloomberg Television. Top Experts. Great Questions. Music. Pepsi's number fever campaign in the Philippines has probably gone down in history as one of the biggest marketing disasters in history. Mainly because of a human error that led Pepsi to print more winning caps than they planned. The resulting chaos caused riots, civil unrest, and even deaths. Reporting this story took over a year and it resulted in me flying to Manila in the Philippines to meet unlucky winners. And to find out exactly what happened back then in the 1990s. My name is Jeff Mesh. I'm a journalist based in Los Angeles. I wrote the story for Bloomberg Business Week about Pepsi's number fever campaign. The Philippines is a really interesting country. It's made up of thousands of islands. And it's also a country that's very heavily influenced by America. American culture is everywhere you look in the Philippines. They're obsessed with Frank Sinatra music, for example. They love all things America. And that extends to their love for soft drinks. Pepsi Cola, Coca Cola. In the 1990s, it was everywhere. I'm in the park. Pepsi and Coca Cola were embroiled in what is now known as the Cola Wars. It was a fierce battle for market dominance. Number fever was already a really popular promotion. It had been rolled out in America to great success. And so Pepsi decided to roll it out internationally, particularly in Asia. They thought it was the answer to their problems. They thought it could finally help them beat their biggest competitor. In the name of one, I won! Look for the winning number in size high for a 7-game alpha on TV, really a new paper. A new could be a millionaire. A million pesos or $6,000,000 doesn't sound like a lot now. But in 1992, that was a phenomenal amount of money. You've got to remember that in the Philippines at the time, the average monthly income was about $100. So a million pesos was wealth beyond anyone's wildest imaginations. Number fever caught fire in the Philippines. Kids were saving up their pocket money to buy a bottle of Pepsi. Parents were squirreling away. All of the bottle caps in bags. You would walk down the street and people were going through trash trying to find discarded bottle caps. It was a national phenomenon. Pepsi boasted that half the population of the Philippines was playing it. Number fever boosted Pepsi's sales every month from $10 million to $14 million. It had a huge impact on Pepsi's bottom line. Number fever quickly became number hysteria. Mades were being jailed for stealing their employer's winning bottle caps. There was even some murders over winning bottle caps. People were fighting in the streets over these caps. There were signs that there were going to be problems with number fever very early. Pepsi had...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,565,2022-11-18 15:04:40
17952," feats over these caps. There were signs that there were going to be problems with number fever very early. Pepsi had rolled out the competition in Chile, and a garbled fax had caused some kind of problem with the winning number. They'd announced the wrong one in Chile, causing riots. There were signs that there could be big problems ahead if they didn't keep their eye on the ball. So in 1992, Pepsi decided to extend the campaign in the Philippines, and they announced that the competition would go on for a few more weeks. One night, on the television news, they announced the latest winning number, 3, 4, 9. The problem was, 3, 4, 9 had already been allocated as a non-winning number in earlier campaigns. So there were literally hundreds of thousands of bottle caps with 3, 4, 9. Just floating around the Philippines, hundreds of thousands of people, all across the Philippines, thousands of islands, were finding winning bottle caps, 3, 4, 9, 3, 4, 9. Some people had 10 lucky 3, 4, 9 bottle caps. People were dancing in the street, celebrating. They thought their problems were over. They were millionaires. It's still not certain exactly how many winners there were of lucky 3, 4, 9 bottle caps, but we know that Pepsi printed over 600,000 of them. Pepsi realized very early that there was a problem. Hundreds of people started arriving at their bottling plants with their lucky bottle caps. They realized something was seriously wrong. Pepsi tried to solve the problem by offering a small token donation to anyone that brought a lucky bottle cap to their bottling plan. But it wasn't enough. People didn't want just a handful of pesos. People wanted their million pesos prize. Within a year, violent protests and riots outside Pepsi factories would leave dozens injured and five people dead. At one Pepsi factory in the Philippines, a grenade was thrown through the window. It killed three Pepsi employees. Anna Sita Rosario was a schoolteacher living near Manila in the Philippines. She was one of the tragic victims of this whole thing. She was walking to a nearby store to buy some rice one day when a monitor of cocktail was thrown at a Pepsi truck in a violent protest. It bounced under the truck and exploded. It killed her and an innocent bystander who was just a child and injured many others. When I was in the Philippines, I tracked down Anna Sita's daughter Cindy and her husband, Raul. It was clear to me that they were still very upset by the whole thing. A family had been ripped apart by this competition. And Raul told me that he'd never remarried. He'd told me that he'd gone to meet Pepsi executives after his wife was killed. And he was angry. He said to them, this wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for you, if it wasn't for number fever. The biggest revelation from my reporting was rumors that Pepsi was somehow involved in bombing their own trucks. I found a newspaper report with a headline that said Pepsi goons bombed their own trucks. And when I visited the MBI, the police department in the Philippines, they presented me with documents and interviews with people who claimed that Pepsi had paid them to cause riots and to cause trouble outside their plants. In order to destabilize the situation and to frame the owners of the coalitions that were fighting them to try and curry favor, I just thought that was so shocking. And of course Pepsi denied it, but how bizarre that a company would be accused of bombing their own trucks. The contest had sparked so much anger in the film.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,566,2022-11-18 15:09:17
17953," their own trucks. The contest had sparked so much anger in the Philippines because it landed at just this really weird time in the Philippines' history. It was during a crazy election that was racked with allegations of fraud. The Philippines was in a kind of love-hate relationship with America. They loved obviously the American aid and finances that was pouring into the country, but at the same time they yearned for independence. They wanted to be their own country. Vicente Del Fiero was a local preacher living in Manila and he hated the number fever campaign. Del Fiero thought Pepsi's number fever campaign was just one of the many ways that America was asserting its dominance over a third world country. He hated seeing his fellow countrymen get ripped off in his eyes by this huge multinational American company. He wanted justice. Del Fiero rounded up over 800 winners of 349 bottle caps and he got them all together to sue Pepsi for over $400 million to be divided between those holders of lucky bottle caps. Del Fiero took money from some of the people who could afford it. They paid him 500 pesos to help with legal fees, but for people who couldn't afford the money he would just represent them pro bono. I love him, though. He'd be about to pay for it. I'm about to pay for him. And for people who are making the food. But he had mounted that on that campaign. He didn't do it. He didn't do it. He flew to America and he hired two consumer lawyers here in America to take on Pepsi. He had a meeting at Pepsi's headquarters to try and resolve the problem. But he said he wanted to take it all the way to the highest courts in America. When those cases were heard in America, those courts decided that this was a problem that should be heard in the Philippines, not in America. Back in the Philippines, Del Fiero continued his case in the Filipino courts. At one stage, there were arrest warrant's handed out for nine Pepsi-Cola executives, which he saw as a big victory. We don't know if those arrest warrant were ever upheld, but it made newspaper headlines across the country. Pepsi did not take kindly to Del Fiero's campaign. They tried everything to shut him down. They sued him for libel. My father had to attend three times a month for a branch one for a campaign. And another heating for the branch one, 13, also three times a month. Also, there was a time my father's was hospital. Jeweldo heart failure still had to attend the two branch heating of otherwise. For not attending the judge, we'll issue water to the next month's father. My father passed away January 13, 2010, after staying for almost one year in the hospital, he died of complications due to heart failure. After the death of my father, I was inspired to do the website. Mexico will be remembered for what they did to the consumer in the Philippines and to my father. When I reached out to Pepsi for comment for this story, they claimed that they didn't have access to anyone who was working at Pepsi that was around in those days. They also said that during COVID-19, they didn't have access to their documents about this, but they were very careful to say that they were sorry for everything that happened, and we do know that Pepsi did try everything to try and make this right. The Pepsi number fever disaster cost the company millions. We know that they paid up to $10 million in those good world payments, but the financial effect could be much greater. After the disaster, we know that Pepsi sales dipped.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,567,2022-11-18 15:13:13
17954," Greater. After the disaster we know that Pepsi sales dipped, they were overtaken by Coca-Cola again. Pepsi's number fever disaster changed the legacy of that soft drink in the Philippines forever. Some people of certain age won't touch it. For many people Pepsi is a taboo word. A lot of the people that I spoke to were still quite traumatized by their experience, by that experience of winning a million pesos, losing it and then returning to their normal life in poverty in Manila. When the news of the bombing came out, it was a massive story in Germany. We are following some breaking news coming to us out of Dortmund in Germany. It was covered by all the media outlets. Three roadside explosions triggered at the same time last night as the coach left its hotel in the south of Dortmund. Public figures commented on it. We should not let them affect our our life whatever it was. The media echo went far beyond Dortmund. I think it was front page news and every single big paper around Europe. Everyone thought of like a terrorist attack and people were scared that throughout the city in Dortmund there was more attacks to be happening. Unbeknownst to investigators just after the bomb went off and the players of the team were shell shocked. The person who had mastered my mind at the attack was actually sitting in the hotel eating steak and sweet potatoes. Dortmund is a mid-sized city in the western part of Germany in a state called North Rhein-Westphalia. It's a former industrial city that's kind of fallen on hard times in the last few decades. It was severely bombed in the war so the center of the city is quite stark. Some of the few high points include its soccer team. My name is Aikening. I'm a reporter with Bloomberg News and I'm a great fan of Borussia Dortmund. Dortmund fans are super loyal. On all match days the entire city is in black and yellow. It's like a religion. I think more than most German cities soccer does play a very large role in the identity of Dortmund. In October of 2000 the BBB became the first team in the Bundesliga to actually go public. Salaries for soccer players in the Bundesliga have gone up very dramatically with such high prices they thought that by going public they would be able to compete better with big teams like by Unmutedk. Unfortunately that didn't go too well. Dortmund bought too many expensive players high wages and the club almost went bust in 2005. The price of their shares it has sometimes gone up but mostly gone down since they made that decision. So on April 11th 2017 the team was staying in a hotel on the outskirts of Dortmund. Match days are always special in Dortmund. Everyone is looking forward to it. The team always meets in the same hotel ahead of matches. They stayed in the hotel in order to have a kind of neutral.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,568,2022-11-18 15:17:34
17955," Always special in Dortmund, everyone is looking forward to it. The team always meets in the same hotel ahead of matches. They stayed in this hotel in order to have a kind of neutral space before game, so that they could concentrate, be sort of isolated from distractions, things like that. Everyone was pretty optimistic there to chance to go really far, maybe into the finals. I was in the office and getting ready for match day. It was going to meet with a friend, a fellow Dortmund supporter in the pub. As always, the fans are very excited about matches. On that day, they were heading to play in the quarter-final against AS Monaco at Signal Iduna Stadium, which is in the centre of Dortmund. Shortly before 7pm, the players of the team boarded their official team bus. When the bus took off the parking lot of the hotel and turned on the street, there were three detonations, three bombs that exploded and hit the bus off Dortmund. Three explosions occurred close to the Borussia Dortmund team bus. The B team bus had just left the hotel. The explosions destroyed two windows in the rear part of the bus. People screamed, people jumped to the ground. The fellow Dortmund fan, I was supposed to watch the match with. He called me and said, turn on the TV, there was an attack of the Dortmund bus. I thought he was like, there was impossible. Some of the players screamed at the driver to keep driving as fast as possible because they were worried that people might storm the bus. German investigators say the explosive devices, used in the attack on the Borussia Dortmund bus, contained metal pins and the one had pierced a seat headrest. Unbeknownst to the team members, the actual mastermind behind the attack was as they were disembarking the bus, was actually eating steak and sweet potatoes at the hotel they had just left. Authorities were attempting to verify a letter left at the scene, claiming Jihadists were behind the attack. Because there had been a series of attacks by Islamic terrorists in Germany and Europe, there was a widespread suspicion in the media that this was another Islamic terror attack. Three letters were found at the site of the bombing that took credit for the attack on behalf of Islamic State. There were however reasons to doubt this particular narrative. Would actually be a surprise if ISIS were actually part of this attack. Possibly could be employed by other groups like the Far Right wing to try and shift the blame. The letters had some strange qualities. They were written in a strange German that used big sophisticated words, but had basic grammar mistakes as if someone was native German speaker but pretending to be a foreign person. Federal investigators have detained one man, suspected of links to Islamist terrorism, one of two suspects whose apartments were raided this morning. Shortly after the bombing, a man in Austria named Rudolf, who was a big BBB fan, he noticed that something strange was going on on the stock market related to the team's shares. He emailed the lawyers of BBB who then forwarded that email on to investigators. The email stated that someone had bought 60,000 BBB put options, and the manager of the team would follow a certain amount of the amount of the amount. I would buy that ahead of a match and then three bombs go off. Something is right here. For the person to make money off of that, it required the stock to go down quite a bit in a fairly short period of time. It wouldn't just be the team losing match, it would require something much bigger than that. There was another big red flag about this purchase, which is the fact that it had actually been made. Number one on the day of the bombing, but also from an IP address that had been traced to the actual hotel where the bombing had taken place. When three explosions targeted the bus, carrying the Borussia Dortmund for ballers on April 11th, written notes left at the scene claimed the attack was the work of ISIL. The truth.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,569,2022-11-18 15:21:59
17956," Written notes left at the scene claimed the attack was the work of ISIL. The truth, as is now alleged, is remarkable. On April 21st, the police arrested a man in a southern German city called Tubingen. It was on his way to work and his name was Sergei Bina-Gord. He seemed like an unlikely suspect because he had no known connections to the Islamic terror world. He didn't seem like a far-right extremist. He didn't seem like a left-wing extremist either. He seemed to be a completely unremarkable young man. A 28-year-old German Russian man named only as Sergei W stayed in the same hotel as the players on the night before the bombing. He specifically requested an upper room overlooking the bushes where the explosive devices were hidden. The media dissected why he would do that, what was his past. He had been inspired by the 2015 terror attack in Paris. And he noticed that in the aftermath of the attack, the stocks of French companies went down. And he believed that if an attack took place that was directed at a specific company, that the decrease in stock price for that company would be even more dramatic. It never occurred to anyone that someone would do that out of greed. We now know that the suspect bought three different derivatives on the Borussia Dortmund shares, with all these derivatives he bet on falling shares. The suspect bought the majority of these financial products on the 11th of April, the day of the attack. If the plot had been completed successful and the stock had reached a value of zero, the intergold would have made up to 570,000 euros or the equivalent of about $608,000. Ultimately, the plan completely backfired. The attacker, Sege Benicolout, didn't make any money, in fact, he lost money. In court, he would be extremely quiet. He usually kept his hands clasped together. One of the lawyers actually commented that he had never seen a defendant act so calmly. The intergold had served some time in the German military. From that information and from online research, he was able to figure out how to assemble remote, detonated bombs that would do what he hoped to do. There were a few days of extremely emotional testimony, including the soccer players who described, doubting whether or not they could ever play another game again. It brought everything back up and it didn't quite help them to kind of process what was going on. Throughout it all, he sat there completely silent. The big mystery that was swirling around the trial was the question of why he may have simply done it because he wanted to impress a woman. Rebecca is a young woman who has a very troubled home life. She ultimately sees her relationship with Vaynergold as an opportunity to leave that troubled home. Vaynergold is a Russian immigrant to Germany. He speaks with an accent. He has anxiety in large groups of Germans. She begins to resent the fact that he has these fears and feels a little bit trapped. Rebecca attempts to dump him on multiple occasions and he threatens to commit suicide if she leaves him. Vaynergold apparently told Rebecca that she would soon be seeing a surprise. After being dumped via text message, he apparently began planning for this attack in earnest. Vaynergold was charged with 28 counts of attempted murder, which carried a maximum sentence in Germany of life in prison. He claimed that he had nothing to do with the attack, but as time went on, he admitted that he had actually been the person who had built the explosives and had set them off. But he claimed that he didn't want to actually kill anybody. Ultimately Vaynergold didn't receive the harshest possible sentence. He was given 14 years in prison, but it's still a considerable amount.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,570,2022-11-18 15:26:20
17957," Ultimately, Vayner Gold didn't receive the harshest possible sentence he was given 14 years in prison, but it's still a considerable amount in jail in Germany. The threat of an asteroid hitting Earth is very real. If it's big enough, it's also very final. About a hundred tons of space rock falls on Earth every day. Most of it is so small it burns up in our atmosphere, or lands unnoticed away from major populations. No human in the past thousand years is known to have been killed by a meteorite, and according to NASA, no large object is likely to strike the Earth any time in the next several hundred years. However, one thing is certain, we haven't found them all. There are thousands out there and we don't know where they are. There are a lot of asteroids in our solar system. They number in the billions. Scientists all over the world are working toward detecting and deflecting the most catastrophic of natural disasters. Amy, let's get this one out of the way. It's probably the question you get asked the most, how scared should we be? Asteroids and comets are a natural hazard that's out there, like a lot of other natural hazards. These are very, very infrequent events, these collision events where an object actually impacts the Earth. The most important thing that we need to know about asteroids is when the next impact is going to happen and how bad it will be. What we know is that an object that's about, say, a kilometer across is capable of causing very, very wide devastation across the planet, really, truly global devastation. The object that wiped out the dinosaurs was somewhere in the neighborhood of five to ten kilometers across, so even bigger than that. At a kilometer, it's still going to be very bad and will have global effects. For objects that are capable of causing what I would call sort of regional damage, kind of a large major metropolitan area, a city in its surrounding environments, sort of around a hundred kilometers. It depends on the details of the composition and so forth. By the 1980s, NASA was cataloging near-earth objects. In 1994, Stargazers watched as comet Schumacher-Levy 9 hit Jupiter. The resulting zone of chaos was estimated to be as large as the Earth, and the event became a turning point in the search for asteroids and comets in our solar system. In 1998, Congress tasked NASA with finding 90% of asteroids and comets 1 kilometer wide or larger. Soon after, Hollywood blockbusters Armageddon and Deep Impact brought attention and fear to the masses. The great news is that the vast majority of more than 90% of all the really large one-kilometer near-earth objects have been found. The challenge now is working down to these smaller sizes that are still quite capable of causing a lot of damage, but they're just harder to spot because they're fainter, they're small.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,571,2022-11-18 15:30:40
17958," capable of causing a lot of damage, but they're just harder to spot because they're faint hurt. They're smaller. Can you give us a sense of how many are out there in our solar system? We know that there are a lot of asteroids in our solar system. They number in the billions. Most of them, however, are between Mars and Jupiter in what we call the main asteroid belt. This is a region of space where most of the asteroids in the inner part of our solar system live, and they stay there for many billions of years. There is another population, though, that kind of leaks inward and gets into the region somewhat close to the earth. And we call these near-earth objects. We think that there are millions and millions of near-earth objects that are out there in the total population. As of today, we know of sort of around 20, 25,000, something like that. When we first spot an object, we really know very little about it. We just see something moving across the sky. So all you get is just sort of a handful of snapshots, just enough to be able to tell that this isn't an asteroid that we've already seen before. And then once we can calculate the distance to it, we can now start to make predictions about its true size. Is it large or is it small? So we have a lot of information that we have to get pretty quickly to really understand what's going on. Finding asteroids is just one piece of the puzzle. Planetary scientists are extremely skilled in determining the orbits and speeds of asteroids based on relatively small amounts of data. NASA runs simulations of the trajectories asteroids could take, which is useful but time consuming. A team of scientists in the Netherlands have found a way that could buy us more time. Our methods is fairly quick. So you can very quickly get an assessment of whether or not the object is danger or not. If you look at the classical way of determining the danger of an asteroid, it may take days of computing time on very big machines to determine this hazardousness. The current problem is that there's just too many asteroids out there to spend a huge amount of computational power on all of them. So the neural network allows us to focus on what really could go and pose a hazard to Earth. A neural network is a computing system that mimics the way the human brain operates to find underlying relationships in a set of data. By training the network in this way, you train it in recognizing those objects that are most likely to hit the planet. And once it's trained, you can apply this network to all the unknown asteroids. And then you can make a selection and saying, hey, this is these are the ones which appear to be having orbits similar to the ones which we know are hitting the planets. That doesn't mean that they do, but it does. It only means that they look very similar to the ones we know they do. What else did you find? Should we be particularly concerned about anything? One thing that we did find is that our neural network was able to go and identify a handful of asteroids which weren't considered potentially hazardous that when we went into the gradient of them forward in time, they came quite close to Earth. You find a handful which were not detected before or not considered being dangerous before, and we think they are potentially dangerous. It's very hard to simulate kind of going forward in time and asteroid that's going to hit Earth because what the Earth is really small and what space is really big. And then you have to have very exact parameters to shoot an asteroid that goes and hits exactly Earth. And then Simon had the ingenious idea of not even trying to do that and just launching the asteroids from Earth's surface and integrating backwards in time. It's very hard to make it hit. So you need a lot of calculations which all end up in nothing. And the idea was then like, well, let's not do that. This is basically what NASA is doing. NASA is taking an asteroid, making multiple copies of them, shooting them all forward in time, calculating their orbits, and then see what fraction sort of gets close to Earth. Not even hitting Earth, but getting close to Earth. And then they call it a potential impactor. So you calculate the solar system forward in time for let's say a thousand years. And then you launch asteroids from the surface as if they if you go forward in time would follow on the surface, you calculate them backwards due today. And then you get your orbital parameters of today's asteroid which you know will.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,572,2022-11-18 15:35:08
17959," If you go forward in time, we'd follow on the surface, you calculate and backwards to today, and then you get your orbital parameters of today's asteroid, which you know will land on the planet. And those you can use as known impactors and compare these all the other asteroids in the in the solar system. Consimulations and AI, can those things fill in the gaps where perhaps telescopes and other imaging tools can't? Absolutely, since the observations get more complex, the physics gets more complex, and if the physics gets more complex, the mathematics becomes more complex, and at some point you can't solve your problems analytically anymore, and then this is where the computer comes in. Now we have this trained neural network, we have a way of calculating, in a fraction of a second, whether or not an asteroid is potentially dangerous or not, and therefore deserves more attention or more time to spend on for redefining how it is dangerous. When it comes to hunting asteroids, time is critical. What we can do about a potentially hazardous object depends a great deal on what we know about it, and how much time we have before the encounter. We'd really like to find them on their decades away, because the more time you have, the more options you have, and the less energy it takes to move an object aside. It also means we might not have to resort to launching a nuclear warhead as an asteroid, until recently pretty much our only choice. That's an option of last resort in my opinion, yes. We have lots of options if you can just simply bump into the object and just nudge it out of the way, that's one possibility, and that's kind of in a way the sort of the simplest thing to think about, just nudge it off its path a little bit with a massive object, a spacecraft, so it's kind of like bowling if you have a long time or a long stretch of runway in the lane, just a very small twist on the bowling ball will make a big change in where it ultimately ends up. Another option would be something where you take a very big, big, massive spacecraft, and you park it next to the object, and you use the force of gravity as a towing rig. That takes longer though, and you need to be able to send a pretty massive spacecraft, and it obviously depends a lot on how big the asteroid is. Other options start to get more and more complicated, and they range from painting one side of the object of white color and painting the other side dark and letting the pressure of lights or perturb its orbit. In a departure from the lab and computer simulations, NASA has real plans to rehearse kinetic impact deflection. In 2021, the agency will launch DART, the double asteroid redirection test mission, which will intercept a 160 meter asteroid in 2022. Better to practice now before we have to deal with an actual threat. In the meantime, discovering asteroids is our best bet. Thousands of scientists and amateur astronomers around the world make up an informal network that surveyed the heavens. But that may not be enough. NASA wants more resources to map our solar system and better technology. We need to ramp up our network of sensors, and also we need to just continue to strengthen our network of international observers so that we can get follow-up because we find these objects when they're distributed all over the late sky. Once we get more observations, we get better data, we can make better predictions. If you look at the big impactors we have had in the last, let's say, 20 years or maybe 30 years or 50 years, most of them we haven't seen coming. So the danger, the real danger I think comes from the objects we don't know about and not from the objects we do know about. This particular natural disaster, like a lot of natural disasters, and like climate change, is a problem with the global commons. So the thing that we risk collectively is that it sort of than becomes nobody's problem and nobody takes ownership over it. The asteroids are all over the sky. They just truly cross boundaries and borders with a second's notice. They're kind of imagining the future. Maybe he locks a small satellite around the earth that are always going and looking out for, I mean, I think it's something worth investing in.

17960," Music Music Music The pandemic has affected everyone in different ways. Some pass the time by baking. Homemade sourdough bread. Do I need to say more? Some show to binge watch Netflix. It's your game. Or maybe you started a garden oasis in your backyard. Next I'm going to put my letsis in. But for millions of others. I'm going to be posting stocks that will... Boom! They wanted to uproot the financial industry. Let's just lock it on up and take 50,000 dollars! Here's your stock that can change your life. I see a stock going up and I buy it and I just watch it until it stops going up and then I sell it. I have gained over 3 million dollars. I want some free money. I don't think you can overstate the online communities of social media influence on financial markets. A large group of inexperienced investors who discuss their plans on social media platform Reddit have shaken up the stock market in a big way. The stock that everybody's talking about right now is GameStop. Video game retailing GameStop has set to continue the headspinning ascent today. The revolutionaries on Reddit are spanking Wall Street's ass. The more these stocks go up, the more the big guys are getting creamed and losing billions of dollars. This is in a wealthy person's game anymore. Anyone can play it. I took up a little bit of a new hobby and I'm interested in day trading. As an investor nowadays, you don't have to look a specific way. You don't have to wear specific clothes. You don't have to be doing it from a trading floor on Wall Street in like a high-rise building in downtown Manhattan. The narrative of what's driving the markets is no longer being held in secret offices in New York and Boston of privileged people talking to other privileged people. It's right out in the open. It's on Twitter. It's on Reddit. From brokerage apps to discord channels and subreddits to TikTok influencers. One of the last holdouts in the world of disruption, finance is next in line. Investing should be as you pick with us as shopping online. That's Vlad Tenif, the CEO of Robinhood, the online brokerage app. Talking about how he wants his app to disrupt the world of stock trading like Amazon disrupted the world of home shopping. And I think that speaks to exactly the mission that a platform like Robinhood has, which is to democratize investing. Robinhood was started in 2013 by Vlad Tenif and by Jubat in where else Silicon Valley as an alternative to the big brokerages, but with one big difference. As they were building the social network around finances for people, they realized that there was a gap in the market. And that free trading could become something that they could bring to the markets. They could disrupt the industry. While no fee trading is industry standard today, it was unheard of when it was first introduced. The online brokerage industry was really innovative when they came on the scene 10, 15 years ago. But they kind of stopped innovating where you haven't seen those commissions come down beyond five or six or seven dollars. Robinhood, think that by offering zero commission that they're going to push people onto this platform. And on top of no fee trading, the customers Robinhood was courting.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,574,2022-11-18 15:43:46
17961," Hood, think that by offering zero commission, that they're going to push people onto this platform. And on top of No-Fi trading, the customer's Robin Hood was courting, have been long overlooked in the world of finance. So the typical customer of a Charles Schwab, for example, is putting a lot more money in that brokerage account than the typical customer at Robin Hood. Even today, with all of its popularity, the median account size is about $240. There's fiddellities in the Schwabs and the e-trades of the world. They look down their nose at those kind of accounts. I don't want a $1,000 account to just the headache. I want a $100,000 account. And this is key here, right? Because the thing about Robin Hood, that's different than every other single brokerage platform, is how easy it is to use. The design of the Robin Hood app really has in mind a user who might be coming at this absolutely cold. The fonts are very well-sized, the shapes, the colors. All of that is something that the founders of Robin Hood paid really close attention to. And by creating an interface that catered to a newer investor, they were able to gather a pretty healthy group of customers. And by 2019, they had about 10 million customers. Those 10 million customers were a huge success story for Robin Hood, but no one could have predicted its explosion after the arrival of COVID-19. Remain indoors to the greatest extent, and 100% of the non-essential workforce must stay home. What we saw when the pandemic hit was the growth of Robin Hood users absolutely turbocharged. And oddly, you saw this surge in interest in stock trading. Then they saw the absolute surge in 2020 in customer growth. And now, by many accounts, they have more than 20 million customers, which is pretty extraordinary. So the next step for them is to figure out how to monetize those users, and how even with their small account sizes to get them to grow with the company, and as it releases more products, come along with them. Robin Hood would become one of the COVID economies' breakout successes. Robin Hood traders, as they're called, became the shorthand explanation for the frenzy of often speculative retail investing after the pandemic lockdowns. Kids wake up in the morning, they go on Robin Hood. They're, you know, in the shower, they check Robin Hood. Kids are learning how the stock market works at 18, while they're at school, you know, checking their phones in between classes, because notifications pop up telling them what their stocks are doing that day. With these new tools, millennials and Gen Z are investing in the market and ways their parents could have never even dreamt of. That is sort of key when we talk about the divide between older and younger generations is that the younger generation was exposed to so much more information and tools at their disposal to do what they want in the market. The older generations, you never had the technology or the cost structure that you could play the markets like you can today. So you were stuck with giving your money to a professional investor and paying them a fee to do it. When I speak to young kids, they tell me, I'm making mistakes. I'm losing money. I'm not a perfect investor, but I'm 18. And by the time I'm 30, which will be, you know, 10 years from now, I'm going to have interacted with the markets for a decade. And so it's a learning experience more so than anything else. And you can look at it and you can say, wow, that's, you know, that's risk taking that's done. But, you know, if you could possibly share you 10, 20.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,575,2022-11-18 15:48:08
17962," It's a learning experience more so than anything else. And you can look at it and you can say, wow, that's, you know, that's risk taking that's dumb. But, you know, if you could possibly shave 10, 20 years off your working life versus adding five years, I don't think you can fault people for that. But Robinhood is only part of the puzzle. Sure you can trade on it, but without research, information, and data, you're just blindly throwing darts at different stocks and hoping to strike it rich. Wall Street forever has always run on what we now call narratives or needs. You know, people telling rumors to each other to bid around for a hundred years. On Wall Street, information is its own currency. Historically, either you had it or you didn't. And the people who had it had a huge advantage. In the past, those narratives and memes didn't have a network effect. It would be one person telling another person over the phone. In fact, when I broke into this business in the 80s, a lot of people used to complain that they weren't on the call list to get those ideas. Social media changed all of that. Fast forward to 2021. That's being done on the internet now. And that's being done on Discord and Twitter and Stock Twits and Reddit. And the impact is very similar, but orders and orders is meant to too large. This social media has played a bigger part in our lives. It's also played a bigger and kind of more important role in how people find investing ideas online and on these platforms. How do those ideas spread on TikTok? Yes, that TikTok. People aren't just going to it for C-Shanty videos. The personal finance hashtag on TikTok has garnered 3.5 billion views from its 1 billion monthly active users. By comparison, videos found under the cooking and health tips hashtag have 2.6 and 2.1 billion views respectively. The trajectory of Robinhood and TikTok were literally on par. What happened in the stock market this week? So the word of the week is expectations. Absolutely essential that you just understand the risks of shorting. And Kayla Kilbrot and Kyla Scanlon are two of those financial influencer TikTokers, also known as Finn Fluenters. I think people still care about fashion, they care about culture, but it's also like there's this big behemoth thing called the stock market that we really don't know a whole lot about and it's gay kept behind the industry. And so people like want to unpack that. And so my audience is a lot of them are younger investors who are looking to hone their skills. Tech in right up. And Kyla and Kayla are two of the more, let's say, professional TikTok influencers. The Tesla Arc Bitcoin Biotech Risk Cluster. I've been trading since high school and it was a really interesting way for me to fill out my decision making frameworks and to think about thinking. And I think that the more that we can have people thinking about finance, the better that we're going to progress as a society, I think it's a huge gap in our educational system. If you're going to buy an option for stock, you can just go up. It's a call. So think about like this. I made the options video where I was like options are just like shopping. Rumor has it that this pal is about to go up in price. So if I come in tomorrow, can I still buy it at the price? And a ton of women just like attacked that video and we're like, you explain things so much better than my boyfriend or my professor or like, I could sit and listen to you all day and I was like, the, this is what I was looking for. TikTok's algorithm does not reward common measured videos about responsible investing. It rewards this watch this video for 30 seconds and you'll be rich for the rest of your life. I try not to say the a word, the a L G O word because TikTok listens to us. The algorithm does impact how you feel. You know, you do notice which videos do better versus which videos do worse. How do you catch some attention in less than 60 seconds? And how do you make it something that they're like, I need this in my life. It's nearly impossible to do that in 60 seconds, but the people who perfect it are the people that you're going to watch and give us a stick around. And where people are sticking around, read it and it's nearly countless subreddits about finance. And by far.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,576,2022-11-18 15:52:27
17963," And where people are sticking around, Reddit. And it's nearly countless subreddits about finance. And by far, the biggest one of those is Wall Street Bets. There's a lot of social media platforms out there, but Reddit is like the social media platform for finance. Places like Wall Street Bets is where it all goes down. Started in January 2012, it wasn't long before Wall Street Bets adopted a 4-chain-like etiquette, leading to their tagline, like 4-chain, Founda Bloomberg Terminal. We had all these unexplained stockings, and we would be grasping for a wide stock XYZ jumped 20% in a day. And you would look at Wall Street Bets, and you would see people there talking about buying options in that stock, and it sort of squared the circle, so to speak, and started making sense. And it was at that point that it was like, wow, we have to start paying attention to this. Some people on the platform really spend tons of time, and others are just looking for entertainment, and to have a little bit of fun, effectively gambling, or looking for an outlet, trying to make a little bit of money. Then on top of all of that, there were stimulus checks now clearly this money is going to people who need to use that, to eat, to live, but there are a lot of people who use this money to invest in the stock market. And it's not just stock tips. People quote unquote, yolo, their entire life savings, or stimulus checks on a single stock. They post what is called gain and loss porn, screen grabbing staggering hits and misses on stocks for the entire community to see. I am about to lose everything. And while some of the people on Wall Street Bets are novice investors, the community contains multitudes. In one respect, what it did show us among these network groups, is they are very sophisticated. They're not a bunch of ignorant people talking to other ignorant people. And this is where the pieces of the puzzle all come together to reach havoc on Wall Street for a solid week in early 2021. It's pretty clear that the combination of more people having retail brokerage accounts and trading apps, and more people being stuck at home looking for some kind of entertainment and some kind of community online, came together in this very singular way. What came together is GameStop. Let's go back to the beginnings of what happened with GameStop a couple of years ago. On the boards like Reddit and Stock Twits, a lot of people were talking about GameStop as being attractive value. Some of them are even, you know, Wall Street alums who left the industry and now still have access to tools that they can use to improve their financial wellbeing and make very good decisions. And I think Warring Kitty is a perfect example of that. GameStop is one of the most compelling asymmetric opportunities in the market today. Really, I don't understand how you can disagree with that. At the same time that this crowd was talking it up, the hedge fund institutional crowd didn't like the stock at all. And it had the largest short interest of any stock in the New York Stock Exchange going into late 2020. Short selling is a bet that a stock price will fall and it's a fairly simple concept. An investor borrows a stock and then sells it. The investor is betting on buying the stock back later for a lower price before returning it to the original owner pocketing the price difference. What a short seller would tell you is that they almost act as a policeman in financial markets or they're at least looking for companies that aren't what they say they are. And that can range anywhere from an outright fraud that some short sellers try to expose to just a company that's not worth as much as investors think it is. The problem is if the stock price rises, the short seller has to come up with the money to buy the stock back. And the more it rises, the more it costs. And that's what's called a short squeeze. And the hedge fund Melvin Capital was on the wrong end of that squeeze. Melvin Capital lost over 50% of its money in the month of January alone just from being caught in the short squeeze of the stock. This is where the disruption comes in. One of the most wild stories you're ever going to see GameStop shares absolutely going nuts. In less than a year, the company's stock has jumped from less than $3 a share to almost $3.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,577,2022-11-18 15:56:53
17964," Less than a year, the company's stock has jumped from less than $3 a share to almost $350. Cheers everybody! Rory and Kitty has turned $50,000 or so investment into some $14 million. Investors all over social media use the free trading app Robinhood to wreak havoc on Wall Street. They're actually piling on into some of these stocks to really hurt the professional short sellers. And they all used Reddit, Twitter, TikTok and Discord to tell one another to keep buying and quote, hold the line and not sell GameStop. People are getting cheerleaded for jumping in, buying at the highs, they're saying keep going. And it was working too, until. Thursday morning, the trading app Robinhood sent out this tweet. In light of current market volatility, we are restricting transactions, including GameStop. People were really angry. Robinhood was supposed to allow the regular people to play the same game these big boys are playing. But instead, we were all taken for schmucks and they screwed us. Shares of GameStop are jumping again now that retail investors are being allowed to buy shares of the stock. What we learned is that when people organize online, they have the ability to disrupt the market. And it was a big sign that ivory rolls up institution, art is powerful. It's maybe the institution's left them to be. I don't know if pumping out GameStop was the best use of billions of dollars, but I think that as a signal to society, it was pretty interesting and powerful. The GameStop saga was so impactful that both Vlad Tenev and Rorynkitty were called into testify before Congress to clarify each of their roles in the saga. One thing that's emerged from the congressional hearings is that they're interested in how retail brokerages make money and whether they're keeping the vast interest of their customers in mind. And it's pretty fuzzy as far as what they would actually do as a result. While the frenzy around GameStop eventually subsided, it didn't take long for retail investors to find other areas to invest their money. Take a look at Bitcoin going bananas over the weekend. Bitcoin forms a brand new all-time high. It was after GameStop started to drop that we saw Bitcoin really go up to over 60,000. How much further does this rally have to run? It's compelling to say that money shifted from one venue to the other. While correlation doesn't equal causation, there's a chart out there showing an inverse correlation on meme stocks going down and cryptocurrencies going up. There's definitely an aspect where people are making money on stocks and then moving, you know, they're agnostic, they're not hedge funds, they can invest wherever the hell they want. It's a classic sort of momentum trade they're going to wherever the winners are and they're willing to jump on and, you know, ride it. So whether it's meme stocks like GameStop, meme coins like Dogecoin are entirely new ways to invest in art like NFTs, the new kind of retail investor is making its presence known. Over the next 10, maybe 15 years, you're going to continue to see whether by choice or by force, that baton go from older generations to younger generations. I don't think any single app is going to be the thing that disrupts. I think people are the disruptors. How people get ideas about what to invest in has become increasingly entwined with social media and as social media companies govern more and more of our lives, the fact that now they're tied in more intimately to people's wallets is something that we might want to understand better. Usually what disruption I think means is technology comes in whether it's blogs to the newspapers or online, retailing to brick and mortar. They come in and they're in the same business, but they just do it in such a gigantic cost savings that it causes everybody to switch. Well, that's the risk that happens here is that it's so much cheaper to just manage your whole home.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,578,2022-11-18 16:01:20
17965," The end to cost savings, that it causes everybody to switch. Well, that's the risk that happens here is that it's so much cheaper to just manage your own money. We're not there yet, but costs and conveniences are moving in that direction. So I'd say, Wall Street, you haven't been disrupted yet, but you could be in the coming years, and that the final chapter on this story hasn't been written. Meet Bloomberg's own David Nicholson. Now, his happy place is out in the field, on the open road. But like the rest of the world lately, he's been working from home a lot more than he's used to. COVID-19 has prompted a massive urban exodus, as professionals of every ilk, yearn for more space to live and work. As a result, rural areas have exploded, and they're poised to experience a resurgence, as more and more families pack up and leave the big city to try out life in the berms. But there's one problem with that. Not all internet speeds are created equal. Anyone who might need to upload or download large files for a living may not want to pack up and move to that cabin in the woods just yet. Now, David's house isn't a cabin, but it is in the woods, and inexplicably, his internet is workable. My internet is okay. I pay a lot for it. It's around $140 a month. The download speed is great, and the upload speed is terrible, which is really bad for my work, because I have to upload these massive files. But I'm definitely one of the more lucky ones in this community. Just a few miles down the road, my buddy, has awful internet. It's usually under two down and under point two up. So it's often unusable. Some days it's around one, and other times it'll drop down to about point two, point three. I just want to be able to have internet at my house without having to go outside the normal ways of acquiring internet. It's really frustrating. We're literally miles, a few miles away from downtown, and it just cuts off. This is a problem, and the solutions are not there yet. Because getting high speed internet and rural areas on mass is something our providers may simply not be ready for. If your internet service doesn't have fast download and upload speeds, then you don't have high speed harmony. You have. Americans on average pay about $70 a month for internet at home. But in rural areas, it could cost a lot more for a lot less service. So the pricing for a fixed wireless provider here can be something between $80 and $150 for about 25 megabits per second. However, Gigabit service, which is a thousand megabits per second, and symmetrical, is running at about 119 a month through 130 a month. That's John Paul. He co-owns Spiral Fiber, an internet service provider here in Nevada County, California. And for the past 10 years, he's been trying to bring an affordable fiber optic network to town. It all started when he applied to be part of the pilot program for Google's fiber service. Across the country, civic boosters have been going to extremes, chanting, singing, and marching, trying to get the search engine giant to look at their town. The internet these days is crucial to be in the world, to be a part of the world, and to be connected to your community. Google ultimately went with Kansas City, Missouri, which left Paul unemissioned.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,579,2022-11-18 16:05:28
17966," is crucial to be in the world, to be a part of the world, and to be connected to your community. Google ultimately went with Kansas City, Missouri, which left Paul on a mission to get funding to lay out fiber-aptic networks for Gigabit service. Over the next several years, he would attend conferences and pitch venture capitalists and apply for grants to make his vision come to life. One of the biggest roadblocks to building infrastructure for the Internet here in the United States are the existing large providers. They have their landstaked out. They would prefer that nobody come in and compete against them. In 2013, we applied for a grant. We went down and met with the commissioners at the California Public Utilities Commission. It was an arduous process to get funded, but we finally did against all odds. We got a $16 million grant and then we went out to seek venture capital. Then in March of 2020, the pandemic hit the world. Everybody got locked down and everybody came home and everybody started using the Internet. I remember seeing on one of the local fixed wireless providers websites, they said, hey, we know you're all staying home, but please don't use too much video and please don't use too much bandwidth. I thought that doesn't work. The US connectivity gap is far greater compared to countries that are considered its peers economically. Some developing nations actually have better internet than rural America. Like in Kenya, which has a state-of-the-art fiber optic network fed in from their coastline. The American connectivity gap does largely affect rural areas that are either outside of service coverage or simply prohibitively expensive. This is Rebecca. She and her family moved to Nevada County just a couple miles down the road from David. They took for granted that high-speed internet would just exist in the area and it's not something they even bothered to check on before buying their house. Turns out, all they got was dial-up. We wanted to move where we had a little more space, room for the kids to run around, either just be out in the mountains a little bit more. Having come from a bigger city area where Wi-Fi is pretty readily available, we hadn't really considered that in our purchasing of the house, whether that would be an option or not. When school started and now that we are remote learning with our children and we're doing everything from home, we didn't have the option to do that at our house. So every day when school would start, we'd have to pack the kids up and we'd go to my in-law home. They have a little cabin up in this area that does have Wi-Fi already. Rebecca's situation is the norm in rural America. According to data from the Federal Communications Commission, just 4% of urban Americans lack access to broadband internet. That's compared to almost 40% of people who live in rural areas. While that was the case, there were also racial and socioeconomic divides in terms of who had that access. In addition to that geographic difference, low-income African-American students, Latino students, and first generation of college students were more likely than others to have only one device at home that shared among multiple siblings and or lack access to that actual connection. For most American towns, there's also a lack of competition forcing internet prices up. And large providers like AT&T and Comcast aren't incentivized to expand service to these rural communities. This is how Xfinity makes life simple, easy, awesome. So in our area, we have a small imprint of Comcast, but they're not going to go out to the more rural areas. It's just not cost-effective for them to do it as a large company. In order to lay fiber cable, you're actually physically digging trenches into the ground. And for internet service providers, they're primarily focused on maximizing their profits. And so the fewer customers you have in any square mile on the more fiber you have to lay, that's just kind of harder to pencil out from a purely economic standpoint. AT&T released a statement on the matter, expressing the need and desire for government assistance to fund fiber optic expansion to areas deemed unprofitable. Comcast released a similar statement encouraging more public-private collaboration on this effort. Federal agencies do offer grants to help communities build broadband networks, but many have argued that there's not enough flexibility on how to use these funds. The COVID-19 relief package passed by Congress in March and signed by President Donald Trump awarded $43.3 million to 51 projects on the East Coast alone. But it...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,580,2022-11-18 16:09:54
17967," Passed by Congress in March and signed by President Donald Trump awarded $43.3 million to 51 projects on the East Coast alone. But it also stipulated that these projects needed to be up and running by December 30. For contractors who plan projects months and years in advance, it's a scramble to rearrange their schedules to meet that deadline. So what we've been asking the federal government to consider is at least as long as the projects are getting started, knowing the projects are being put into place to expand both remote learning, working from home and opportunities like that that are truly driven from COVID. We're moving as fast as we can regardless, but hopefully they'll give us some more time. Talking to John Paul, it's clear that he believes broadband is something that can transform a community and should be considered a public good. One of the first communities to come on in the United States with full on gigabit service was Chattanooga, Tennessee. Now they're a bigger city, but there is a city that was economically in a downturn. In the last 15 years, the city of Chattanooga has turned around in an amazing way. It's a nexus for young people to move to. It's a place where technology happens. It's not just about logging on to Zoom, to connect with your colleagues who might be in New York City. It's also your ability as a small business, operating in the town of Nevada City or wherever it may be to quickly upload your payroll documents or something onto the cloud or to quickly swipe a customer's credit card. There's just some really basic business functions and mechanics that I think people in big cities really take for granted and that are just going to be a much bigger challenge for small business owners and rural areas. One two, one two, one two, five things, eight, seven things. Ten ships, ten ships, ten ships. Ten ships. Historically, the marginalized people, you call them as untouchables or dhaliths, they have been kept away from the center of the knowledge. Once you are born into a caste, it is very difficult for you to grow beyond that. You are stuck in that identity. Education is the best way of liberating them. So that's how I chose to work in education sector. The kind of education that we are giving to the marginalized people is going to change not just the fate of these communities in Telangana but it is going to be the source of inspiration, the source of hope for all the marginalized in this country. For generations of Indians, the social code known as the caste system has defined how people earn a living and whom they marry. Although outlawed seven decades ago, caste remain a significant factor in deciding everything, from family ties and cultural traditions to educational and economic opportunities. Dalits, people who are on the lowest rank of the caste system, constitute almost 1-5th of India's population of 1.3 billion. Not able to afford the high tuition.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,581,2022-11-18 16:14:19
17968," The caste system constitute almost 1-5th of India's population of 1.3 billion. Not able to afford the high tuition of private schools, many are forced to attend government-funded institutions, which in the past have suffered from poor infrastructure, lower education standards, and high student-to-teacher ratios. But Dr. Pravine Kumar is trying to change that. I am currently working as head of the Langan or social welfare residential schools. So totally, above 400 schools I manage, these are all residential schools for the students who are historically marginalized but talented than poor. Of them, 60% are girls and then 40% are boys, because girls are more marginalized among them marginalized. They voices are always suppressed. My approach to improve the conditions in the schools has been put your eyes and ears on the ground always. Stock to the parents, stock to the teachers, stock to the students, stay in the schools, and then understand their problems, their challenges, both in classrooms and then the corridors and the dorms. Then go to the dining halls and see what kind of food they are eating, and then go to their homes and then what kind of food they are getting. And what kind of challenges the parents have. One of the important changes that I brought in after I took over was to complete the transformation of mother tongue to English medium, because English medium, as I said, English is the language of emancipation and language that connects you to the whole body of knowledge in the world. So, we had to train a lot of teachers. Identity is extremely important. There is a scientific evidence to prove that, you are sense of identity is extremely crucial to your growth as a successful human being in your life. If you accept an identity which is very humiliating, which reminds you of very painful past, I think that identity will not help you to grow. I am not saying that you should forget your past. I am not saying that, but that should not be the bubble in which you must live always. Sweros is an alternative identity. S stands for state, W stands for welfare, Aero, SW and then Aero is Swero. So, the idea is that your dreams have to be skybound. So, that is what we are trying to achieve by changing the identities. Like, you know, you say, I am a Swero and I aim to be a doctor. I am a Swero. I aim to be a top-notch engineer. I am a Swero. I aim to be a top bureaucrat of this country. I am a Swero. I want to be a very good actor or musician in this world. So, these are the positive images that are associated with identity. Just to give an example to you. See, in 2012, in our institution, we used to produce about six doctors per year. But because of our, you know, this self-eliberating ideology of Sweroism, we have this year, we have produced about 189 doctors. This is phenomenal for any purists of the poor people. You know, how difficult it is to get into a medical college, in this country. So, but today, because of this ideology, the students have been able to achieve this, you know, fetus. Pujita has been a form-lebror. Her parents, the angels, are agricultural labourers.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,582,2022-11-18 16:18:28
17969," Pujita has been a form labourer and a parent's, the angels are agricultural labourers and then this girl used to sell vegetables but thanks to the residential education institutions she came to the Gowlido de campus and then she toiled very hard for one year despite many problems and today I am so happy to share with you that you know she has joined one of the prestigious medical colleges in the state of Telangana, Usman in medical college and then in future she hopes to be a gynecologist so this is the journey our children are hoping for similarly the Mount Everest expansion. Mount Everest expansion we are very fortunate enough to place the youngest ever female in the history of this world on the peak of Mount Everest. How did this happen? It's all because of an ideology that helps you to liberate yourself. We have a lot of extra-curricular activities and most of them got institutionalized now so for example music. Similarly the games we have so many coaching academy, boxing academy, Brazilian academy, we have handball academy so we have you know Kabadi that traditional Indian sport. We have gold, we have introduced gold falls like gold fees generally played by so-called rich people but today even poorest of the poor people also are being trained in gold in our schools. So our intention has been to give all 360 degrees you know type of opportunities to the students so that you know whoever is interested in whatever activity they can go and then do it. Break the barriers, break the fence at least mentally because the poor people have been programmed to be victims, programmed to be subjugated, programmed to be on the margins always, programmed to feel inferior we wanted to change all that. There are certain games which are exclusive to rich people, there are certain languages which are exclusive to middle class and upper middle class in this country to put it in one world. The sole aim of introducing all these co-curricular activities is to break the stereotypes which are recklessly involved on these people. Their stereotypes Dr. Kumano's all too well. Born a Dalit his grandparents were labourers and access to the village well was restricted. Dr. Kumano credits his parents belief in the power of education with helping him realize his aspirations. He went on to join the Indian Police Service, attended Harvard University and then began pursuing educational reforms back home. I attribute whatever I am today to my mother primarily. They educated me in the village although there were no good schools so then I stayed in social welfare hostels, hostels which are managed by government for the poorest of the poor kids. I passed with you know reasonably good grades then I went to university and then I faced a worst form of discrimination in the universities like and there were you know in those days I am talking about so the bathrooms and the you know toilets were exclusive meant for shoulder costs and she will try. I used to fight discrimination on one hand and then again you know try to excel in academics you know day in and day out. So that's how I came to education because I deeply believe that education is the only important weapon that can really you know place the poorest of the poor people from a very victimhood orbit to prosperous orbit. I think in future this is going to be a game changer for the marginalized in this country. Oh",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,583,2022-11-18 16:22:55
17970," If you look at a thermal image of a city and then compare that to a map of vegetation, you'll find that where there's greenery, the temperature is lower. That's because things like asphalt, concrete and shingled roofs absorb more heat from the sun than trees. This is the urban heat island effect, and it accounts for higher temperatures in cities, often by several degrees compared with their surroundings. It's becoming a huge risk to human health as growing urban populations exacerbate the heating effects of climate change. Heat waves kill more people than any other extreme weather event, more than tornadoes, hurricanes and even floods. That's why urban heat island mitigation strategies are being studied in Singapore by a group of researchers. The government-backed project called Cooling Singapore is now in the process of combining everything they've learnt to create a digital tool that can help cities all over the world, starting with Singapore. In Singapore, close to the equator, temperatures regularly rise above 32 degrees Celsius or 90 degrees Fahrenheit, and the city structures only make it worse. That is also the case for Singapore, which is basically a concrete jungle, more urbanized, more developed city. Even in Singapore, what you have is a situation whereby there's a temperature difference of 7 degrees Celsius between the more urbanized and the more rural areas. The government has taken drastic steps to keep temperatures down. This is Gardens by the Bay, an award-winning park, and inside this greenhouse is a pleasant 24 degrees. That's because the dome, along with two dozen nearby towers full of thousands of people, is chilled by what's probably the world's largest underground district cooling system. It uses a large central plant for cool water and then pipes it into banks, residential towers, an exhibition centre, shopping malls, and the city's iconic Marina Bay Sands hotel and casino complex. So one of the biggest perks of using this system for the buildings is that they can save 40% in terms of electricity usage compared to your traditional air conditioners. And with Singapore relying on natural gas for most of its power, this new system means emission savings equivalent to removing 10,000 cars from the city's roads. That has big implications for the rest of the world. If things stay as they are, more than a third of the world's electricity could end up being used to cool buildings and vehicles by 2050. As the world gets hotter, gets warmer, there is a greater need for air conditioning and as well as refrigerators for instance. And the more people are buying these household appliances, the more energy usage they use and they release heat more and that then exacerbates climate change. It's a vicious circle and so since 2017, researchers at cooling Singapore have been identifying design solutions that reduce our need for so much cool air in the first place. One thing many cities have in common and that's the importance of vegetation. That's a very important measure to mitigate the earthen heat.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,584,2022-11-18 16:27:15
17971," One thing many cities have in common and that's the importance of vegetation. That's a very important measure to mitigate the urban heat because of the shading effect of course and the psychological effects of the vegetation and also because of the possible evaporative cooling effect of the vegetation. Vegetation can be of course on the ground floor in form of trees and shrubs and you can walk under them. This is the so called canopy layer that the vegetation forms above us. But vegetation can also go up the fasades of buildings and it can go to the roof of the buildings. Luckily Singapore has been striving for the garden city feel for quite some time. It was a vision initially introduced by them Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yu in 1967 to make life more pleasant for people. And today Singapore is one of the world's greenest cities in terms of urban vegetation. Campong Abmalty, a community centre that contains health facilities and social spaces, now provides more green space than the plot of land it was originally built on. It's topped by a roof scape of staggered terraces covered in local plants which functions as a community park. And a village green in the centre that contains farm plots for residents to tend to. Park Royal on Pickering was designed as a hotel in a garden that doubled the green growing potential of its site. There's now 15,000 metres of sky gardens, reflecting pools, waterfalls, plantar terraces and green walls. And the government has big plans as well. Singapore actually has a plan to plan 1 million trees and add more green spaces over the next 10 years. It is actually a mix of one thing to reduce the urban hit island effect. But on the other hand is also to get the people to be more connected to nature. But it's not enough. The city state has still been warming twice as quickly as the world average over the past six decades. That's why calling Singapore has developed a catalogue of other potential heat mitigation measures. When you try to mitigate your hit island effect in a city or in any building in a village as well, the first place to start is by shading off the windows. You have to keep areas clear so that the wind can move through it. Water of a certain depth can act as a very good thermal buffer. If you have to construct heavy buildings such as high rises, at least you can make the surface the facade less heavy and you can protect it from direct sun penetration. You have to make sure that no combustion engines will be in the city in the middle and the medium to long term range. So ideally the electricity production is outside of the city and you bring just the clean electricity into the city. You cannot at least minimize the use of energy in the city. And you can start to slowly convert the roofs, the facades of the city into production areas for renewable energy. In Singapore unfortunately this is a limited option but in the long run it could produce up to 20-25% of the energy of the electricity needed in Singapore. If all the roofs and the areas in the buildings on the buildings on the facades would be used to do that. With so many different ideas, cooling Singapore is also designing a virtual model of the city to test them out. It's called a digital urban climate twin or duct that will calculate how each element of the city's design will impact the urban heat island effect. That means we model not only the geometry of the buildings digitally but also we model the transportation, the insulation, the temperature, the radiation coming from the sun, the weather, the local weather, the local climate, the even very, very micro climate of the city. The water, the movement of people.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,585,2022-11-18 16:31:26
17972," whether the local weather, the local climate, the even very, very microclimate of the city, the water, the movement of people in the city, we can invent scenarios, we can design scenarios, test them before we actually build them, and if they test very well, and we are sure that they will function, then we can start to build them and put them into reality. Singapore will be using this new tool to figure out which actions it should take next, and the model can be applied to any city, whether it needs to keep heat out or keep heat in, which will ultimately save energy, slow climate change, and improve our quality of life. So this is something that Singapore will be able to export, maybe even together with its city development systems that it already has. Singapore is one of the very few cities in the world that really combine this scientific approach with a very well established urban redesign and urban design approach through its agencies and the combination of its agencies. It has achieved a lot in the past. If it keeps following the scientific path and the combination with the other knowledge in the city already, we think that it will be a very comfortable and very livable city in the future, even more than today. Times are tough, jobs are scarce, it's risky to be outside and around others. It seems like there's very few ways to make extra money during a pandemic. So I guess I'll just hunker down and binge social media until this all blows over. Wait, don't these people make money? How do these people make money? Streamers, YouTubers, Twitch stars, how do they make money? Is it a lot? Is it a lot of work? I know, I gotta ask somebody in the biz and I got just the guy, Austin John plays. This is your full-time job now, right? As of November of last year, yes. This was always just kind of like a side thing. Like any money that I made from doing my videos and whatever else, I never touched that because I didn't really think of that as being like real money. And then it started coming in more and more. And then it was like, I hit my first day that I broke a grand and I was like, this is actually gonna be money. How did the YouTube channel come to be? When the game Pokemon Sun and Moon came out for the 3DS, there was like things that I learned about the game and then I wanted to just share that information with people. And at the time, I didn't have any way to capture or screen or anything, so I found like generic footage and I kind of put it all together with so much editing. And that video got six views. And then two days later, I made another one. And that one got 12 views. And then I just started pumping out more and more content and people were like, this guy knows what he's talking about. It really just started building on top of itself and then it was like, my channel really focuses on tips and tricks. So I play a straight 18 hours. And I'll finish the game or get to about the 40 hour mark. And then I'll make my first...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,586,2022-11-18 16:35:47
17973," This is on tips and tricks, so I play a straight 18 hours and I'll finish the game or get to about the 40 hour mark. And then I'll make my first video. While I'm going through, I have a giant no pad and just scribbles everywhere and I make these notes of like the things that stumped me. So I know the things that may stump other people. Uh, what do you need to think about if you're building your YouTube channel? One, you need to do something that you're passionate about. Not that you like, not that you think you're going to make money on something you're passionate about. This other thing is something that other people are passionate about. It holds a special place to them. And third is, it needs to be something that people are going to seek out information on. In order to enter into the marketplace, you either need to be better than everyone else. You either need to be faster than everyone else, or you need to be more accessible than everyone else. And you can't be more accessible because it's already on the platform granted. If you understand how the algorithm works, which is very similar to Google Analytics, then yeah, you can have a little bit of a head start. But if you're not doing it faster and if you're not doing it better than everyone else, then why should in one watch your channel? So my income as a YouTuber kind of breaks down to three different ways. One, which is the bulk of it, which is ad revenue. Whenever you go and you watch a video and then there's an ad and then you wait five seconds and hit the bottom right corner. And then you go on to the next video or a non-skippable ad or the video starts immediately. You get the little banner ads at the bottom or if you scroll down from the video, the first thing that shows there is an ad. Those are the four different types of ads that can appear on every single YouTube video. And all of them pay a certain amount. It varies on lots of things like the country of the person who posted the country of the person who watches it. The time of year where you are in the quarter. If there's anything going on with a reduction in ad revenue, like great example, COVID-19, companies weren't as spending as much on advertising. So because of that, CPM went down. CPM stands for a click per thousand and using the Roman numeral for a thousand. And that means that for every one thousand views, you get a certain amount of money. Now on low ads, when I first started off, my CPM was 30 cents. So every thousand views, I made 30 cents. But then once I signed with an MCN and I started making more quality content and more engaging content, some of my better videos and certain times of the year, I can see CPMs as high as 12 to $14. And there's a big fluctuation between, you know, if I post a video, when there's no ads being spent like January and February, that's a reason a lot of your favorite YouTubers and also TV shows don't post new videos in that time of year. Because ad rates are down. Why are they going to make content then? Instead, you're recording and you're bulking up for when ad revenue is higher. The second way that a YouTuber makes income is support, crowdfunding, things like that. When I first started off, Patreon was really the only option. But then they started rolling out supporters and members for YouTube channels. So whenever I have a live stream, you can click a button and then you could become a member and then you get special icons next to your name. I believe they're called badges or on any video. You can hit the join button and that helps support the channel. And then the third aspect of that would be merch. And for me, my merch has been somewhat basic. In fact, I'm wearing one of my t-shirts from last year right now. You have to endure the times that your first video gets six views. That you post it on Reddit and they say shut up and then an auto mod bans you. You have to go through that because until you go through that and you discover why you're doing it. You're not doing it for other people. You're doing it for yourself. If you're not loving what you do, then it's not worth it. Huh. So make a channel about something that I'm passionate about. Oh, sweet. I guess I can make the channel about that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,587,2022-11-18 16:40:12
17974," I guess I can make the channel about that. Now, how do I grow an audience? How do I get popular? It's all about diversification. You have to have a massive Twitter following. You have to have a massive Instagram following. You have to have a massive YouTube following. Of course, you have to be on Twitch, which is the key platform. But basically, anyway, you can get in front of your audience. You can engage with your audience. It is going to drive those clicks, which ultimately drives the advertiser revenue that you get back from all of these platforms. It's me and Dan playing video games and talking in a funny manner over them. They're not just people who are good at games. They're actually people who are good at online engagement, online entertainment, first and foremost. You have to write to remain stylish. Anything you wear can and will be used against you in the quarter fashion. The streamer is either very, very talented at the game. The best player in the game is generally going to draw a crowd because people like watching people who are very good. On the other hand, they're either very, very good or funny, charismatic, whatever it is on that side. Oh, no! It becomes more of a show where they talk about other things outside of the gaming world and gaming becomes really just a backdrop and an excuse to engage with our audience. There were those weird Ronald McDonalds, straight to VHS movies. You remember those? I was like, I'm a little chatty. I would kind of, you know, when boring things were happening in the game, I would ramble on about, you know, movies I'd watched or books I'd read or conversations I'd had and stuff like that. So I think being personable was a big part of that. It's not just getting on and playing games. It's getting on and being an entertainer. You are putting on a show. All right, now let me go ahead and grab the samurai sword that every gym has. Okay, he's dead. A larger audience and to have that audience, I think, stay with you. You have to bring something extra. You have to find your niche. You have to find what works and what connects with the audience and what makes them laugh and what makes them keep coming back. You've got to make it a little more exciting. All right? Throwing a hanging bishop. Have everybody in suspense for a moment. I think the real most important thing is to just get used to being on camera. Like in any sort of performance thing is get used to talking on camera. You know, my first few videos were terrible. But because I sat down and did it for six to eight hours a day, I just got used to talking and I got over that uncomfortable hump. If you go into Twitch, purely with the expectation that you're going to make money, make a job out of it, have all this growth and it's going to be great, you're probably going to burn out prior to getting to that point. Because there's very little payoff for a long time, right? Like multiple years generally before you really start to see a payoff. And so, you know, those first few times you're streaming, nobody is there. One person shows up every 30 minutes says, hi, maybe, and leaves, right? Like, it's very discouraging, I think, for a lot of people. And so, you have to be there just loving it, you have to love talking to yourself when nobody is around, you have to love just the game that you're playing, all of that stuff, because it takes a while and I think a majority of people burn out prior to getting to the like profitable point of it. And there you have it, my very own YouTube, Twitch, Discord, and streaming channels all ready to go live. It's a veritable social media ecosystem just on the verge of thriving. So, don't forget to smash like and subscribe and visit my Patreon for perks. Also, go to my merch page. And one last thing, stay cool, my friends.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,588,2022-11-18 16:44:31
17975," VOS The The mountains The mountains The mountains Mountains would This is live stream shopping, one of the hottest trends in China. Every night, tens of millions of people watch live shows hosted by influencers like VIA and by the products they recommend. On e-commerce and social apps like Taobao and Do-In, the sister app of TikTok. It's not about only shopping, it's about the experience, it's about having fun. You gotta see 3D, you gotta see in some kind of action, it's almost like a theatre act. The internet craze has taken over China. By the end of 2020, the country had almost 400 million live stream shopping users. China's live stream e-commerce market has also grown dramatically, with an estimated value of $161 billion in 2020. It's becoming popular outside China as well. So it's live streaming the future of shopping. Live streaming is not a new thing, and China is started in 2015 with the rollout of 4G, and it was first used for entertainment and socializing. Many live streamers perform for their followers or chat it to them, making money by receiving virtue currency and gifts. In the west, live streaming is mainly the domain of avid gamers. In China, it's broken into e-commerce. China actually has a very big e-commerce empire, so it uses these super apps, what we call that. You have payment, you have search of information, you have recommendation system, and you have huge amount of goods available on the platform, and as well as a lot of consumers. So with this advantage, they merge these features of live streaming to make the influencers actually sell goods. Here is a perfect choice, nice neutrals, beautiful prints, nothing overwhelming, and the warmth and comfort of flannel. Traditional TV shopping involves a one-way direction whereby a host introduces a product, demonstrates, and they call this number or something. But live stream shopping is live. That in itself is a very big difference. They call this different psychology, and live stream shopping is a very entertaining way of engaging someone else. When you shop, actually this live streaming video will continue. It will minimize into a corner, and you can buy the items and pay all on the same app. After that, the live streaming screen will just enlarge by itself, and the promoter will come back to screen. So it's like very convenient. How about one of China's biggest e-commerce platforms owned by tech giant Alibaba added a live streaming function in early 2016. In the following years, other e-commerce and social platforms like JD and Do-ing also integrated this feature. During eastern qi hip to coin does a huge amount of prices, with a chiffon on the couch and the shelf, can it actually have a great承adi joint, which is this nearby spoon. Kadokai, or the",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,589,2022-11-18 16:49:26
17976," The Kakao Zai, which we are talking about, is not only the number of users or the number of people who are in the market, but also the number of people who are in the market, but it's almost impossible to get a breakthrough at this point in recent years. Over $70 billion worth of goods was sold by a live stream on Taobao in the years from March 2021. Latest surveys showed that over 60% of live stream users in China were charging shopping shows. And over 65% of them shopped at least once via live stream. In 2020, live stream shopping got a huge boost during the pandemic. With millions of people were in lockdown and many retailers were pushed online. People during the lockdown felt like there's a need for more social interactions. This live platform creates an interesting environment that these people desecrate that are actually interacting with you. And then the live stream shopping brings in a lot more variety of things that people could buy and satisfy in a sense of like losing control especially during the pandemic. At the heart of this craze are the top influencers who have tens of millions of followers and sub-products worth millions of dollars every night. They often use their stop power to get bargains from retailers, which in turn boosts their own sales and influence. So if you think about China's live streaming, you have to know the king and queen of the influencers. The queen of live streaming via she is actually having the biggest viewership and the biggest sales volume for a long time on top of a platform. She can sell everything from like Gucci sunglasses, lipstick, homes and cars. One time she offered her followers to go on a Tesla ride with her and she even for once. So they rocky launch in her live streaming room for 40 million yuan. The king was Li Jiaqi, more widely known as lipstick's brother. He used to be a cosmetic sales before he turned into live streaming commerce. And he knows a lot about the cosmetics. So he's the one that will actually put the lipstick on himself when he's on the show. Top live streamers like VIA and Li Jiaqi have become celebrities in China and earn millions of dollars a year. Although not everyone can be as popular, mid-breaking live streamers like Tiffany still and a good income through sales commissions. They want to grow There for 6 months then the investment is key. This line of process and other events will be fair in this line, at the end. That will give步 to whatever crisis everyone has. Host Mantula, I think in short life and what will be a lot of possible development is a deal. I think the idea of petition is not师ing in our own锋to. I think petition is just a nuance for our relationships. successful live streamers are generally very good at communication. They are very good at articulating very simply what a product that's what a product doesn't do. In order for them to sell, they need to be trustworthy and appear trustworthy and they need to show in some ways that they're authentic, right? So, for Vía and Lichaci, they are able to articulate that quite a bit through their body language, through what they say. For example, Lichaci will always, you know, sometimes say things, bad things about certain products because to him, there's his honest opinion and sometimes people want to hear that. And so, they seem very credible, they seem very trustworthy and don't forget, they're also very entertaining and very interesting. If you're familiar with Lichaci, you want a generous record for like the most lipstick applications to models in 30 seconds. So, if you're able to create a lot of bars, you're going to think just things that you do. People who meet up.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,590,2022-11-18 16:54:14
17977," the applications to models in a 30 seconds. So if you're able to create a lot of bus, you're going to just think things that you do. People who may not want to buy lipsticks but also streaming just to watch what he does. And then from there, you might get hooked to just an e-buying or a central manager or to the company. And so... Life streamers also use sales techniques such as limited time or supply. These sense of scarcity can often encourage viewers to buy. The platform in itself creates and enhances some of these things. But you see it live. Something we call social proof as taken over, meaning that, hey, other people are interested, other people are joining in, other people want the same product. And they add it in the chat and they ask questions. And they say, oh, I want this too. What happens then? It makes the whole product even more scarce. But it's not just influencers, local farmers, luxury brands, even mutual funds, have also started their own livestream shows. Working with very top-tier live streamers can be risky. It's not necessary that the benefits will end up with a brand. So we see company executives opening their own shows. And we see like PNG have their own sales room which runs shows every day as well. We also have local governments in small towns to sell their agricultural products. So the live streaming is definitely transformed the way product owners can think about how to reach their consumers. And enables a lot of players to actually sell. And live stream shopping is going global. Merchants in Southeast Asia have embraced this trend. And in the West, Amazon has upgraded its live streaming function, adding interactive features like chat rooms, companies including Google and Facebook are also developing and investing in technologies to integrate video and e-commerce. In fact, the live streaming has started and the future development space and potential are all huge. Next, we will be more and more content-wise. It will become a more daily conversation and more exciting. If you look at the numbers alone, their numbers alone, the number of people, the number of people, you know that they can sell and you know that they can generate revenue. Are they able to sustain it over a long period of time? It depends on how you know very they are at changing some of the things that they do. But you can't expect consumers one day turn into virtual shopping for good. There will be the nature of us that crave to go into the store to touch the goods and actually wear it and see how it looks like and walk around that with our friends. And those things wouldn't be replaceable with live streaming. Imagine that the oceans are actually the largest battery. We store a huge amount of energy in the oceans. The wave of motion can be very deep. It can extend down several hundred meters. It gets to the near shore from about 50 meters. The whole water column is moving backwards and forwards. As we search for waste to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels, some are looking to a largely untapped potential source of renewable energy. In theory, waves off the coast of the United States alone could generate over two trillion kilowatt hours of electricity a year, enough to power more than half of the country. The waves intensify and subside not as quickly as the wind.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,591,2022-11-18 16:57:34
17978," Two trillion kilowatt hours of electricity a year, enough to power more than half of the country. Waves intensify and subside not just quickly as the wind, and that means that it can produce a smoother power generation curve. One of the potential advantages of wave energy is that it could act as a complementary source of power compared to other renewables on the grid if it were to be scaled up to a commercial scale. For decades, engineers have been trying to convert wave energy into electricity, but a host of technological and financial challenges have complicated their efforts. In the years from around 2006 to 2015, there were a space of bankruptcies in the sector, and this was largely because of a lack of kind of continuous proven projects out at sea with reliable electricity generation. Since then, companies have been trying to develop the technologies at a steady pace and with a smaller cash burn. But the same questions remain. Can companies develop devices and technologies that actually work? Is wave energy just a novelty or something that can become a major renewable energy source? The sea is a very challenging environment within which to operate a power project. So sea water is corrosive and conditions are very rough. So this means that power projects don't have a very long lifetime and it increases operating and maintenance costs. Partly because of that, many early wave energy projects hit rough waters, such as the Pellarmus Wave Energy Converter in Portugal, and the Ila Limpit Project in Scotland. But that hasn't stopped others from trying. Companies are focused on testing projects out at sea, proving their durability, trying to raise capital and bring down cost. The sector hasn't really converged around one single technology design and companies are kind of undersided about which design works best. Finland-based AW Energy is a veteran in the sector. The first proof of concept of the company's device was made in the 90s after diver Rano Koei-Vasari observed the strong back and forth movement of a hatch cover in a shipwreck in the Baltic Sea. The waves are generated far from the coastline, so the wind blows on the surface of the water, causing the water particles to rotate. And that rotation extends deep down below the surface, and the waves can be very long. They can be several hundred meters long. And as they come into the near shore, this rotational energy turns into an elliptical energy and eventually back to the pause that you probably noticed if you've been swimming on the sea shore in large waves, you're pulled in and out. That's the energy that we're extracting. There's a sweet spot where we deploy, so around 10 to 50 meters of water depth, that's where there's still strong wave energy coming in. After years of research, prototyping and testing, the company has deployed Wave Roller, a 350 kilowatt device in the waters of Portugal. Wave Roller has an 80 meter wide and 10 meter high steel panel fixed to the seabed via a floatable foundation. The panel moves back and forth with the waves, capturing the energy. It's submerged in the depth of 15 meters, so it's protected from the extreme waves. We generate electricity by capturing the movement with hydraulic circuitry in a machine room underneath the surface. That hydraulic energy we turn to electricity with hydraulic vacuumulators and hydraulic motors and also our generator. The Wave Roller has survived large waves at sea for over a year and delivered electricity via an underwater cable to the grid in Portugal. Meanwhile, the company has won a 2.5 million euro grant to work on an upgraded version of the Wave Roller, aiming to increase the electricity.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,592,2022-11-18 17:01:51
17979," Great and Portugal. Meanwhile, the company has won a 2.5 million euro grant to work on an upgraded version of the Wave Roller, aiming to increase the electricity generation capacity to 1 megawatt. The upscale device would have a bigger panel, two power takeoff units, and improved software to control the energy production. We have taken into use a very prediction algorithm that kind of tells us what kind of waves are coming into our device. That gives us a few seconds to prepare for capturing more energy and the difference in that is significant. Our future plans are to deliver technology around the world. So I'm hoping we can be working on delivering technology to projects in Asia and also in American contents as well. Meanwhile, Israeli company EcoWavePower is taking a different approach to capturing the power of the ocean. For the company's founder in a braverment, developing new sources of renewable energy is a personal mission. I was born in Ukraine in 1986, and two weeks after I was born, the Chernobyl nuclear reactor exploded, causing the largest in history, nuclear disaster. I was one of the babies that got hurt from the negative effects of such explosion. I had a respiratory arrest and a clinical death. Luckily, my mother and nurse approached my crib on time and gave me a mouth-to-mouth resuscitation with saved my life. I got a second chance in life and decided to do something good with it. Growing up, Anna wanted to be a politician to positively change the world. After working as a translator at a renewable energy company, she decided to change parts. Solar and wind energy were fully commercialized. There were a lot of amazing technologies implemented everywhere. I saw that wave energy, although it's an immense source of electricity, the biggest companies in the world are trying to develop wave energy with no success. And there was kind of a race going on in the world of who is the company that is going to develop a viable wave energy solution first. In 2011, the then 24-year-old inner co-founded EcoWave Power. Instead of installing devices offshore, the company's devices are attached to existing breakwaters, jetties and peers. Our technology is very cost-efficient, especially in comparison to the offshore technologies, because we don't need any ships, divers, underwater mooring or cables when installing existing man-made structures. And all our expensive equipment, the generator, the hydraulic conversion unit, the automation, is located online just like a regular power station. This is the EcoWave Power conversion unit that has been operating in Jaffa Port since 2014 until 2020. Here you can see how the technology works. Basically, the floaters are going up and down and pushing the hydro cylinders, which transmit by the gradeable fluid into land-located accumulators. A pressure is being built, the higher the waves, the higher the pressure, which is used to turn the hydro motor, which is turning the generators. The whole system is controlled by a smart automation system, which you can see right here. And in case of upcoming storms, the system automatically raises the floater above the water level and keeps them in the upward position until the storm passes. The company has been operating a 100-kilowatt grade-connected device in Gibraltar since 2016, which is enough to power 100 households. Currently, Innu and her team are working on another 100-kilowatt project at the Ported Jaffa in Tel Aviv. The project will be also the first time in the history of Israel that wave energy will officially connect to the electrical grid. And our goal going forward is to expand it to all suitable breakwaters in the city of Tel Aviv and to supply significant part of the city's electricity needs. Today, engineers and entrepreneurs",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,593,2022-11-18 17:06:13
17980," We apply a significant part of the city's electricity needs. Today, engineers and entrepreneurs are still trying to crack wave energy. Globally, only a few hundred kilowatts of wave energy are deployed, compared with gigawatts of offshore wind. But the filters come a long way in recent years, and with the right engineering solutions, this new power source could eventually become competitive with more mature renewables like solar and wind. I would have a lot more confidence in the success of wave energy companies today, as opposed to like 20 years ago. But in the next few years or maybe the next couple of decades, it will be more likely to be used in remote locations, like islands that are otherwise dependent on expensive diesel power, or out at sea on gas-den-commissioning rigs or for powering and the water-autonomous vehicles. So definitely, wave energy can compete with other renewable energy sources, but I personally believe that this is not a competition. In order to have a 100% renewable energy-friendly world, we need all renewable energy sources to work together. So can you please tell me? I'm not going to tell you. Please wait. You know, I've covered a lot of companies, I've covered a lot of Machiavellian companies where, you know, people play rough. I don't think I've ever seen anything on the scale that Nissan has. Can you make a deal with your work? I mean, you're eating it for a while. One of the most dramatic elements was Riven Dupassi's home, being rated by court officials in Yokohana. You scared me. You scared Machiavellian. I love you. You said you were 16 years old. So Riven Dupassi's journey into the darkest recesses of the Japanese corporate world started when he was the general council, the highest corporate lawyer position in the company. In the past few minutes, Nissan has revealed that it's German, has been arrested after allegations of serious misconduct. He was tasked with investigating Carlos Gaulle. And he was told conduct an internal investigation and get to the heart of the matter. And then along the way, he started to notice serious conflicts of interest. He is one of the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,594,2022-11-18 17:10:38
17981," And then along the way he started to notice serious conflicts of interest. He is one of the few people who knows an extreme amount of detail regarding the alleged crimes by Pearl Skone. And he is now ready to tell his own story on the record about some of the events that happened. My name is Rivinda Passey. I am the former Global General Counsel of Nisamotako Limited. And you could say yes, I had a front row seat in terms of what was going on. When Carlos Gone saved Nisamot years ago, he was depicted in Japanese comic books as this hero. And now maybe we'll see comic books where he's the villain. In corporate Japan, Nisamotako was quite an unusual company. It was led for two decades by a non-Japanese executive. Well, Carlos Gone was a hero in the Japanese business world. If you had a global business celebrity in Japan and worldwide, it was definitely Carlos Gone. In a country with few foreigners at the top, he stood out. But over the years, he saved Nisamotako from bankruptcy, allied with Rino and Mitsubishi and turned the alliance into one of the most competitive in the world. Yet as the years went on, I think his ambitions changed a little bit. He started thinking about legacy plays. And one of them was to really tighten the alliance between Rino and Japan. And unbeknownst to him, there was a contingent of senior Nisamotako executives that were really felt threatened by that move. They really thought that they would lose complete control of the car company. And even in the government, there was probably a little bit of anxiety about a national champion in the auto industry following under full blown foreign control. Carlos Gone was an auto industry leader respected by many in Japan. Now he's in jail. The arrest of Carlos Gone came completely out of the blue. This was in November of 2018. He was coming to Japan on Nisamot's corporate jet for a regular executive meeting. And he was met on the tarmac by Japanese authorities who whisked him away to jail and charged him with financial misconduct crimes. So what happened was a power struggle ensued inside the company. And somewhere along the way, it was criminalized. By that I mean that there were allegations leveled at Carlos Gone about the way he reported his pay to Japanese authorities, the way he handled money inside the company, that in other contexts might have been a board action, might have been handled internally. A number of executives at Nisam decided to take this difference and take it over to the Tokyo Prosecutor's office. And that unleashed a chain of events that would shake the entire auto industry. So after Carlos Gone was arrested, Nisam launched an internal investigation into the events that led up to his arrest. So Rob Pasey was tasked with investigating Carlos Gone. And he was told get to the heart of the matter. Find out what Carlos Gone did wrong and bring it to our shareholders. Yeah, it's really complicated because you had various things coming out of the weeds. 2018 investigation has started and we become aware of matters in terms of conflicts, actions by certain individuals, that cause some concern because things might not quite be what they seem. So in our story, we really took a close look at Harinata and his role in Carlos Gone.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,595,2022-11-18 17:14:49
17982," Quite be what they seem. So in our story, we really took a close look at Harinada and his role in Carlos Gones downfall. Harinada is one of the most fascinating figures inside Nissan. He's also a lawyer. He's originally Malaysian. Hello Mr. Heidi. And he had a meteoric rise through the company and became very, very close to Carlos Gones and other top figures. He had a front row seat at all the major strategic deliberations at the company. And when he discovered that Carlos Gones as his final legacy play was going to tighten the relationship between Renaud and Nissan, he made a decision to go against Carlos Gones. And he became one of the key figures that decided that Carlos Gones had to go. Harinada was somebody who actually recruited me into the company. So I have a long-standing relationship with him or did have a long-standing relationship with him. For many, many years, he was a mentor. I had doubts about the credibility of the process right at the start. Harinada had a plea deal with the Tokyo prosecutors. Now that suggests he was intrinsically involved in some of the wrongdoing or the allegations of wrongdoing. It just didn't smell right, it just doesn't sit right. So there was a basic conflict of interest. In other words, Harinada had to deliver results to Japanese prosecutors to avoid his own criminal liability and he's accusing and leading the investigation of Carlos Gones. Some of the people who had been involved in the original alleged crimes were also looking into the affairs themselves. Revinder Pasi began pointing out some of these conflict of interest issues. And the reason for that is essentially his concern was for the company. If the company's own investigation into itself was compromised, that could lead to a very weak position in various lawsuits that it was dealing with across the world. I had discussions with Harry, discussions about with the statutory auditors about these conflicts, discussions with HR, about some of these conflicts, because at that point we reported into him. At the time everything was quite, as you can imagine, it was, we've got to do this, we've got to do that, we've got to move fast. But when you step back and look at some of these things, you just think, my God, what was going on here? Because me, members of my team were being placed in immediate danger. Your chairman's been arrested. A representative director's been arrested. They both happened to be foreigners. And then now what we need to do, we're being instructed to do, is certain compliance professionals need to go into properties in Brazil, for example, and retrieve evidence. They've got to do it very carefully, because if they don't do it carefully, they're going to get convicted of criminal activities. And likewise, when a team of lawyers were commissioned to go to Lebanon, I mean, one of my immediate concerns was, why are lawyers from Nissan being sent to go to Lebanon to retrieve evidence? These are just lawyers, they're called lawyers from Nissan. You had revelations that a number of executives had benefited from share appreciation rights, when they shouldn't have. I mean, you know, substantive amounts of money being taken by these guys when they weren't entitled to take them. And you do think, yes, how is this going to look later?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,596,2022-11-18 17:19:30
17983," The answer of money being taken by these guys when they weren't entitled to take them. Yes, how is this going to look later on? It's going to look quite concerning. So that triggered for me the sort of assessment that, well, I'm going to have to do something because up until this point, I haven't put down on paper these conflicts and these issues. So Rob Posse makes a fateful move. He writes this letter to the board, listing every suspicion he has and great detail backed up by evidence backed up by memos of why this internal investigation had serious problems. He sends a letter to the board and it's crickets. He doesn't hear much of anything. Nothing happened there often. Nothing at all. Just like it just gone into a black box. And he began to suspect that there was a desire even at the highest level within Nissan to kind of sweep these conflicts of interest under the rug. Unfortunately for me, I think, again with hindsight, people must have thought that this is the nail that's sticking out and we can't have this. Within three days of me submitting that to the board of directors, that letter to the independent board of directors, I was removed from the go-and-executive conduct matters. I was then told that I could not attend board meetings anymore. And up until that point, I had attended every single board meeting. I was then also told that after eight years of being in Japan, I'd be going back to the UK. Eventually transpired that I'd be the VP of projects and transformation, managing a team of three. So you can imagine what this feels like at this stage. Almost an arbitrary removal from Japan where I've lived for eight years, had three children there. My family has grown up and we've been settled there. A few months earlier, been promoted to vice president at a global level to be almost demoted. So Pasi was essentially being reassigned to get him as far away from the internal investigation as possible and also to a certain extent in retaliation to some of the issues that he brought up regarding the internal investigation and Harinata. What happened to Rav Pasi can be seen as a series of corporate humiliations. I mean, first of all, his immediate responsibilities were taken away from him. Eventually he'd lost the coveted general counsel title. But it didn't stop there. Toward the end of his stay in Japan, Rav and his wife were convinced that they were being followed. During that period, I'd noticed that whilst driving my car, I'd have other cars following me. First I noticed this was in a round mid-march and I was driving. I can't remember where I was going but this grey van, small van, just literally started following me. And I noticed that there was somebody in the car taking pictures. And lo and behold, we were absolutely being followed by either by people on foot or other individuals. Two or three normally two burly men in a car, different cars at different times following us.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,597,2022-11-18 17:23:28
17984," on foot or other individuals, two or three, normally two, burly men in a car, different cars at different times, following us around. They were following the family as well. And given we'd seen, right seen, the Nissan Security Department, behaving a very, very egregious manner with others in terms of following and surveilling, I was very concerned as to what they were doing and who they were giving this information to. Because if they're giving this information to the authorities, you do think, why? What's going on there? I mean, this is just not normal behavior. And this all culminated in a rather dramatic event in the middle of 2020. Who are you people where Nissan had hired a legal team and had obtained an unusual court order from the District Court in Yokohama? To basically do a search of his home and seizure of his corporate laptop and phone and another document. If you don't let us in now, we have to break this key. So it's a pretty extreme way to treat someone who had spent 16 years at the company. These people have all come in. We don't really know who they are, apart from the fact that I've been shown a badge that says the Yokohama Court. And they hit to recover a laptop and a mobile phone. It was even more weird, because I'd highlighted to the directors that certain Nissan executives were trying to recover this laptop and this phone whilst I was still in Japan. And I was very concerned, because it had evidence on there that related to misconduct matters and other forms of inappropriate conduct. It was just another form of intimidation, another form of harassment, forcing me almost to leave the company and the country. Because once they'd retained and obtained these items, we were still followed, which again, I just couldn't understand what is the point of doing that. This is not a car company. This is not the KGB. I think it's fair to say that Rob Posse didn't have full battlefield awareness of all the intrigue going on at Nissan. I mean, Harry Nata is interesting, because he's both charismatic and charming. And one of the most brutal corporate infighters one could ever run across. It's a confidential company email, right? You should not have this. If he had fallen into line, he would probably still have his job at Nissan be paid very well and continued his work. A career that he spent 16 years building at Nissan is irretrievably broken. It's been smashed to smithereens. He and his family paid a huge price certainly. But in terms of being able to sleep at night, I think he's come out ahead. I highlighted issues to the highest levels of the company so that they could be dealt with appropriately by those in charge. There was no response to those. And there was retaliation against me. What's really profound, like absolutely profound, is that none of your colleagues, I mean, people who you have known for years, forget it. You're on your own. And yeah, you've got to be ready for that. If you take it on anyway.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,598,2022-11-18 17:27:48
17985," The You This is the awful truth. There's always someone in the family that's pushing it. This lady does not deserve to be taken advantage of. Expressionally, at your age with your own grandchild. My grandma is having to sue them. I'm testifying against them. Nobody's talking. They're one floor below right now. I get afraid to go on the elevator. It's sad that it had a devolved to this. It's like a soap opera to a very sad thing. It's a family feud. A family feud. Here's a family that, on paper, you would think, has the wealth that so many people seek yet. At the end of the day, it's seem to rip everybody apart. My name's Tom Schoenberg. I'm a senior reporter here at Bloomberg News. Cover financial enforcement. I was approached by someone close to the Shottenstein family and asked whether or not I would be interested in writing about Beverly Shottenstein in this case that she had against JP Morgan. And it was immediately clear that there was a great story here to be told. So I started just assembling all sorts of documents that the family made available to me. They included a diary that Beverly had begun writing when she started having suspicions about what was actually going on with her money. Beverly obtained her wealth from the Shottenstein kind of retail empire that has, at times, included big lots, value city, American eagle outfitters, DSW shoes. Beverly's husband died, and at which point they sold off their portion of the company, bringing them an enormous amount of wealth in around 1990. Estimates of her wealth were around $90 million. She, for many years, had that pool of money being managed by outside advisors. Her grandsons, in the late 2000s, had both graduated and were becoming financial advisors. She gave them a little bit to work with, and over time, her grandson, Evan, became the trusty of her entire state. Managing sort of family money is not a conflict. In fact, some ways in wealth management, it's kind of how you get your start. It's kind of the seed that you need to sort of get going in the business. But, Beverly, start.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,599,2022-11-18 17:32:24
17986," is not a conflict. In fact, some ways in wealth management, it's kind of how you get your start. It's kind of the seed that you need to sort of get going in the business. But, Beverly started having suspicions that something was wrong probably in around 2016. Well, there were suspicious things, but taken separately without everyone talking about their own experiences, it was hard to really put it together. She had written a check to her caretaker Dawn that bounced. So, she went down to her local chase branch to sort of find out what was going on. She wasn't getting paper statements in the mail, so she asked them to print out a number of her statements having to do with her checking account and her credit card account. So, we went to the bank and asked for the statements. And she got a whole year and going through all of them page by page by page. And it was there. She saw all sorts of charges that she said she did not the rise or didn't know about. I was becoming very, very suspicious. I was starting to look in the money part and that's what bothered me more when I saw that money was going. And I was not a big spender. Around the same time Dawn, she starts noticing Beverly's son who lived in the condominium below her came up with Evan with a shredder and started grabbing papers in her office area, including some with JP Morgan Letterhead. And just started sitting at the kitchen table just shredding documents over and over. Yeah, they came in one morning. They used to do it in the back. Through the back door and they brought this shredder inside and then they went in the drawers in the office and took out all the papers and they started to do it. I was very suspicious because I know you don't go around and get in destroying papers. Beverly said that they had done this many times before. That's when she said to me, you know Dawn, I'm going to write my feelings in this black book. And she started writing. Each day she would write a little at a time. We run the holidays of 2018. The package had arrived. The FedEx package and in it were materials about a venture capital fund based out of the Cayman Islands. Dawn and some other family members take a look at this and they see that Beverly is signed up for this fund to the tune of a $5 million over the course of several years. And that was really the beginning of it. That was sort of the tip of the iceberg when it became obvious that something was going on that my grandmother really wasn't aware of this fund. You know, Beverly started to panic. She was got really upset and called, you know, JP Morgan's headquarters in New York and asked for Jamie Diamond. She said she was told someone would call her back, but she says that that never happened. She wrote a letter to Evan and Avi and in there she laid out a number of things that were concerning her on authorized trading, the checking account she had about a million dollars worth of jewelry in a safe deposit box and that her son Bobby had the key to that box and that jewelry had gone missing. All this was kind of packaged in this, you know, five-page handwritten, a memento will and trust. They're such an evolving narrative about why the jewelry was taken. The only truth we really know is that the jewelry is gone, but why it happened? There have been a lot of different stories. You just don't take your mother's wonderful things and hand it out. And they email that note to JP Morgan to seize all activity on her account. And it ended up setting off a firestorm after that. As soon as they got this email that there was a season to assist and that she wanted to send her money and change brokerage firms, they were actually vacationing one floor below downstairs through there right now. The next day, Beverly's in her place, the granddaughter still in her place visiting. Dawn is there and up comes Bobby kind of barging through the door and he's screaming about",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,600,2022-11-18 17:36:32
17987, and some acceptance and and and asking for forgiveness from my grandmother I don't think we'd be in the position that we are now. Since the piece came out we've you know we received dozens of messages from people many of whom are telling their own sort of personal tales of you know kind of financial advisors gone bad or family members who got control of in a state and abused you know those within seems sad it's really resonated with a lot of people like keep you know hearing a lot of feedback about Beverly and how you know a lot of people feel she did the right thing. You're never too old to stand up for yourself and try to write an injustice she was adamant that she wanted to stand up for herself at the end of the day they did wrong. It's a painful life lesson you know Beverly taught them that you don't mess with grandma. On April 20th oil markets did something they never had before and they crashed went into negative territory and closed the day at minus 40 dollars meanwhile in a place called Thaden Boyce in Essex a group of nine traders led by a guy called Cuddles made $660 million over the course of a couple of hours. The price of oil has collapsed to a record low. We've never really seen anything like it. WTI this morning down more than 35 percent. People maybe wouldn't have been so surprised if the oil price had fallen to zero but the oil price went to minus 38 it went far lower than anyone expected and so lots of people in the market were saying well hang on something else is going on here. A couple of months later I started to get wind through a kind of network of sources that a tiny firm in the outskirts of London had made a huge amount of money that day and potentially had some part to play and what happened. The information we got was that nine traders at Vega Capital London had made in the region of $660 million in one day. As a group I think they made as much money in one day as Apple makes from its international sales in one day I mean it's an insane sum of money. Did they pull off a fantastic trade? Did they predict the way the market was moving and get it absolutely right or was there something else going on and had they actually done something the breached market rules in a bid to sort of push the market and that investigation is ongoing. So Paul Cummins is a trader who caged teeth in the pits in the 80s and 90s when everyone had a nickname his was Cuddles. If you can imagine that was a very sort of cut throat type of world where people are doing you know hundreds of thousands and millions of dollars trades by shouting at each other giving hand signals and then sort of scrolling on scraps of paper. The culture of the trading pits in London was very influenced by the working class guys who became traders there. They weren't like the city bankers that had gone before them. They weren't usually Oxford or Cambridge you know they didn't wear saddle rose suits. They were ordinary working guys who happened to have a talent for trading and a lot of them came from Essex. I think it was 400 traders in the pits and Cuddles in his you know oil and gas pit.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,601,2022-11-18 17:43:41
17988," I think it was 400 traders in the pits and cuddles in his, you know, oil and gas pit was described to us as amongst the top three, you know, in amongst that was very successful and made, you know, very large amounts of money as a young man. But, you know, inevitably mechanization and the arrival of electronic markets was the kind of death knell for the pits and in 2005 the IPE closed down. And when the pits shut down, a lot of the traders who worked there, lost their jobs or quits or went to work for financial institutions, pull commons decided to start his own trading collective out in Essex. Some of them are ex-pick guys, cut from the same cloth as him. Lots of them are actually sort of in their twenties and they're, you know, drinking buddies, son or their own kids, friends from football. You know, their young lads, hungry and ambitious and he brings them into the fold. And fairly shortly he's got, you know, maybe a dozen or so traders that are independent, let's be clear, but they're all part of this collective. Yeah, I'll let Liam deal with Essex. I am from Essex, so I feel like I'm free to, you know, to get into it. Sweet as they say. If you were to ask someone in Britain how they would imagine a kind of Essex person, they would see someone who's maybe start a slightly flamboyant with a cockney accent, a guy which you start accent. You know, not afraid to splash the cash, but it's probably pretty bright and it's done well for themselves. Don't even make sense, does he? These guys, they drove around very nice rolls, roises and bent leaves. They went to places like Marbaea on holiday. Fade and voice is a very wealthy place. You have to have considerable income to be able to afford to live in that village. It's a really nice place to live and it's 20 minutes to chew right away from the city. Earlier in the summer, we have this lead, which is that there's this tiny firm called Vega Capital London, and they were the biggest winners from the biggest oil crash in history. You know, anyone that covers markets, he's going to be surprised about that. You know, you're thinking your BP's of the world or your Glen Cause, but it's this tiny firm. And one of the big challenges that we had was actually finding out who worked with Vega Capital. It wasn't immediately obvious, and at first we had absolutely no idea. If you go to the Vega Capital website, it says it's under construction. If you do basic online searching, it's very difficult to find anyone who's publicly connected to the company. So inevitably, we're incredibly curious at this point. Who the hell are these people? The more reporting we did, the more it became clear that this group were connected socially as well as professionally. They went to weddings together. They played golf together. They would go and holiday together. We found out that a number of them were members of the West Ham supporters club in London. A few of them started companies together, so you could see all the connections between them and start to see a distinct group emerging. And it really just was this kind of shock that, you know, this wasn't just like a hedge fund or a firm you'd never heard of. This was actually a group of buddies who all had the same experience on this day and had all made a huge amount of money. So if you're an oil trader, there's a number of different ways you can trade, and probably the most popular is WTI, future contracts. And it's basically a contract that says, I'm going to buy a thousand barrels of oil from you at this point in the future, or I'm going to sell a thousand barrels of oil to you at this point in the future. It's actually just a financial contract to gamble on to predict where oil was going to go up or down. On the 20th of April in Essex, there had been signals for a while that this was going to be an exceptional day in oil markets. And we know that some of them arose early and started their trading in the early hours of the morning while it was still dark outside. Essentially what they were doing is buying contracts that gave them an obligation to buy oil at whatever the price ended up at 230pm. So they're basically placing a bet that oil was going to fall throughout the day. But they're simultaneously selling lots of oil as well. And whether they make a profit and how much profit they make is the difference between what they buy the oil for and what they sell the oil for. And of course, we now know.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,602,2022-11-18 17:48:08
17989," between what they buy the oil for and what they sell the oil for. Of course, we now know throughout April 20th the price dropped and dropped. So this is going very well for them. You know, they are committed to selling oil at these prices and the prices are continuing to fall, which means they're going to be able to offset it and buy oil at cheaper at the end of the day. Now, once it gets to kind of 1.30 p.m. that's when things start to get really interesting. Suddenly, there's a kind of influx of buyers and sellers. You know, desperation increases in the market and trading volumes go up. Now, at 2.08 p.m. exactly something bizarre and unprecedented happened, which is the oil passes into negative territory. And it fell to a record level of minus $38. We've never seen anything like a period in terms of the contraction of the global economy. That huge gulf between what they were buying the oil for and what they were selling it for enabled them to make more money than they ever thought possible. So their profit was the difference between minus 37 and all of these positive numbers on every contract they sold. The price of crude briefly hit minus $37 a barrel. For one group of traders operating from a small office, it was a very, very profitable day. It's important to remember this had never happened before in the history of oil trading. No one could have predicted it. I can't think of another example of where you enter a trader, you get paid on both sides, you get paid both to sell and to buy. You know, it's unthinkable. One thing we know about the Cuddles Trading Arcade is that they were very comfortable taking large risks. And you know, you have to be clear, this was a large risk. Yeah, we spoke to oil traders, both people that know these guys and people that don't. And they also say that this is incredibly risky. And that's actually what stops a lot of oil traders doing trading like this. They simply aren't willing to stomach the risk. But Cuddles and his friends were. So when the kind of final calculations came down, the group of the nine most profitable traders made $660 million or thereabouts between them. I mean, if you can imagine, I think three or four of them made in excess of 100 million each. One of the astonishing things about this trade is that two of the individuals who made more than $100 million in a single day were in their 20s. One of them was 22 years old. You know, only a few years earlier, he'd been posting on his social media about doing teenage stuff with his mates in town and going to see girls and rap music. And here he is a few years later, making $100 million in a single day's trading. When we in Liam discovered that, we were just, we couldn't believe it. We couldn't believe what we were seeing. Oil trading is a zero sum game. Anytime you're making money as an oil trader, someone else is losing it. Amongst the biggest losers were the investors in this Chinese fund, crude oil treasure fund. There were thousands of them and they lost everything. Lots of people have put their savings into oil funds. They lost money that day. Big banks and brokers who sort of stand in the middle of trading parties, they lost money that day. And another interesting thing is that oil producing countries like Q8 or Canada, they sell oil as an average of the WTI closing price over the preceding month. So the fact that one of those numbers in that average was minus 37, meant if you can imagine countries like Saudi Arabia and Q8, potentially lost a couple of dollars on every single barrel of oil they sold that month. Vega Capital's traders made such an extraordinary sum of money that it was inevitable they would be some scrutiny of what they did. But it wasn't just the sums of money they made. In the vital half an hour before the settlement price was set, they were by far the biggest sellers of oil futures in the market, which is an incredible thing to think about. When you consider that the other participants in that oil market are going to be the world's biggest banks, you know, oil majors, BP and Shell, and here you have a group of nine guys in Essex who are having this significant influence over a global market for oil. I mean, I think you have to assume that if these guys have made seven million or ten million dollars, they probably would be celebrating in Essex right now. But the fact that they made closer to 700 million has meant that they are facing understandable scrutiny. We wrote individually to...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,603,2022-11-18 17:52:31
17990," Six right now, but the fact that they made closer to 700 million has meant that they are facing understandable scrutiny. We wrote individually to all the all the Begger traders who did exceptionally well that day. And we got a letter in response from a law firm representing the group. The law firm was a painstor point out, number one, that they haven't been accused of any wrongdoing. That they all traded independently and separately and they basically all made up their own minds that this was what was going to happen in oil markets based on publicly available knowledge and decided to execute this trade. What I love about these stories is there's a real variance of opinion and some people will look at what happened and think that must be dodgy. They all traded at the end of the day, they all made a huge amount of money while all these people lost. That's shocking, but lots of people say these guys are acute disadvantage. They're in a market that's inhabited by huge technology driven, funds and firms and oil giants that have got all the advantages in the world. And when you get a bunch of Essex geysers who essentially beat the market and find a way to make a huge amount of money, that should get a pat on the back really because that's the dream. Since this happened, a lot of the guys have stopped trading the monthly settlements that they've done so well out in the past. Several of them have set up new companies. They've essentially gone very quiet. Any kind of social media presence they had is kind of closed down. By all accounts there, you know, waiting this out. It's certainly too early to try and predict how the regulatory investigations are going to pan out. We just don't know. There's a number of potential outcomes for these guys. Potential punishments if there are any findings of manipulation against Vega or anyone affiliated with it might be you could be fine. You could be banned from trading. And you know, in most extreme cases there have even been criminal prosecutions in the past of people who have been found to have been manipulating the settlement and misconduct related to trade settlement. There are other outcomes too. One obvious one is going to be they're able to walk away from this life changing trade with all the money that they made and celebrated as heroes in the trading community. They'll go down as legends. It's very important given the nature of the climate crisis right now for the general public to have an understanding of what progress is or is not actually happening. And I think many readers right now they'll see these hundreds and hundreds of companies making these big bold climate claims. And they would be forgiven to think that, you know, we're well on our way to meeting the emission reduction trajectory we need to be on. And the reality of the matter is we're just not on that trajectory and a key reason for this sort of disconnect is the use of offsets that aren't doing what they claim to be doing. We have a massive potential for sort of willful blindness. We can convince ourselves of things regardless of what the facts are. And so that's what tends to happen in these cases. It's not that it's not that anybody is setting out to commit climate fraud. They sort of walk themselves into a situation and they convince themselves of one thing and that allows them to convince themselves of another thing. But at the end of the day they're doing something that makes no sense at all.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,604,2022-11-18 17:56:48
17991," But at the end of the day, they're doing something that makes no sense at all. My name is Ben Elgin. I wrote the story about how the billion dollar market for carbon offsets is setting back the fight against climate change. So one of the challenges in reporting on carbon offsets and trying to figure out what's going on is really finding good experts who have been steeped in this marketplace and are willing to candidly talk about it. One of the best people for this is a fellow named Mark Trexler and I've been talking to him for more than a decade. My name is Mark Trexler. I've worked in climate change for the last 30 years. I was actually hired by the World Resources Institute in Washington to work on the first carbon offset project in 1988. In terms of defining a carbon offset that one of the beauties, so to speak, of greenhouse gases, sort of the silver lining of greenhouse gases, you can, when you put up a molecule of CO2 into the atmosphere, it can be anywhere in the planet in seven days. And therefore, you know, if there's an option to reduce emissions on the other side of the planet, and you can do that very cheaply as compared to doing it in your factory, for example, then why not pay that person that factory on the other side of the planet to reduce their emissions, then you are in a sense offsetting your emissions and the atmosphere doesn't really see your emissions anymore. So, carbon offsets have been been around for quite some time, and they were actually key with these international climate agreements, such as the Kyoto Protocol, which mandated the wealthiest countries reduced their greenhouse gas emissions. The trade was signed on the 11th of December 1997. Decided. The business community, in general, saw carbon offsets as a huge opportunity to comply with whatever policies and measures might be coming down the pike on climate change, much more cost effectively. We've seen a huge surge in companies making big proclamations about how they're going carbon neutral or zeroing out all of their carbon emissions. We're going to reduce our carbon footprint to net zero. Unilever is committing to net zero emissions. We can achieve a net zero emissions world. We began looking at these corporate claims of dramatically reduced emissions, and we noticed so many of these companies were using carbon offsets to achieve these aims, and as we began to look at the carbon offset projects themselves. What we found is that the environmental benefits claimed by these companies are not actually what they seem to be. And as we sort of saw and spotted a number of these very aggressive carbon offset projects, which appeared to be generating inflated credits or bogus credits, we saw a number of them were associated with the Nature Conservancy. This surprised us. The Nature Conservancy is the world's biggest environmental group. They have about a billion dollars a year in revenues, and they've been around for seven decades. They've preserved about 125 million acres of land. They've done so many good works over the years, and they've been very strong in terms of working with corporate partners. The Nature Conservancy has taken a different approach, a very pragmatic and pro-business approach. They will not go out and criticize a big polluter, but they're very happy to work with them. Some might say that, well, that's selling out, but others would say, and those at the Nature Conservancy would say, these companies have deep pockets. They can help fund important preservation work, and we have absolutely no problem working with them on this stuff. So, companies are very warm, and they've partnered with the Nature Conservancy for many years, and yeah, it definitely lends a sheen of credibility to these projects. Here's 20 Nuries in the Disney World this year! 1, 2, 3, 4...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,605,2022-11-18 18:01:23
17992," projects. Here are 20 NERI's and this is the Disney World this year! One, two, three, four, three. If you look at, for instance, Disney. It's a sprawling company with theme parks and cruise lines that burn up diesel fuel. They have office buildings and television studios that consume electricity. So these companies are trying to make major, major reductions in their carbon footprints, but it's very difficult to change these fundamental ways their businesses operate. So Disney has been a big buyer of carbon offsets that are orchestrated by the Nature Conservancy. One of the projects that they buy from is called Pennsylvania Riges. And that's a plot of land. Most of the land is actually about a three-hour drive outside of Philadelphia. Interestingly, this land, 3,000 of these acres, was actually acquired by the Nature Conservancy in the late 1990s. This land was imminently threatened. There was a pending logging contract on this land. So they do what they have done so well for all of these years, which is they go out. They raise money from local philanthropists and they go buy this land to protect it from developers and loggers. And at the time, according to an archive version of the Nature Conservancy's website, when they were proudly announcing this deal, they said these threats have been abated because of this acquisition by the Nature Conservancy. So it's really interesting now fast forward two decades to earlier this year when they put forward this carbon project. And if you look through it, this land is a key part of that carbon project. And what they're now saying is this land is now once again imminently threatened. 72% of the trees are going to be cut within five years. Now this is just astounding because this land is owned by the Nature Conservancy. They do not clear-cut land that they've bought through philanthropic donations. So this scenario that they've put forward to get carbon revenues is not really plausible. And what that means is when you have Disney coming in and buying these credits, when it eventually lowers its carbon footprint because of these credits, well that won't be a credible or truthful claim by Disney. So this is an organization that truly understands the threat of the issue of climate change and is wanting to do its part to address this. However, in this situation, it just appears their drive, which they've had for decades, to increase the amount of revenues that it can use for land preservation work. Nature Conservancy and many others see that carbon credits as a pot of money that they can tap into to further their own benevolent aims. But unfortunately, what this has resulted in is claims of climate progress that just aren't really happening. So the Nature Conservancy defends vigorously these deals and they and others will say, look, our projects are just following the rules that these registries set up. So some would also put some of the blame on the registries themselves because they're setting up the rules which allow these vapid projects to get up and sold. So we've reached out to all of the companies we mentioned in this story including Disney. They didn't want to be interviewed for this story but they all told us that, look, we have to rely on the experts out there and those experts they say are these carbon registries that have been set up. Most of these nature Conservancy deals are set up and sold on this exchange. It's called the American Carbon Registry. Now it's the oldest of these registries that allow voluntary carbon credits to be sold. They've been around since 1996. What these offset registries do is they set up rules and any carbon offset project has to follow those rules. But there's this tension that's always there. If the rules are too strict, then it's going to be very hard for carbon offset projects to get up and running. So there's this balance going on where the registries...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,606,2022-11-18 18:05:27
17993," If the rules are too strict, then it's going to be very hard for carbon offset projects to get up and running. So there's this balance going on where the registries want rules that attract projects, but they don't want it to be so strict where it will disincentivize projects from getting listed. One of the challenges with designing carbon offset systems is that there are normally two people at the table. You have buyers and you have sellers. And to some extent you have policy makers, but the buyers and the sellers are really the ones with the expertise, with the incentive to really participate hard, make a lot of things happen. And the challenge there is is that both of them sort of want the same thing, or they're both happy with the same thing. They're happy with low-cost offsets and a lot of them, because that works for their business model. You end up, though, with nobody really representing the atmosphere, so to speak, nobody's really representing the climate in those discussions. And so the policies end up biasing the whole system. And you end up in sort of a race to the bottom. And that's what we've seen happen. You know, when it comes specifically to the topic of carbon offsets, I am a fan of carbon offsets in the sense that they can help mitigate climate change. They absolutely can. But if we're not going to do it correctly, in a way that actually does help mitigate climate change, then it's nothing but a distraction. And after 30 years, you have to start wondering, is it really just a distraction? And that's really unfortunate, but that's where we are. Ultimately, what needs to be what needs to happen is systemic change. You know, we're sort of nibbling around the edges with some of these different things. We need to change how we produce energy. We need to change how we transport ourselves. We need to change what and how we eat. You know, we need systemic change associated with transitioning to a low carbon economy. A lot of what we're doing today is not promoting systemic change. It's sort of trying to stick your thumb in the dike to preserve the current system. And at the end of the day, that can't really work. The Hyperloop. There's a good chance you've heard the name by now. This is the Hyperloop system. It can take people hundreds of miles in minutes. The Hyperloop has a series of tubes that would transport people in pods at ultra high speeds over long distances. It's a remarkable new form of transportation that can whisk people from city to city in a flash. 29 minutes from New York to DC, 30 minutes from LA to San Francisco. For years, we've been seeing these futuristic utopian renderings of some cross between a spaceship and a monobrille. But lately, the Hyperloop is becoming much more real.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,607,2022-11-18 18:09:49
17994," of some cross between a spaceship and a monorail. But lately, the Hyperloop is becoming much more real. Yeah, it was surreal to be even sitting inside a Hyperloop and just even more incredible to actually be like riding down a track in something that was nothing more than a crazy idea six years before. Companies all around the world have been developing and testing the technology needed to propel passengers at speeds of over 1000 kilometers per hour. But for many, speed is only the first step to unlocking the full transformational effects of a new mode of transportation. Fast is what we just sort of take for granted in the Hyperloop world. It's the network effects that really deliver the benefit and that opens up a completely different scale of economic opportunity. We've got planes, trains, automobiles and boats. We're getting around Earth. But what if there was a fifth mode and I have a name for it, name for it which is called the Hyperloop. The Hyperloop? Hyperloop, yeah. In 2013 while riding high on the growing success of Tesla and SpaceX, entrepreneur Elon Musk released a white paper outlining the basic framework of the technology he called Hyperloop. The basic idea goes a little something like this. A tube reduces the air pressure to a near vacuum like environment. A Hyperloop pod is then suspended in the tube, usually by magnetic levitation. The whole pod can then be propelled forward. Because there's no traditional friction sources like air resistance or rolling friction that would push back against the pod, the Hyperloop is able to move at incredibly high speeds and do so fairly efficiently. Despite its futuristic name however, the general concept behind Hyperloop is actually pretty old. In fact, New York City's first attempt at an underground public transit system in the 1870s was based on a similar principle. The pneumatic transit system was short lived however, only stretching one block and topping out at a rather leisurely 10 miles per hour. While Elon would make some 21st century improvements to this concept and bestow a very 21st century name, he wouldn't end up pursuing the technology itself. Instead, electing to focus his efforts on something a little bit deeper, literally digging the requisite tunnels by a his boring company. It would take another billionaire industrialist who dabbles in spaceflight, and no, wait, not that one. Yeah, that's the one. After Richard Branson would make a large investment in the company Hyperloop 1, it would be renamed to Virgin Hyperloop. What we've always been trying to do as a company is show that this technology could work, that it could be made safe, and that ultimately it's something that's happening in the next couple of years, not the next 20 years. Josh Geigel is the co-founder and CEO of Virgin Hyperloop. In a familiar tech startup story, he's seen the project go from a garage to a large scale testing facility outside of Las Vegas. So we started building the first kind of Hyperloop system in 2016. We've done a lot of work, about a 500 tests that we've done on that over the last five years. And what we realized that we need to do is take that technology, show that it can be commercial. So drive the cost down, improve the efficiency, improve the performance. But the key thing is, you know, is actually making it approachable and safe for individuals. In order to do that, Josh, along with Virgin's head of passenger experience, Sara Luchian, bravely volunteer to take the inaugural bride. What her and I were realizing is like, we're the first two people sitting in a Hyperloop. The only type of people that have gone through this environment are in spaces, and there we are, in just like normal clothes because of the safety of what we designed. Three, two, one, launch. And then once we started going, you felt a bit of acceleration. We accelerated a little bit harder than we would in commercial. Be like a sports car. We got it to about 108 miles an hour on that test. And it's a short run. It's about 500 yards or just so, and came to a stop. The test lasting only about 20 seconds and covering only a-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,608,2022-11-18 18:14:09
17995," It's a short run, it's about 500 yards or so, and came to a stop. The test lasting only about 20 seconds and covering only a quarter of a mile at just over 100 miles per hour. Is a long way away from a true functioning hyperloop? But as for optics, it's a crucial step for the future of funding. The number one question we got from investors or from project proponents or just people in general was like, is a hyperloop safe? And what better way to show something is safe than by actually getting people on it? But convincing investors and governments that would likely be fronting some of the construction costs for an unproven technology is no easy task. First and foremost is the question of safety. Most people don't know how an airplane works, but yet they get on an airplane. They get on an airplane because it's faster than driving, and most importantly, they've probably gotten off of one before, they've seen someone get off of one before. And so what we set out to do was actually show that hyperloop could be safe. With two normal people, not astronauts, not adrenaline junkies or test pilots or anything like that, two normal people getting on a hyperloop, and then most importantly, those two people getting off. But beyond safety concerns, constructing hyperlubes will undoubtedly require a significant capital investment, to the estimated tune of around 60 million US dollars per kilometer of track. So a track from San Francisco to Los Angeles, for example, is likely to come with a price tag over 10 billion dollars. And before large governments are willing to come in and front those costs, investors who are funding hyperloop development must accept it as a long term mixture of technology and infrastructure investing. Investors that are used to short returns because you're developing apps or something to that effect, you know, those aren't the investors that really get excited about hyperloop. What you start to see is the people that are looking at platform technologies, right? So this idea that because this smartphone existed, Uber could exist, right? So who are like the Vanderbilts of this century? And that's the part where you're going to get a lot more knows than yeses. But those people that have the ability, that the fortitude to stick it out to see the game changing platform here, those are the people that we're looking for. And since we've done that passenger test, there has been a lot of interest that's really, oh, this is a lot sooner than I thought. In visioning the ripple effects of what hyperloop could achieve, though, is fairly challenging at this stage of development. It's fast, yes, but for point to point, travel traditional maglev trains can move pretty fast as well. And outside of China, South Korea, and Japan, even those haven't seen much adoption elsewhere due to the high costs and questionable profitability. The Shanghai line in China, for example, loses around $100 million every year. Hyperloop companies, however, believe they can offer something different than traditional railway lines. My name's Alan James. And as far as I know, I'm the only guy on the planet who's written the government level business case for 300 kmh conventional high speed rail, 500 kmh maglev and 1,000 kmh hyperloop. It's fundamentally about moving people from where they are, to where they want to go, when they want to make those journeys, and doing it in much smaller numbers. So pod designs for hyperloop range from 12 to 28 seats, typically. Why are they small? It's because small enables the network to operate flexibly. And a great example of that is the East West strategic route across the north of England, from Liverpool to Manchester to Leeds. So to get from Liverpool via Manchester to Leeds by train is just short of two hours today.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,609,2022-11-18 18:18:26
17996," from Liverpool to Manchester to Leeds. So to get from Liverpool via Manchester to Leeds by train is just short of two hours today. It'll probably take you two hours driving as well in average traffic conditions. That result is those three city regions remain three separate entities. Liverpool Manchester leads. There's very little commuting traffic between those urban areas. Hyperloop absolutely changes that from the ground up. Liverpool to Manchester is a five or six minute journey. Manchester to Leeds is also a five or six minute journey. What effectively does is create a single super city economy. In this vision, the Hyperloop acts a little more like a highway, where pods have fixed destinations and don't need to stop along the way. Meaning you can travel on a Hyperloop network from say Liverpool to Leeds, while the pod behind you travels from Liverpool to Manchester. And if that Metro Hyperloop network is connected to other networks from the same location, you could travel from Liverpool to Paris or Liverpool to Amsterdam, all without making a single stop. For passengers, for business, for leisure, that is utterly transformational. For high-value freight and logistics, it's equally transformation. But critically, if you do a Hyperloop network at scale, you begin to deliver massively significant carbon savings to it. A multi-regional Hyperloop network could become a replacement for both short haul passenger and cargo flights and traditional ground transportation, both of which are significant carbon producers. One Hyperloop-connected distribution hub, perhaps at an airport that is predominantly used for international air freight, replacing maybe 10, 12, 15 distributed road hubs. It takes a lot of polluting and inefficient truck haulage off the roads. That itself means roads gain extra capacity. Hyperlubes will still need to use electricity to both move pods and maintain the near-vacuum environment and the tube. The proponents of the technology believe that this can be done by using renewable sources, including a combination of solar panels and battery technology that could be used along the Hyperloop itself. But even with all multipliers of time and carbon emission savings that a Hyperloop network may provide, the investment capital required to actually build such a network becomes even more economically and politically daunting. Committing doesn't mean spending billions on day one. Committing means how do we phase it? One company in the Netherlands is working to develop that technology, and perhaps more importantly, the international coalition needed to make the Hyperloop network a reality. So we are here in Europe's first full-scale Hyperloop test facility, where we can already prove every conceptual technology of the Hyperloop. This is Tim Houter, a co-founder and CEO of Heart Hyperloop, headquartered in the city of Delft. And while this testing tube might not seem as large as others, inside is a key technology to create the on and off-ramp type infrastructure of a Hyperloop network that is a lane switch. That's something we can already test here. You can actually see it here. That the track is diverging from one track into two, that makes it possible to eventually split up the Hyperloop track in two sections, and in that sense you can create a complete Hyperloop network. But in the end, we'll make it possible to travel, for example, over over a whole continent. I think Europe, for example, with the same ease as you can now travel with a metro in the city. The nice thing about this magnetic navigation system that we have developed is that there's absolutely zero moving components in the track. So for example, if you have to do a lane switch, all you do is that the tube basically splits up, and statically the tracks also split up, and whenever the vehicle enters...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,610,2022-11-18 18:22:48
17997," All you do is that the tube basically splits up, and statically the tracks also split up. And whenever the vehicle enters a switch, it either pulls itself to the right with its magnets, or pulls itself to the left with its magnets. Lane switching on traditional rail requires the physical movement of the rail. Even modern magnetic levitation tracks use lane switching techniques in order to transfer trains from one track to another. And this is a very crucial element because this is the thing that limits the capacity and in the end the usefulness of the real network. Because the moment that a track is switching, that means that at that moment you are creating an unsafe environment for the trains behind it. So you need a lot of space between trains. Then a high point because you have no moving components in the track, all the vehicles can be much closer to each other. You can achieve a very high frequency and basically have vehicles moving and merging in and out of the network very much like a highway. For now though, Hart's physical testing has been limited by the size of their tube. Because the test track is only 30 meters long, they haven't tested this lane switch at speeds greater than 20 kilometers per hour. However, the company is working to build a new test site where it plans to increase that testing speed to 300 kilometers per hour. We're now in a phase where we have proven most of the most important technologies in the test facilities that we already have. And we have also demonstrated the viability and the feasibility of a network. If you look at all the top systems that it consists of, most of those are proven systems. We already demonstrated in lab conditions, so we don't really believe that the technology itself is going to be the biggest challenge. Because for all Hyperloop companies out there, actually building a Hyperloop system requires more than just a good product. We're talking about the safety aspects, we're talking about integration into the environment, we're talking about social aspects, do people feel comfortable traveling in such a system. So it's about all these different aspects and the complexity is really getting all the different stakeholders that are relevant and that they need to contribute to bring this to market to get them all following the same roadmap. In order to help build this coalition of private and public interest in Hyperloop development, heart in 2018 partnered with other Hyperloop companies from Europe and Canada. The goal was to define, establish and standardize the framework to regulate Hyperloop systems. Right now we are working with all the Hyperloop developers together in setting up the first, let's say, a structure for starting the standards drafting. One of the most important goals for heart is interoperability, which is essentially making sure the different systems can communicate with each other. Interoperability is so important because what we want to achieve is actually have this seamless travel experience. So you don't want to end up, for example, going from Madrid to Paris and then switching because you need to use a different technology to get, for example, to Amsterdam. The idea being that as companies around Europe create the first commercial Hyperloop tracks between individual cities, one day those can all be connected to a larger network. Everyone that believes that Hyperloop is a future transport system also realizes that there is a need to have this network because that's where Hyperloop thrives. Hyperloop is such a huge project, it's definitely not something that you can do in your own or as a single company. So you need to do it with a lot of other companies, you need to have the governments. I think in that sense, the biggest challenge that we've encountered is to really get all the required parties together to take.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,611,2022-11-18 18:27:07
17998," With a lot of other companies, you need to have the governments. I think in that sense, the biggest challenge that we've encountered is to really get all the required parties together to take the steps in development and in commercial implementation. Hart's next plan is to build the European Hyperloop Center, an open testing facility which will include a 2.6-kilometer test track. And the company hopes to test travel speeds there at up to 700 kilometers per hour. Virgin Hyperloop is also racing to construct the first commercial Hyperloop route, with projects in various states of development in India, Saudi Arabia, and the United States. Recently, the company announced plans to build a Hyperloop certification center in West Virginia, which will include a six-mile-long test track. Proving the technology here will be crucial if Hyperloop networks can find a home among infrastructure investments that the Biden administration hopes to make. The idea that there's multiple Hyperloop companies, I think, is a redeeming aspect in the business. People really want to see something happen, so having multiple people move forward is good for that. I was struck when Josh and Sarah rode the pod. Two or three of the major outlets used the phrase, we now have a new mode of transport. And although all of that technology had existed before those two human beings rode it, it was the moment at which those two human beings traveled that short distance down the tube that in popular imagination Hyperloop became a mode of transport. The metaphor I use with my team is that, you know, the Wright Brothers refers, but none of us fly on Wright Brothers Airlines anymore. If you don't continue to innovate, you're not going to be around, and so we'll continue to be at the forefront of building Hyperloop. Back in 2013, Elon had an idea. I think the difference now in 2021 is some brilliant engineers have spent real time grinding out the details, and I thoroughly expect the next three to five years to be decisive.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,612,2022-11-18 18:31:40
17999," This week, how hydrogen can transform our energy usage. We'll look at why the universe's most abundant element could be a game changer in the climate revolution. Hydrogen technologies are not new. They are used in other sectors. We use them in space on our rockets and we don't need the laws of physics to change to be able to use hydrogen on our planes. From iron ore to green hydrogen, one of Australia's richest men tells us about his pivot to sustainable energy. Let's take action. It's practical. It's implementable. Let's do it now. Plus, the hydrogen revolution. We'll speak with the CEO of Italian Utilities firm, Stam, about his new book and how green hydrogen could be competitive within five years. Cossars are coming down and people are waking up to the fact that it's the only way to decarbonize certain sectors. From Bloomberg's Global headquarters in New York, I'm Kayleigh Lyons and this is Bloomberg Green. It's a new year, so here at Bloomberg Green we're highlighting new solutions in the fight against climate change. And one of those is as old as the universe itself. Hydrogen. It's the simplest element around but could well be a game changer when it comes to turning around our dependence on fossil fuels. Today, hydrogen is used in the chemicals industry to produce petroleum products. It's also starting to be used in steel production and industry under a lot of pressure to decarbonize. But it has far more uses as well, from powering cars to heating our homes. And Bloomberg New Energy Finance sees a seismic shift in the sector in the next ten years as green hydrogen squeezes out dirtier alternatives. So-called gray hydrogen dominates today. But as renewable electricity gets cheaper and more accessible, so will green hydrogen. In this week's edition of Bloomberg Green, we'll explore what this push into hydrogen means for tackling climate change. We'll hear from Australian billionaire Twiggy Forest about his pivot from Iron War II hydrogen. And we'll also speak with the CEO of Italian utility company Svamm about his book, The Hydrogen Revolution. But first, what are we using hydrogen for? And why does it actually matter? Christine Lee Edwards explains. Hydrogen, the most plentiful element in the universe. On Earth, we find it mostly bonded to oxygen in the form of water. Or in other gases known as hydrocarbons. Hydrogen gas, H2, burns hot and clean, making it an attractive tool in the race to net zero. But isolating hydrogen from other elements is no easy task. Today, the cheapest way to do this is via chemical processes that break up natural gas. This releases a lot of carbon dioxide. Another method is to use electricity to split water molecules in a process called electrolysis. Although there is no carbon byproduct, a lot of electricity is needed. And if this power comes from burning coal or gas, it negates to zero emissions goals of using hydrogen to begin with. Hydrogen produced in this way, powered by fossil fuels, is called grey hydrogen. If carbon capture and storage is used together with fossil fuels, then it becomes blue hydrogen. If nuclear power is used, it's called pink. And finally, green hydrogen is what is produced via electrolysis and powered from renewable sources. This method is considered emissions free. It's predicted that by the early 2030s, H2 made from renewables will be cheaper than that made from fossil fuels. But that hinges on the cost of electrolysis declining, which will be achieved through larger projects and an expansion of manufacturing. To be clear, vast amounts of H2 are already used today. Global production in 2018 totalled 117 million metric tons. This hydrogen is mostly used for its chemical properties, not as a source of energy, and very little of it is clean. Some sectors like steel could start using hydrogen for these chemical properties, replacing coal. Industries like cement and glass may also use hydrogen as a source of heat.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,613,2022-11-18 18:35:48
18000," Steel could start using hydrogen for these chemical properties, replacing coal. Industries like cement and glass may also use hydrogen as a source of heat. Another advantage is its energy storage potential. It can be stored over long periods of time and used when more power needs to be added to the grid. It also could hold an advantage over batteries and heavy transport and shipping. The promise of hydrogen for energy has been around since at least 1874, when Jules Verne wrote about it in his book, The Mysterious Island. But the future of hydrogen will depend on policy. Countries with net zero targets, carbon pricing and hydrogen strategies with investment mechanisms are likely to see the highest H.T. domain. That was Limburg's Christine Lee Edwards explaining what hydrogen means for the energy transition. But how are businesses approaching the sector? Well, one of Australia's richest men is making a big play into hydrogen. Andrew Forrest, better known as Twiggy, made his fortune from iron ore, being the chairman, former CEO and major shareholder in Fordescue Metals, one of the world's biggest miners. But after having made over $10 billion in profit from the metal in the last fiscal year, Twiggy wants to transform Fordescue into a clean energy company. He's been scouring the planet in search of investment opportunities in hydrogen and renewables. The firm plans to allocate up to 10% of its annual profits for green energy investments and is exploring projects across the globe from Indonesia to Argentina. Prancing Laqua caught up with 24-est. There's only one type of planet hydrogen. All the rest is dirty. Yeah. That is green. If you just say green hydrogen is clean, the rest is dirty, then you've actually nailed it. And, you know, anyone else who produces any other hydrogen, just looking at it and saying, why is global warming accelerating if anything you're saying is true? And then you know, actually, it's greenwashing. Yeah, but there's a lot of greenwashing because I keep on being told it's a transition. We can't just, you know, make the transition at a click of a finger. So what are we doing wrong? What can we do better? I don't remember the personal computer having to transition the typewriter. I really don't remember that. I don't remember the smartphone having to transition the pocket calculator and the old landline. You know, it's transition line is complete rubbish. The light got hooked to it. Two days ago when JCB, a really loved British company, you're in every right for the country to be proud of JCB. And Fortescue, holding a bit of a similar reputation, fantastic track record, everything super well from Fortescue, huge ballot sheets, super strong. When those two companies got together and agreed at 79 billion USD on a green with per atom, right, then that's a real wake up call to say hang on. Greenhagen is obviously commercial now. You know, every other form of fossil fuel, fossil fuel hydrogen, you know, it can compete with it on price. It can probably lose on price, but what we know, it is cooking the planet. And only greenhagen zero methane, zero carbon in the supply chain. Don't worry about the molecules in the supply chain. But at the moment, we're not even phasing out coal if you look at the G20 company cave. So we have a long way to go to talk about only using green hydrogen. Yeah, so look, I have a call, which I'd like to make now, that the world should not fund any more coal-fired power stations, coal-fired mining projects. Ever we should wind them down as quickly as possible because they are cooking the planet just like gray and greenhagen, it's completely the planet. No. You know, hydrogen should not make renewable electricity, it's releasing 10 to 16 times more carbon, let one of methane, which is worse than it is hydrogen. So we've just got to stop doing things which are self-harming under the guise of greenhagen. So why are leaders so slow, even if you look at the appetite for ESG investments, they're growing exponentially, so are emissions, so where are we allocating capital? Okay, so take the recent G20. There's probably a reason why there wasn't strong action coming out of the G20 because people were not aware that major transactions between large companies were taking place now.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,614,2022-11-18 18:40:06
18001," come out of the G20 because people were not aware that major transactions between large companies were taking place now on Greenhutton that actually this pollution free all the way to the supply chain fuel was now being transacted at multi-billion dollar scale. If that none that I don't believe any sovereign leader or any energy minister or climate change minister could not take ultrasonry that Greenhutton is never here to stay it's broken through history has been made it will never go back. Okay what is the one thing that you would tell leaders today and business leaders? How do we transition faster than what we are now? Because we're at real risk of missing our targets. So that's really simple. You stop funding, you stop subsidising, you stop using money into possible. It could be carbon sequestration, it could be fuel rebates could be anything. Hundreds of billions of dollars getting ashed while we ashed the planet on fossil fuel subsidies because we haven't had that renewable energy, we haven't had that Greenhutton, we've kind of been pushed down, pushed down, it's also some excuses are never be commercial, they're never be supplied in the quantities we needed. Now we know let's take action, it's practical, it's implementable, let's do it now. Okay if we do it now, is there going to be a shock to the energy system? Is there going to be a shock actually to economically and is it worth not talking about transition just going from A to B? Yeah it's a fantastic person, A to B is the solution, let fossil fuels do what fossil fuels do, just burn their coal burn their oil, burn their gas at least they're pumping up carbon and methane into the atmosphere honestly. Well not that honest because they don't mention methane which is 90 times worse than carbon but at least the carbon is being done honestly, encourage the Greenhutton sector to come in really fast, okay it's there, there's there's renewable power all over the world, we know how to make electrolyzes much cheaper like 25% of the original cost, we know how to do that now we don't have an excuse to get into it. Does it need to be cheaper than oil and fossil fuel for it to be viable worldwide? Well right now is, okay so let's just swallow that bit of financial data, right now is cheaper and it's getting more check, it's the own fuel you know, just declining in value. You don't have enough of it right to power the world. Ah yes that's only because we haven't had policies to support, we had policies to support it five, ten years ago it would be everywhere you'd see the global warming budget start to come down. Now we've got five or ten years to make a huge difference and he policy leaders all over the world to appreciate now okay, big business is transacting with Greenhutton in multi-billion dollar agreements, we now know it's here at the state that's spread everywhere. Coming up on the program the hydrogen revolution, we'll speak with the CEO of Italian utility firm Snam about his new book and why he thinks Green Hydrogen will be competitive in just five years. Plus how are airlines working to become more sustainable? We'll look at how Airbus plans to step up in the climate fight. This is Bluebird Green.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,615,2022-11-18 18:44:35
18002,"ight o o......... healthcare. New York, I'm Kayley Lines, and this is Bloomberg Green. What will the world look like in 2050? Will global temperatures have stabilized? Electric vehicles be abundant? And solar and wind power homes around the world? According to Marco Alvera, the CEO of Italian Energy Company Sam, that vision of the future could be a reality. And he says that hydrogen will pave its way. As he tells it in his new book, The Hydrogen Revolution, Alvera's moment of reckoning came in November 2018 when he tasked the Sam Sinerius team with studying how Europe could reduce its CO2 emissions to zero by 2050. Looking through the results of the study, Alvera said he was struck by how much hydrogen was in Europe's energy mixed by that year. Beyond the abundance of hydrogen, the Sam model also predicted that it would be the cheapest form of decarbonized energy for many sectors, and that it could be cheaper than today's prices for oil, coal, and nuclear power. Armeria today has spoke with Alvera at COP26. It's happening all very fast. We see the cost of hydrogen coming down a lot. Hydrogen will play a big role in the energy mix. I don't know if it's going to be 15 or 25% of a fully decarbonized energy system, but it's going to be big. Coss are coming down, and people are waking up to the fact that it's the only way to decarbonize certain sectors, so-called hard-to-abate sectors. And you say it's the only way in the cost are coming down. Where do you see prices moving? Because a lot of the reticence of times has to do with the pricing. Some market will still nod the cheapest option out of the market. So when I was first working in hydrogen in 2004, it was costing $1,000 per megawatt hour, 2010, 600. Today, 100, and we see it going down to 50 and five years' time and to going down to $25 per megawatt hour in the next 10 years or so. Which is a quarter of word as today. That's really because renewable energy, and we're talking green hydrogen here, renewable energy costs are falling. But the cost of making the electrolyzer, which is the kit that you use to convert solar or wind energy and water into hydrogen, the cost of this kit is falling a lot because it doesn't really exist on an industrial scale. So as we build up capacity, we industrialize it, we standardize it, and we squeeze costs out. That's really the cost trajectory. And for that, of course, you need demand, however, for governments and also institutions to kind of buy into this idea that it is a future and we want to invest in creating infrastructure. What are they telling you? When you speak to governments, when you speak to officials, are they keen on this? They're very keen. So the Department of Energy shares our view in the states of getting to below $1 a kilo, which is $25 a megawatt hour. The European Union has a hydrogen strategy, which is very clear, and several member states have the same. Chile wants to export a lot of hydrogen. China's big on hydrogen. Australia's very big on hydrogen. Japan is blending already hydrogen. So I would say the world is now really focused on this because it's the only way to store energy for a long period of time economically is to convert it into either a liquid or a gas. And of course, you talk about the price, but the other big component is the volume, how big can you go? Where do you see that on a time scale? So wherever it's sunny or windy, you can produce very cheap hydrogen.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,616,2022-11-18 18:48:58
18003," And of course you talk about the price but the other big component is the volume you know how big can you go? Where do you see that on a time scale? So wherever it's sunny or windy you can produce very cheap hydrogen eventually and so compared to oil and gas Which are concentrated in a few parts of the world? It's gonna be very democratic from that point of view So every sunny place every desert every ocean wind can be turned into hydrogen that we can put on ships in pipes And really start trading it around the world So it's gonna happen a lot faster than a lot of people think so and and we say a lot faster What is that in time? As they said 50 dollars which is essentially oil parity within five years and then depending on How quickly we ramp it up after that we could get to 25 dollars which is coal parity before the end of the day Big scale in big scale because once you get to coal parity that's the only way we're gonna get China and India To stop burning you coal. We have businesses in China and in India and I see a lot of hydrogen development a lot of renewable development in both countries The Indian announcement was incredibly strong on 2030 some people were upset about the 2017 at zero deadline, but when it comes to 30 he announced a big big commitment to get the 50% renewables I was surprised that they would make it so explicit and even the net zero is a big thing for them And so I think it will happen faster than 2070 because of the falling cost of renewable and Hydrogen India's burning 80 gigawatt of oil diesel to keep the lights on so there's an immediate opportunity there And we're very interested in working that country and with regards to China perhaps the fact that we haven't really seen them active I guess the diplomats are working on this, but we haven't really seen the leadership It's gonna be technology. It's gonna be industry. I think China has committed to a net zero Which is very important at the G20 China was clearly behind the one and a half Degrees so I think a lot has been achieved between the G20 and and cop and I think what's really important is to see in the coming years How quick it's in our hands to make part of this happen in five years or could otherwise happen in 15 20 years It's about building the project the capital is there We we we saw how many trillions of dollars are already committed What's missing is really the projects and that's where companies like us step in Marco Alvera CEO of Snam there speaking with our Maria today Let's turn out to the aviation industry It's a big contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions and it's under pressure to change that in October the International Air Transport Association a trade body representing airlines A proof to target of achieving net zero emissions by 2050 to achieve that many airlines in the US and Europe are looking to buy Sustainable aviation fuel made from renewable sources like used vegetable oil Initiatives like these are pushing plane makers to come up with some radical new aircraft that will eventually cater to our growing appetite for Travel without hurting the environment. We took a look at how Airbus the world's number two aircraft manufacturer is stepping up to the challenge How long until we can fly emission free? Airbus says it's more confident by the day. It can be done by its 2035 target Airbus a CEO spoke about its ambitions for hydrogen powered planes at the company summit in France The physics works hydrogen technologies are not new they are used in in other sectors We use them in space on our rockets and we don't need the laws of physics to change to be able to use hydrogen on our planes So every day we become more confident But we think we need to have a plane we need to have the right fuels the hydrogen available in the right quantity at the right place at the right time And we need the regulations to be ready so we really need the work and the collaboration of many people are on the globe to make it happen on time But it could be a long way to until green passenger jets go mainstream Larger aircraft with more than 150 seats are not expected to feature globally until about 2050 that means manufacturers and airlines today are under growing pressure to ramp up short-term innovations to cut their carbon In a long term meeting the ambitious plans for so-called green hydrogen means building a giant industry almost from scratch To make that happen British airline easy jet is among those saying governments need to get involved and fast Aviation's emissions over the last three decades leading up to the pandemic grew by about 80% to over one gigaton And that's projected to double by 2050",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,617,2022-11-18 18:53:09
18004," The conditions over the last three decades leading up to the pandemic grew by about 80% to over 1 gigaton, and that's projected to double by 2050. According to Bloomberg, NEF, about half of the airlines with the largest global market share have set net zero targets by that same date nearly three decades away. Coming up from Blue Sky projects to the bottom line, we'll speak with our Bloomberg NEF expert Meredith Annex and dig into their models about how hydrogen fits into the future energy mix. This is Bloomberg Green. From Bloomberg's World Headquarters in New York, I'm Kayleigh Lyons, and this is Bloomberg Green. Now let's bring in Meredith Annex. Our Bloomberg NEF Hydrogen Specialists to talk more about how hydrogen could change the energy landscape. So Meredith, what place do you think hydrogen is likely to have in the future energy mix globally? Hydrogen is this incredible solution for us as we look to decarbonize because it's a perfect solution in areas that are hard to electrify. So we're really like to think about hydrogen playing a role. It's in things like heavy industry, especially where you need a feedstock as well as energy source, and in things like dispatchable power, long-called transport, maybe even shipping and aviation. That sounds great that it can be used for such diverse industries. At the end of the day, though, how much is this going to cost? Well, that's the amazing thing about hydrogen because depending on how you make it, it can actually see significant costs of clients in the future. So when we're talking about clean hydrogen, we usually mean green hydrogen produced from renewable electricity. And in that case, your hydrogen is almost as cheap as the renewables that are used to make it. So if you're in a place with really good renewable resources, you'll be able to have cheaper hydrogen. But even in places with less good resources, we think that hydrogen can be cheaper than a dollar per kilogram, which is the price of unavated hydrogen today, and around $8 per million BTUs for those who prefer to think in energy units. And that can be achieved anywhere in the world by 2050, we believe. All right, so let's talk about kind of the pros and cons list. I don't know where cost fits into that, but what are the advantages to hydrogen over other renewables and then what are the drawbacks? Yeah, main advantage is the fact that hydrogen can",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,618,2022-11-18 18:57:36
18005," fits into that. But what are the advantages to hydrogen over other renewables and then what are the drawbacks? Yeah. Main advantage is the fact that hydrogen can serve roles that electron struggle with. And that's things like seasonal storage, for instance, or just anything where you need the storeability, where your electrons are harder to store, hydrogen is going to be easier. That also leads to a downside though, because hydrogen is less energy dense than the usual things that we use for storeable energy today like coal or oil or natural gas. So you will need more volume of storage to handle the same amount of energy. Let's talk about the viability as well and how it may differ in different geographies. What is your view on that? Yeah. So for green hydrogen again from renewable electricity, really places with the best renewable resources, things like Latin America or the Middle East, even southern Europe have really, really good potential for producing hydrogen. And then when you're looking at blue hydrogen, which is produced from natural gas or coal with carbon-caption storage, we do see that becoming more expensive than green hydrogen in the future, especially as renewable electricity costs come down. But that can be a viable option in places like the US Gulf Coast or Russia, where you've got good geological storage for the carbon, as well as ample natural gas that's quite cheap. All right, great breakdown. Thank you so much to our Meredith Annex, our Bloomberg NEF Hydrogen Specialist. And of course, you can get more from the Bloomberg NEF team on the terminal and online. And they've recently done a podcast called Hydrogen 101 as part of its switched on series. So from iron ore titans pivoting to cleaner energy to talk of a hydrogen revolution, that's it from this week's edition of Bloomberg Green. We'll be back next week with a deep dive into the state of electric vehicles. And you can keep the conversation going by following us on YouTube, Instagram and Twitter at climate. I'm Kayleigh Lines from Bloomberg's World Headquarters in New York. And this is Bloomberg Green. This is Bloomberg Business Week. Inside from the reporters and editors who bring you America's most trusted business magazine, plus global business, finance and tech news as it happens. Bloomberg Business Week with Carol Maser and Bloomberg Quick Takes Tim Stenevick on Bloomberg Radio. And a very good afternoon everybody live in the Bloomberg Interactive Broker Studio streaming on YouTube. We are on Bloomberg Quick Takes in. We're in May to this Friday. Wait, you got Quick Takes to Taylor Swift? No, which my daughter's like, hey mom, I thought we were just getting these tickets. Okay, I thought that's what you meant that we'd made it. No, no. But so to like, there's to be continued. Yeah, we're gonna talk about this. We're gonna unpack that one. It is Friday November, yeah, 18th. We're on track for Down Week in stocks after last week, supercharged rally. So is it fierce over?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,619,2022-11-18 19:01:54
18006," No, we're going to talk about this. We're going to unpack that one. It is Friday, November, yeah, 18th. We're on track for Down Week in stocks after last week, supercharged rally. So is it fears over higher interest rates still coming? The Fed speakers all remind us concerns over recession or both. We're going to kind of get the Vulcan mind-meld in just a moment. We're looking forward to that. Leaning in, well, falling in a big time, to crypto today. We're going to be talking all about what's going on with the great gut check on past comments by SBF about FTX and also some of the red flags that a lot of people miss. But in hindsight, duh. I know, duh. Indeed. Annie Maasa, great story and the team putting that one out. We're going to talk about blockchain and sports engagement and monetization, the latest episode of Tim and Katie's crypto-IRF. Yeah, we talk a little bit about crime in crypto. So looking forward to that one. Yeah. No. Yeah, we do. OK. We're also going to talk about ultimatums and vulnerabilities. We're talking Elon and Twitter. And then we've got the CEO of carparts.com. We're going to talk about the car market. All of that to come. We begin though with a check on the trading day. Here's Charlie better. I think very much, Tim, looking at a mixed Friday here, we made it. Indeed, we've got the Dow higher. S&P NASDAQ, they're both on the minus side. S&P little change down by one point. But first, developing story. Twitter owner Elon Musk has sent out an email to all of the social media platforms, software engineers, requesting that they report to the company San Francisco headquarters for a meeting at 2 p.m. local time today, urging employees to fly to the Bay Area to be present in person, only those who cannot physically get to San Francisco or who have family emergencies are excused, this according to Musk in the email, which was viewed by Bloomberg. Again, we've got stocks trading little change right now, at least on the S&P. Oil futures are falling a day after Federal Reserve policymakers disabused optimistic investors of the notion that interest rates will abate soon. The 10-year yield 3.81% the two-year 4.50% again, the S&P up half a point NASDAQ down 49 down, 5 tens of 1%, the Dow up 64 up by 2 tens of 1%. Spot goal down 6 tens of 1%, 17 49 the ounce, and West Texas, in a media crude now down 3.1%, 79 12 a barrel on WTI. Well, as for the market backdrop, given what's going on with the Federal Reserve, Subundra, Rijapa, is head of US rate strategy at Societage General. Anytime you see an inflection point in the data, you're seeing the sort of rally in risky assets, you're seeing financial conditions start to ease, we're seeing mortgage rates come off quite meaningfully in the last week or so. So under these circumstances, you tend to see risk taking coming back to the markets. The US Justice Department is investigating ticket masters, parent company, live nation, and this according to the New York Times, citing sources familiar with the matter, and last check on live nation, that stock is declining, live nation shares, so right now down by 7.2%. Recapping the S&P now higher by one point, I'm Charlie Palatine, that is a Bloomberg business flash. All right, Charlie, so much for a slow Friday, because there's a lot going on. All right, let's get to the Market Drivers Report. Let's set the business week agenda on this Friday and in the house, Interactive Booker Studio, Bloomberg Market's correspondent, Kriida Gupta to my right, to my left, is Bloomberg News Market's reporter Abigail DuLil. I have to say, it does feel like Kriida, kind of a mellow day. It does, but here we go. It does and it does not. So look, we started off the stock market open. I want to say over 1% gains at the open. To me, I think the game changer here isn't what you're seeing in the equity market or even the bond market. It's in the commodities market. And I think the rest of the asset classes are kind of taking their cue from that now. A really big question that Alex Steele has asked me over and over again is, what is the tipping point between inflation concerns and growth concerns? And it kind of feels like today. What do you mean by that? So this idea here, that inflation that keeps rising driven by perhaps higher oil prices, higher food prices, the sticky stuff that's really going to show up into average Americans, bottom line, their budgets, their incomes, that's the stuff that you're really going to see way on the economy. As opposed to inflation decelerating, but then a recession causing growth to really pull back in the economy, which then feeds back into lower oil prices, lower food prices.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,620,2022-11-18 19:06:13
18007," to inflation decelerating, but then a recession causing growth to really pull back in the economy, which then feeds back into lower oil prices, lower food prices, et cetera, at least on the contract level, as opposed to the grocery store. This is tricky though. This is why the Fed is in a tough spot. We talk about hopefully, you know, coming out within a soft landing, but this is not an exact sign. Yeah, and there's two different traits because if you believe inflation is strong and it's going to keep accelerating at the peak, it's not in the rear view mirror, then commodities are going to move higher and risk is going to move lower. The flip side of that is if you're worried about growth, commodities come down. And right now, you're seeing Brent crude really take a pretty big tumble down to $87 a barrel there on a handle, not much fruit dropping below $80 to a 79 handle. And the reason I point this out and so important is because when you have risk assets rallying together, it's kind of seen as a healthy gauge. The stock market in line with the commodity market. We haven't seen that with the market trading with inflation. The idea here being the higher inflation is going to eat into S&P 500 profits. Now you're seeing a logical trade. Yeah, now you're kind of seeing a reversion. Maybe Abby can speak to us a little bit of oil and stocks, maybe moving together, also perhaps people cashing out ahead of the weekend. Q Abigail. I don't know. I think that sometimes there's maybe a little bit too much analysis that goes into things. And I guess the way that I think about it in terms of oil traditionally is as a risk asset. And so to the point that Crety and Alex were talking about between growth and inflation, the tipping point will be if oil really breaks down, which is pretty close to doing. If that were to occur, then I think that it's going to be an all out risk. You mean breaking down fund technically? Technically. Yeah, it's almost below its recent low. And if that happens, I think that you could see a big risk asset sell off. Now the thing is commodities tend to lead equities, but even by weeks or months. So if there are some sort of a collapse in commodities, which certainly hasn't happened, there's been a very orderly sell off this year, then I would think that that would be another shot across the bow that you're going to have some difficult trading ahead for stocks. Hey, speaking of stocks, Abigail, volume is down. I mean, we're talking like, is it already a holiday week? 25%? It's funny. I'm looking at that. What's going on? Well, it is down 25%. Below the 20 day moving average. And Carol, you started off asking, is there anything going on? And I asked Carol the same question outside the studio. I was like, kind of a snooze. Yeah. Well, one of my reports earlier on Bloomberg television was how the news is, there's not much happening. So, okay, good. I mean, sometimes that is news. We know. Yeah. We were not supposed to say that, but when it's the, when it is really the case, it's news. But those numbers don't lie. I mean, do we have to, I don't know, this could go to either of you about the options expiration today, right? Triple-witching. Do we expect a little volatility at the end? I don't think so. Truthfully, I mean, looking at the volume right now, it would be sort of shocking if we saw any sort of pickup. It feels very logical to me in that, okay, to Nick, first of all, we had an incredible, as I could say, an Uber run up in stocks last week. So a little bit of a breather. We're at the tail end of earnings. Our next Fed, we're getting ready for our last Fed meeting of the year, which is December 14th. So we're about a month away. Like, it's just that kind of wrap up feel. And I feel like, unless you start to see major recaculations when it comes to earnings outlooks, I feel like maybe this is the trade for a little while. It kind of seems like that. Remember my commodity start to break down dramatically. I remember Mike Wilson made this point. He said, look, you're waiting for the pivot between Federal Reserve, like pushing the markets and driving the markets to earnings, driving the markets. And I think a lot of people expected that pivot to happen in October. And I did it because we're still kind of on the Fed's whim here. No surprise. The earnings point, I mean, you're seen on an individual basis, and really punishing and positive reactions in that regard as well, especially for those companies that boost their full year guidance. Those are really getting rewarded. Seven, eight percent moves. Yeah. But ones that cut it really getting punished to the downside. But once again, that pivot that he's talking about hasn't quite hit yet. Yeah, I think about this week alone, TJ Maxx, doing okay, Cisco doing okay, and then you had right exactly. So even saving the last 15 seconds for you. Well, I actually, you took me off guard a moment ago. It's not triple-witching today. That's in December. Yeah.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,621,2022-11-18 19:10:32
18008," And you had right exactly. So even saving the last 15 seconds for you. Well, actually, you took me off guard a moment ago. It's not triple witching today. That's in December. Oh. So it's the third Friday of, that's why when you're saying that, somebody was like, is this a trick question? I'm not sure. I'm not sure. But for some reason, thought that. But the other thing is on a triple witching day, you would see the huge volume on the open. There's a little bit of volume on the open. But a triple witching day is a lot different than today. I believe this is a news box. I blame those two helping s of lunch that you had. I do. Come on, man. So give them a break. I coulda goop to Abigail. Do a little. Thank you so much. All right. Let's get to world. The National News Denise Pelegrini is on it. Hey, Denise. They made me take two. But we're still doing on here. New York Congressman Hakeem Jeffries will his officially seeking to replace house speaker Nancy Pelosi as Democratic leader as she steps down.

I'm Denise Pellegrini, and this is Bloomberg. All right, Denise. Thank you so much, Denise Pellegrini, with World of National News from our Bloomberg Newsroom. So we talked about volume being light in terms of the trade here, and that makes maybe some sense as we get ready for a holiday week next week and get into the weekend. But I will say, when it comes to news, I can't almost every day, I think, this week, when I would look at the most red on the Bloomberg, whether it was in the past eight hours or past one hour, it was all about FTX and Sam Bankman Fried. And I got to say, this includes this next story, which today, which I, it's a story I love, and it's a must read. It is a most red on the Bloomberg. It is about what FTX is, Sam Bankman Fried said when we asked him our Bloomberg team, asked him about some different things, and the red flags that were raised over the summer. So delighted to have back with us. Bloomberg News Investing Reporter Annie Moss, so she's been all over this story. She's back in our Bloomberg Interactive Brokers Studio. Love this story. Feel like it's so important, right? When we're like kind of now looking back. So first of all, tell us about the story and how you guys laid it out. So back in August, I was working with Hannah Miller and Anna Arrera here at Bloomberg, and we were just kind of talking about how something was fishy with FTX. And at the time, SBF was on this mega buying spree. He was buying up all these bankrupt companies and just throwing money left and right. And we just sort of started to like the more we looked into FTX, the more we were like, where's he getting all this money? What's going on here? And what on earth is this company, Alameda, that's operating on the side that he also owns? And none of this was like, it was known that Alameda existed and was out there, but there seemed to be some pretty glaring conflicts of interest. So we thought that we could write a story about how in traditional finance, that's not really kosher. It's not really copacetic to have a market maker kind of operating under the same umbrella as an exchange. Sure enough, here we are after interviewing him about it in August, and it's all over the news. In hindsight, I mean, this was just the tip of the iceberg, this hunch, this kind of fishing-ness. That's right. So in hindsight, it was really just the tip of the iceberg. What was actually happening?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,622,2022-11-18 19:14:54
18009," this kind of fishingness. That's right. So in hindsight, it was really just the tip of the iceberg. What was actually happening? So OK, so it raises the question, Annie, about if you're a company, a very venture capital firm, and you go out and you're looking for investments, you have certain types of due diligence. And oftentimes, what you do is you look at the makeup of the board, for example, or you look at balance sheets. And you dig under the hood. Journalists don't necessarily get to do that when they're interviewing subjects, unless they get access to those things. What adventure capital's miss? Why did venture capital's miss this? I mean, one big thing venture capital missed was that the auditor, first of all, not all pieces of this empire were audited, but a piece that was, was audited by like, this was a $32 billion company. And they had an auditor that was so far from anyone's radar that was like the first auditor in the metaverse. Like, you know, I mean, no matter what you think of the metaverse, that should send up a red flag to you if you're a venture capital. Even Zuckerberg would come out and say, hey, we're still working this up. Yeah, exactly. Like, you're like, you have to think. I was the first auditor in the metaverse. I would think you could come out. Exactly. So that's a red flag. But then, I mean, digging a little bit deeper, the relationship between Alameda and FTX should have been a red flag. And it was out there. It was in the white paper that FTX put out about it. It's exchanged that it has Alameda in the background. And by the way, Alameda was founded before FTX. There was a clear linkage there. So I mean, these are all things like, you'd at least at a minimum want to know, like, what kind of access does Alameda have to your exchange data? Like, information on your customers and what they're doing. I mean, to say nothing of like sending money from FTX to Alameda, which is outlandish. Well, it's kind of amazing. I do love this story. Everybody should read it. Just go to Blumbering.com. But it's interesting. Like, you say on FTX's relationship with Alameda, Bankman Fried said over the summer, as of today, there isn't that much of one there. So maybe, who knows? Maybe at that point, it was. I don't know. No, I think basically at this point, we cannot believe anything he ever said on the record or ever. But looking back on his comments, it was kind of like, it was astonishing because we asked him very specific questions about the relationship between these two firms and where he lived, for example, and he wasn't able to answer anything. Well, help me out with it. Because going back to what Tim says, and we've been talking about this all week, that venture capitalists tend to love these crazy people that often look a little bit offbeat and are seen as geniuses and brilliant, right? And are OK with it and the quirkiness. And yet, as you guys lay out, the living arrangements for FTX and Alameda employees, that he couldn't really answer where he lived or slept. Are you looking back? Is it just like, wait a minute, this is a simple question. Yeah, there are pretty simple questions that I don't think people were really asking him or they didn't care. And to your point about how he looked and acted, I think sometimes there's a group thing that goes on with VCs or anyone, but you think, oh, well, I've seen genius look like this before in, for example, a Mark Zuckerberg. Like someone who's not flashy, handsome, dashing, you know, good, which is worth. And media gets into it too. Yes, of course, of course. Because we love a story. Correct. But I will say, to your point, I think you're spot on. Someone like Mark Zuckerberg, think about Facebook's origin story, right? A bunch of folks drop out of Harvard. They move to California. They all live together. Right. Like their college roommates of some sort. You've seen a work before. Go back further. Apple, right? And a garage in Cupertino, those sorts of things. So it makes sense in hindsight. But at the time, it's not necessarily glaring. That's true. I mean, yeah, a more charitable interpretation is like any startup begins from, you know, humble origins by definition. And I think what maybe broke down along the way is how fast, how rapidly this thing was growing, right? So it took many years for Apple to become Apple. It took many years for Amazon to become Amazon. And this crypto thing, and maybe there was no frame of reference on how fast something could grow. But things were moving progressing really fast. F-T-X started.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,623,2022-11-18 19:19:21
18010," 2019, right? And now it's, as of this year, it was a $32 billion company, you know, just throwing out cash on all these, all these various types of investments. So I mean, that rapid growth, maybe they thought was the new normal for crypto or something that they couldn't miss. But it does kind of give you pause looking back, any looking back. And of course, you know, Monday morning, quarterbacking, what would you have maybe pushed him further on or our team should have pushed him further on or just media in general and investors should have pushed him further on or what would you have asked differently? That's a really good question. I mean, I think that all journalists are thinking so many journalists had exposure to him or gave him exposure to the world. And it's a bit of a soul searching moment for the industry about the exposure that he got. I'm proud of the questions we asked him. I never interviewed SBF other than this interview to ask about Alameda. But of course, I wish I had figured out that he was siphoning funds, perhaps like, right? Or, or, you know, even some of the, even some of the like daisier stuff under the hood. Of course, you know, even looking back at what we printed, like, we took certain things to be true that he said about like how the business was doing, right? We, you know, we said that he said that it earned a certain amount of money. And now in the bankruptcy filings, even, even John Ray says, I don't know if any of the financials I have on his car. Formerly, we're seeing Enron, formerly oversaw the liquidation of Enron and is now overseeing the same liquidation of FTX said, I've never seen like a situation like this. I'm not sure if I can trust the financials that I have in front of me. So knowing, knowing what we know now and all the reporting that you've done and that others have done what you've read about what, what Sam Bakeman-Freed has said, what are some, I don't want to use the term lie because, you know, there are different, there are different things associated with lying. But I mean, what are some things that you've saw that he said that were definitely not true? I mean, definitely not true. He told us on the record that there wasn't, there wasn't really a relationship between FTX and Alameda. We know that that's absolutely unequivocally false. No way was that true. He talked about his living arrangements, he couldn't really answer. So it's hard to know, I mean, I don't think at all anymore that he like quickly had changed his living arrangements like no way. He said, I mean this is one of the funny ones. He said that by some measures like they are the most regulated exchange in the world, which is hilarious. I mean, it was even hilarious then, like to suggest that this this offshore exchange, crypto exchange in the Bahamas, like has any level of like, I've covered exchanges, they have a lot of rules. And that's a feature not a bug of putting it in a certain place. I mean, if you wanted to be regulated, you put in your place, it gets ready. They moved the whole operation. They moved Alameda from California to Hong Kong and then to the Bahamas. All right, Annie, thank you so much. Great story. Our Annie Masa, a Bloomberg news. We do want to take you to the Justice Department where the Attorney General Merrick Garland getting ready to make some announcements. And let's take you there. As described in court filings in the District of Columbia, is the investigation into into whether any person or entity unlawfully interfered with the transfer of power following the 2020 presidential election or the certification of the Electoral College vote held on or about January 6, 2021. The second is the ongoing investigation involving classified documents and other presidential records, as well as the possible obstruction of that investigation referenced and described in court filings in a pending matter in the Southern District of Florida. I'm joined today by Deputy Attorney General Lee Samaniko, US Attorney for the District of Columbia, Matthew Graves, and Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Vision, Kenneth Pallete. Assistant Attorney General for National Security, Matthew Olson could not be here. He is currently in Germany representing the Department at the G7, Home Affairs, and Security Ministerial. US Attorney Graves has been able leading the investigations into the events leading up to",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,624,2022-11-18 19:23:36
18011," Department at the G7, Home Affairs, and Security Ministerial. U.S. Attorney Graves has been able leading the investigations into the events leading up to and on January 6. He and dozens of assistant U.S. attorneys and other prosecutors have taken on the monumental task of conducting over 900 prosecutions in defense of our democratic institutions. Criminal division prosecutors under the able leadership of Assistant Attorney General Pallit have played a significant role in those prosecutions. Assistant Attorney General Olson has been able leading the team responsible for investigating the matter involving classified documents and other presidential records, as well as the possible obstruction of that investigation. All of the career prosecutors assigned to these matters are conducting their work in the best traditions of the Department of Justice. I also want to recognize the efforts of the many FBI agents and other law enforcement personnel who are assigned to these matters. They are working courageously and steadfastly and are serving our nation honorably. I am grateful to them we all are. The Department of Justice has long recognized that in certain extraordinary cases it is in the public interest to appoint a special prosecutor to independently manage an investigation and prosecution. Based on recent developments, including the former president's announcement that he has a candidate for president in the next election and the sitting president stated intention to be a candidate as well, I have concluded that it is in the public interest to appoint a special counsel. Such an appointment underscores the Department's commitment to both independence and accountability in particularly sensitive matters. It also allows prosecutors and agents to continue their work expeditiously and to make decisions indisputably guided only by the facts and the law. The special counsel will conduct parts of the first investigation I just mentioned. The investigation into whether any person or entity unlawfully interfered with the transfer of power following the 2020 presidential election or with the certification of electoral college vote held on or about January 6. This does not include prosecutions that are currently pending in the district of Columbia or future investigations and prosecutions of individuals for offenses committed while they were physically present on the capital grounds on January 6. Those investigations and prosecutions will remain under the authority of the U.S. attorney for the district of Columbia. The special counsel will also conduct the investigation involving classified documents and other presidential records as well as the possible obstruction of that investigation. Today I signed an order appointing Jack Smith to serve as special counsel. The order authorizes him to continue the ongoing investigation into both of the matters that I have just described and to prosecute any federal crimes that may arise from those investigations. Mr. Smith is a veteran career prosecutor. He began his prosecutorial career in 1994 as an assistant district attorney with the New York County DA's office. In 1999 he became an assistant U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York where over the course of nine years he prosecuted matters ranging from gang murders of police officers to civil rights violations. From 2008 to 2010 he served with the International Criminal Court where he supervised war crimes investigations. In 2010 Mr. Smith returned to the Justice Department to serve as chief of the public integrity section where he led a team of more than 30 prosecutors who handled public corruption and election crimes cases across the United States. In 2015 he agreed to serve as the first assistant U.S. attorney for the middle district of Tennessee later becoming the acting United States attorney. Most recently Mr. Smith served as a chief prosecutor for the special court in the Hague charge with investigating and adjudicating war crimes in Kosovo. Mr. Smith will begin his work as special counsel.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,625,2022-11-18 19:27:55
18012," prosecutor for the special court in the Hague charge with investigating and adjudicating war crimes in Kosovo. Mr. Smith will begin his work as special counsel immediately and will be returning to the United States from the Hague. Throughout his career, Jack Smith has built a reputation as an impartial and determined prosecutor who leads teams with energy and focus to follow the facts wherever they lead. As special counsel, he will exercise independent prosecutorial judgment to decide whether charges should be brought. Although the special counsel will not be subject to the day-to-day supervision of any official of the department, he must comply with the regulations, procedures, and policies of the department. I will ensure that the special counsel receives the resources to conduct this work quickly and completely. During the work to date and Mr. Smith's prosecutorial experience, I am confident that this appointment will not slow the completion of these investigations. The men and women who are pursuing these investigations are conducting themselves in accordance with the highest standards of professionalism. I could not be prouder of them. I strongly believe that the normal processes of this department can handle all investigations with integrity. And I also believe that appointing a special counsel at this time is the right thing to do. The extraordinary circumstances presented here demanded. Mr. Smith is the right choice to complete these matters in an even-handed and urgent manner. Thank you all. All right, everybody. That, of course, was U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland speaking from the Department of Justice, the headline from his announcement, the U.S. Justice Department, appointing a special counsel to oversee criminal investigations related to former President Donald Trump. Now that he is making a third run for the White House in 2024, that was certainly something that was pointed out and isolated by the Attorney General. Let's get some analysis of those comments. Yeah, let's bring in Bloomberg's sound on host Joe Matthew from the Bloomberg 991 studio in Washington, D.C. Joe, good to have you with us this afternoon. I think many people are pretty shocked to see Merrick Garland come out just now and hear these words come out of his mouth. Talk about your reaction and especially the timing of this just days after President Trump announced his third candidacy for President. Yeah, it's all about timing. If he hadn't jumped in, we may not have heard what we just heard, or at least not yet. But this is kind of a classic Friday news dump, right? Everyone's kind of left town already. Lawmakers were back around for a minute, but it's a ghost town today. Perfect opportunity for Merrick Garland to hit the podium here. And naming Jack Smith as the special counsel. That's going to be a never be a household name. Incidentally, there was almost no one in the room for that. It was a late scheduled briefing and not a lot of reporters around even. But this is really changing the contours already of a 2024 race that has barely begun. Hey, this is key. And I think as Bloomberg listeners or Bloomberg watchers on YouTube and Quick Take, because it's very easy for something in terms of the timing for this to happen just after the former president is announcing another run at the White House, that it could come out to seem to be very political. You're saying that this would have probably happened no matter what, whether or not he made another run? Well, I'm not sure the timing certainly has to do with that. If he hadn't made another run, it just, it depends. They've got a lot of investigations going here. And you were already dealing with a former president of the United States. A lot of concern about whether an indictment would be appropriate. So I think the Attorney General here, who's, by the way, about to be from what we understand, there's going to be an impeachment process that could actually emerge soon when Republicans take the House. They are not fans of Merrick Garland. You're saying an impeachment of President Biden, correct? Of actually Merrick Garland, but also they have threatened impeachment proceedings for the President, for the Attorney General, and for the Secretary of Homeland Security. It's unclear that any of those will actually happen, but that's the messaging we've heard from the incoming majority here. So Merrick Garland, it's an extraordinary move to go to a special counsel. It indicates the incredibly delicate situation that they're in. Does it indicate anything about the evidence that the government has?

18014," the night before the world ending or something like that. But Twitter is working, everything we are hearing and reporting is that there is a lot of concern that because there's been so many people who have left that eventually there's going to be this technical cascade, that maybe one part of the service is going to have a bug and it's going to lead to other features not working and that eventually we're going to start to see like long outages or it's certainly going to be hard for them to ship any new features because they're going to be just in maintenance mode this whole time. But for today of course, it seems to still be working and I certainly hope that's the case going forward. It does feel though like this is going to be something that that slowly starts to happen over the next couple weeks. I mean, how do we, I mean, not a publicly held company so it's kind of weird now. We don't have perhaps the transparency visibility and right Ealing can kind of say whatever he wants. It feels like about this company. But what are you hearing from folks who are inside the company and for those of us who use Twitter, you know, about kind of the reliability of this platform? Yeah, I mean, these concerns, the ones that I just shared with you are coming from those people, right? Like these are people who are much smarter about the engineering and about the tech than I am, right? And they're leaving the company and they're saying we're not sure who's left, right? Like, hey, I was on a team that helped, you know, keep the timeline running and everyone on my team has gone, right? Like that's the kind, those are the kinds of stories that we're starting to hear from people, right? And I think the argument from, you know, supporters of Elon has been, well, Twitter used to be much smaller than it is now and it was still able to operate. And that's of course very true. But I think it's very different to, you know, build up to, let's say, 2000 employees versus start at 7,000 and then rip 5,000 of those people out within a two-week stretch, right? It just creates a lot of chaos and uncertainty. And so, you know, this is where the concern lies that maybe the product isn't going to be as stable as it should be. And there was a really kind of a side story. Was it Jaguar Land Rover, Terry Crude, Fire Twitter and Facebook workers? I mean, there's companies at there saying, you know, on a city of San Francisco, right? It's coming out and saying, hey, we've got 4,500 open positions. I would imagine though, Kurt, that those positions don't pay what, you know, Twitter would pay for engineers. Kurt, I don't know how everyone's supposed to go to the office today if the office is closed. Yeah, you and me both, right? So last night, there was a company-wide email that said, we're closing the offices, we're restricting bad access. And the explanation I got from some folks who received that email was that they don't exactly know who still works for Twitter right now, because so many people, you know, didn't accept the Musk's ask to be hardcore. And so, they're sort of sifting through like, okay, who actually still works here. So, for example, folks who are not planning to work at Twitter any longer still have access to their email. They still have access to Slack, things like that. And so, thinking was they closed the office in order to sort of figure out, okay, you know, who should still have access to this so we don't have broken employees kind of coming in. But, you know, then he says today, hey, everyone needs to show up on the 10th floor to have an in-person meeting. And it's like, well, which one is it? Is the office closed and bad access is revoked? Or is everyone supposed to be there in person today? It's just, it's so confusing and chaotic right now, guys. And it's people who work at Twitter are really frustrated. As you can imagine with everything that's been going on. Well, you have to wonder what, listen, I know Elon is a smart dude, but you have to wonder. He paid $44 billion with this company, right? And it feels like the value potentially, as a publicly held company, would be, you know, continuing to go to the downside just 20 seconds. I mean, do we have any idea of what his longer term thinking is here just quickly? No, quick answers. No, I really don't. I mean, he's talked a lot about maybe building payments in the Twitter that's about as detailed as I could call it right now. I'm just chuckling, Kirk, because I'm thinking about your weekend that's going to be doing a lot of work. Well, weekend, weekend or their weekends or holidays anymore. I don't think that's it. Not for you or Twitter employees or Elon Musk or Kurt or Kurt. All right, Kurt Wagner, technology reporter, Pover news via Zoom from San Francisco. Let's get to world of national news. Denise Pelligrini standing by in our newsroom. Hey, Denise. Hey, there, you know, there are a lot of poems out there on Twitter about Twitter things like their ones was a side called Twitter. It started out nice, but got bitter. All right. Anyway, let's get to what's happening at the justice.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,628,2022-11-18 19:41:07
18015," But God bitter. All right. Anyway, let's get to what's happening at the Justice Department. The U.S. Justice Department is appointed a special counsel, John Smith now. He will be overseeing criminal investigations related to former President Trump as the former president makes a third run for the White House in 2024. Here is AG, Marik Garland. Is the right choice to complete these matters in an even-handed and urgent manner? Thank you all. And Garland speaking there as Smith takes on oversight of investigations into the January 6th insurrection, including any role that Trump may have played as well as the former president's handling of classified White House records after a left office. We're tracking it all for you here on Bloomberg Radio. New York Congressman Hakeem Jeffries officially seeking to replace House Speaker Nancy Pelosi as Democratic leader Jeffries is the fourth ranking House Democrat if his bid is successful. He'll become the first Black lawmaker to lead a party in Congress. President Biden expressing some hope you may find food prices coming down. He commented while meeting with business and labor leaders at the White House. Inflation to the grocery store is coming down slightly. Prices for things like clothes and television and appliances are going down as well as we head into the holidays. The president does so they'll take the president does so say though that it will take time to get prices and inflation back down to normal levels. And the number of RSV cases in New York City continues to rise. There's been an 800 percent increase in cases of the respiratory virus in the past two months.

So if you didn't notice World Cup, it's happening. It is. You know it's not happening. Alcohol. Yeah, drinking beer at the World Cup. It is. You know, in Qatar. It is. But you know it's these types of things that you know could be decided years ahead of time. Yeah. Before stadium is built or before sponsors are secured. That I think are leaving people a little kind of with with lash right? Yeah, because I would say that when people are watching football, I mean not the American football just to put it out there. That has beer. Okay. I mean tailgating a lot of beer. Yeah, that has a lot of beer. That's funny. But anyway, Qatar's reversal on an agreement to let Anheuser-Busch in Bev sell Budweiser beer inside World Cup football stadiums throwing a wrench into the brand's marketing plans at the last minute. You know, you think about these big sport events, whether it's the Super Bowl, whether the Olympics, I mean anything, right? There's iconic brands that, you know, rally and use those opportunities as great advertising opportunities and marketing opportunities. So you know this deal was lined up a while ago and then it's like, wait, wait, what? Right. So it's a marketing aspect of this and then also what it means for fans with concessions, right? The decisions likely going to result in moving concession can, concession stands serving alcohol even further away from the stadiums. The tournament is typically the world's largest sporting event and a decade in the planning at Kix off Sunday. The host taken on Ecuador. Yeah, exactly. The move also highlighting misunderstandings among the world's largest brewer, the conservative Muslim country and FIFA, the international governing body of football over a partnership global data said was worth 72 million dollars and to be fairs are reporting rights and points out it also paints a be in in Bev into a corner since the brewer is unlikely to want to start a big public spat with the secretive football body and the host nation just as this tournament gets underway. It's the world's biggest sporting event in a global marketing bananza, but not for that. Okay, a be in Bev may lose out on potential business and stadiums such sales are not the main goal of these kinds of deals in the run up to the World Cup Budweiser launch to marketing campaign based on its sponsorship. So it's not just about the event. It's about the run up to. Yeah, I mean, it's a lot, but anyway, interesting story. Find more at BlueBurg.com.

Honeywell says the pact is subject to approval from the court. Right now we have got Honeywell shares that are trading lower by 5.10s of 1%. It is a mixed day, very similar to our last update with the Dow hire, S&P hire barely, little changed on the S&P up by 1 point right now on that stack. Those remain lower by 53 points down by about 5.10s of 1%. Stocks treading water, oil futures are falling.

All right Charlie, thank you so much. Well, COP 2027 we know wrapping up in Egypt a lot of headlines came out of that and with that as a backdrop, there's a story you'll find in the new issue of Bloomberg Business Week magazine that's now out on new stands online and on the Bloomberg. It is about the nation caught in the crosshairs of climate change that's getting rich and here's the kick on oil. It's getting rich on coil. The story happens to also be the Bloomberg big take today. The story written by Monterey, real senior investigations reporter at Bloomberg News. He joins us via zoom from Chicago also with us this afternoon is Joel Weber. He's the editor of Bloomberg Business Week. He's with us in the Bloomberg Interactive Brokers studio. Joel, I want to start off with you because it is today's big take. It's in the upcoming issue or the current issue of Bloomberg Business Week magazine. It's the the nation is between a rock and a hard place right now because so drill for oil and hope for the best and that's basically what the I think the story really boils into and that is in an incredible paradox. As Monterey writes the coastline of this city of this country is actually below sea level so rising seas present obviously a huge challenge. It is historically one of the poorest countries in the world and yet with this deal with X on they find themselves like potentially you know with kind of a one shot at a non-onormous amount of wealth and could pull themselves out of that poverty but to do so also means that here we are in the world of climate change and it puts the whole country at Jeopardy to walk this path. So Monterey, incredible story. How is this country which we call the last petro state? How is it navigating this challenge because this has been a long time in the making and only now have they really started to accelerate how much oil they're extracting from the country? Yeah so this discovery of all this oil came in 2015 so it's been about seven years now and I think just to put this in a little bit of context, Guyana is really really small. There's only about 800,000 people in the whole country and to put its economy in perspective the size of its economy and the economic output traditionally has been about you know one-tenth of an average American mid-sized city so it's a very very small economy we're talking about and this is a huge you know windfall of oil. It's billions of barrels of it and so the leaders of Guyana you know looked at this potential windfall which is you know potentially worth hundreds of billions of dollars and politically they could not pass up the chance to drill this and so they began drilling about three years ago and since then Guyana has become the fastest growing economy in the world. It's capital budget just in the last year I think grew more than a hundred percent and so with all of this growth though there are critics who are saying that the oil drilling has kind of spun out of control already. There's a lot of complaints that environmental regulations have kind of been tossed to the waste side and there's a lot of criticism of the contract itself with Exxon-Mobile which is drilling new oil. A lot of people say that the terms of that contract were lobsighted in favor of the company at the expense of the residents of country. Hey Monty I was pretty struck when you wrote about the ecology of the island and what what there is in the rainforest where people don't live. Talk a little bit about what you see there and and and really this area of the world and what it has to offer. Yeah so Guyana.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,631,2022-11-18 19:54:08
18018," Rainforest where people don't live. Talk a little bit about what you see there and really this area of the world and what it has to offer. Yeah, so Guyonet is, you know, it is one of the most partially populated countries in the Western hemisphere. And, you know, part of the reason for that is of those 800,000 people, 90% of them live right along the coast in a narrow strip. And so a lot of the interior of the country is forest. It's about 85% covered in forest. And so there are just the unbelievably beautiful parts of Guyonet. There are these, you know, big plateaus with waterfalls, you know, there's all sorts of endangered species there. So it's really this kind of ecological treasure. Right. And one of the ironies of the story is that Guyonet before they embraced drilling oil, they were seen as a country that was really leading efforts at conservation and ecological confiscation particularly. So, want to help me out here because in your report, and you say that Guyonet's leaders have promised to create a different kind of petrostat, an environmentally sustainable one that uses oil revenue to build a more durable infrastructure powered by renewable energy. Are they not doing that or is that ultimately where they're going? Well, that's where they say they're going. They've they've, how do they do that? They've been a plan. What's that? How do they do that? Well, so they have a plan that's called the low carbon development strategy. And so what they want to do is use much of the oil revenue to build one infrastructure to kind of protect against climate change. And that would include things like reinforcing the seawall. There's a seawall right now that runs along 280 miles of coastline. And that that needs to be reinforced and expanded because the Caribbean is projected to rise, you know, up to six feet by the end century of if things stay on course as they are. So part of the money would go to infrastructure like that. Part of it would go to building building basically a new energy grid that would be a post oil energy grid. So the leaders say that they want to use this money, basically use oil money to finance the transition away from one. And it sounds paradoxical and it you know, it sounds, you know, on first blush I guess like something that goes against most, you know, kind of environmental thinking like to embrace oil production. You know, this comes. Yeah, it comes years after the developed countries of the world have promised a wean themselves off of the way. But Guyana will will make the arguments that it's not fair to a developing country to not be able to have some of the benefits from the oil industry when the developed world has benefited from industrialization and the benefits of fossil fuels. And contributed the line share climate change, which countries like Guyana, right stuck with the built to kind of pay for. Well, I have to say so much in this story. It's a really great deep read. I'm thinking even far this weekend or the upcoming holiday weekend, and really worth getting into. And this is the quandary that you find many developing nations. And thank you so much.

18019," Welcome back! Come down to the clothes. Bloomberg's comprehensive cross-platform coverage ahead of the US market clothes starts right now. And right now we are counting you down to the closing bell for about 60 minutes to go here to the end of the trading session. End of the trading week, Scarlett. Romain Bostic here alongside Scarlett Foule. We're joined right now by one of our favorite colleagues, Tim Stenevick as well as Carol Master. We welcome our audience across Blueberg Television Radio as well as on YouTube. I like Carol too. Carol is my favorite. She knows that. Speaking is someone speaking. It's an interesting kind of day and I thought because it's kind of milling when I feel like as we get it ready for the weekend and maybe the holiday week next week. I wanted to look at the names that have really outperformed this week in the S&P 500. And it's a bunch of the retailers. In fact, raw stores remain you've talked about this one in a big way. This stock is up almost 11% for the week overall and that's coming off if it's earnings and some of the results in terms of working down its inventory. You've got Cisco earnings this week and upbeat and raising its outlook. That stock is up about 6.5%. But Derna was up about 7% again, one of the top performers this week and then TJ Maxx also coming out hitting in fact another record today and that was up about 6%. I just think it's telling. Right that what? Well, I was going to say that's great. But as far as the broader market picture wouldn't it be better if we saw an apple and a Tesla and a Microsoft up there? Is this leadership on the market? I'm not looking to be better. I'm just trying to say that here we are coming off of it's still earnings that drives stock movements here as we try to make sense of what the Fed's going to do ultimately we can't really figure out the big macro story. Yeah, I guess I would like to see Apple charge in ahead but you're seeing really investors react to the story of the day are really reacting to fundamentals if you will. I just wanted to copy Carol and do the opposite of what she did. So I'm looking at four of the top two.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,633,2022-11-18 20:03:07
18020," react to the story of the day are really reacting to fundamentals, if you will. I just wanted to copy Carol and do the opposite of what she did. So I'm looking at four of the top decliners in the S&P 500 for the week. I talked about advanced auto parts earlier this week. So it's biggest drop in more than two years after reporting results that underwhelmed investors. We had to charge off from a capital one earlier this week as well that led to a downgrade from Bank of America finishing the week. Well, I don't want to say finishing the week, but rounding out the week at about 15% lower, car max down more than 11%. And live nation is really the one I wanted to talk about. All you swifties out there much of the week's move today comes from today because the parent company of ticket master and the New York Times reporting earlier today that the DOJ's opened an investigation and antitrust investigation into the company. Wow. Wouldn't it be wild if Taylor Swift was the one who brought an eye trust enforcement to the United States finally? Well, I had his powers. She does look what she did was streaming. Yeah, exactly. But it's different. David Weston talked about the Sunnis program earlier. It's the stadiums. Who is a swifty, by the way? Who's not? Who is not a swifty, Carol? That is the real one. Cannot a swifty get off the chair right now. All right. Well, we're going to continue going on. If you're not a swifty, keep watching. Please, the major indices right now, not doing a whole lot. Basically, either down or roughly about two to three tenths of a percent or up about two to three tenths of a percent. The S&P up to 10th to Dow up for 10th to Nasdaq composite lower on the day, but you put it all together across the board. They're all lower, guys, on a weekly basis. And it's really a mixed picture when you look at the industry groups. Utilities are doing the best up about 1.9 percent. Most of the gainers, most of the members, they are up except for one name. In healthcare, you've got Elevants, which is a company formerly known as Anthem leading the way there and energy leading the way down. I was just taking a look at volume. And with one hour to go in trading, volume is about 44 percent below the year-to-day average. A lot of stuff can happen in this final hour. Yeah, we'll keep an eye on that here as far as some of the individual movers. You get a few bright spots out there. You're going to find that in general. Motors shares up to 1.5 percent. You were just talking about the retailers, Carol. I was keeping an eye on William Sonoma, which I thought would perform a little bit better. We did get those earnings down about 6 percent here right now. And Coinbase getting an interesting downgrade today. A lot of concerns here about the ripple effects from FTX into Coinbase, not necessarily in terms of financial exposure, but more in terms of the crisis of confidence. And that's what the low share is down to 7 percent. And at the bottom of your screen, guess what? We actually have a new addition. Grinder. It's coming to the market. Yeah, up to 111 percent right now. At least based off that, 36, 28, something to keep an eye on. This of course came to the market through a spack deal. But nevertheless, maybe it shows that there is some optimism for new issues. Before we move on, I do want to circle back to what Scarlet was just saying. And you can put up my next term here because, yeah, I was looking at volume is incredibly light right now here. But this is an option expiration day here, the monthly op-X. And there's been a lot of volatility around this. They're proceeded. In fact, Wednesday, excuse me, we actually saw actually the biggest jump, the biggest activity in single stocks here, that CBOE put call ratio on Wednesday. Actually hit its highest level going back to 1997 here. So I think a lot of people were trying to front run the expiration that we're getting today here. But keep an eye on this space over the next 50 minutes or so here because we could see volume pick back up. And when there's options activity on individual names, is it on all the meme stocks or is it on boring stocks? It's on any. Whatever you want. It's on any stock. It can do it on anything. Yeah. Hey, speaking of doing anything, it does feel like that's what Wall Street economists are thinking about when it comes to Fed policy in 2023. Right now, there's split on whether the Fed will actually cut rates next year. So that is out there. It's among our most red stories on the Bloomberg. One thing I do feel like there is a consensus whether it's a hawkish or dovish Fed member. We're pretty consistent on kind of this message of it's all about getting inflation down and add to that list Fed Reserve, Bank of President Susan Collins. She made some comments at a Fed event in Boston today. Here's what she had to say. There is more work to be done. I expect that this will require additional increases in the federal funds rate followed by a period of holding rates at a sufficiently restrictive level for some time. The latest data have not reduced my sense of what's sufficiently restrictive may mean or my resolve to bring inflation down. And guys, I love that last line. Restrictive stance will be needed for some time, which, as we know, and that's Susan Collins from the Boston Fed President there, it leaves a lot of room for interpretation and the Fed is really good about doing that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,634,2022-11-18 20:07:16
18021," will be needed for some time, which, as we know, and that's just in Collins from the Boston Fed president there, it leaves a lot of room for interpretation and the Fed is really good about doing that remain. Absolutely, though I will say that we seem to be hearing this from multiple Fed members. That's phrase or some turn of that phrase of basically keeping things restrictive and it gets to this idea of a pivot because as everyone out all our guests remind us, a pivot means the Fed is going to start cutting rates and there seems to be a consensus here, at least from the members that have spoken publicly that that's not going to happen. When they get to that terminal rate, they plan to hang out there for a little while. It's a sort of pivot. Is it kind of a repeat of what we saw over the summer where the market gets a little ahead of itself, rallying, scarlet, and then Fed officials have to come out and say, wait a second, this is not really what we're going for. I mean, I think back to Neil Cache, Cari's comments on the Adlots podcast over the summer that helps squash a rally. Yeah, it's all about managing expectations and you're right. What was the turn of phrase restrictive policy for longer? Suppressively restrictive. Re-special restrictive. I mean, that sounds really bloggered over, but does that really just mean we're going to pause for a while? She was definitely reading from something. That was a very specific turn of phrase, right? A lot of lawyers had to look that one over. That's what the market is going to have to contend with here. I mean, we were talking to Cheetah Martin, Adam's on Bloomberg Television a little while ago and she was talking about valuations in the context of where interest rates are. If we're getting up to a 5% terminal rate or above and then they plan to hang out there for months, maybe even longer than that, what does that mean for a revaluation of the market? Well, don't ask Wall Street economists because right now they're split about what's going to happen in 2023 when it comes to cuts. All right, guys, we're going to be back in less than an hour's time. Our cross-platform coverage on the markets, on radio, TV, YouTube, and on Bloomberg Quick Take is going to continue. We're going to cut you down to the close with Beyond the Bell at 4pm Wall Street Time. This is Bloomberg Business Week with Carol Maser and Bloomberg Quick Takes Tim Stenevick on Bloomberg Radio. Hi, everybody. You are listening and watching Bloomberg Business Week on TGIF. Yes, it is Friday. What's interesting and we've noticed this, I feel like in the last couple of days, once again, we're seeing what do we have about less than an hour's to go until the closing bell. We're seeing some buying once again here in this last hour. Finally seeing some direction. I don't know if I, you know, I- Is that too strong of a word to use? You know, we've been up and down today. So, some volatility continues, even as the VIX continues to go down on us to full point, we're at 23 in change here. But I do always find it interesting heading into a weekend, heading into a holiday week that if we start to continue to see some buying into the close, I always find that. You know, that's a sign of strength, I think. Yeah, I think that's a really good point. I want to lay out pretty fast. I want to lay out pretty fast. Yeah, I think that's a really good point. I want to lay out pretty fast. I want to lay out pretty fast. Scarlett said she referred to low volume and she used the, you know, compared to what we've seen this year. I'm looking at 20 day volumes, down 25% about, you know, in terms of volume today versus the average over the last 20 days. And leads me to ask if people are on vacation already at this point. Or if they're just waiting for other eco data, if they are too split. I think it's often you see a holiday week, people either heading out early, they're going away, they're maybe taking off, you know, more than a week or so. It does that for Thanksgiving, that sounds really nice. Where are you going? Yeah, I'm going to Cincinnati, but I'm going for four days. I'm anchor. It's the most expensive plane tickets I've ever bought in my life. I know I've complained about that a lot. Sorry, son, there will be no college education. Exactly. We went to Cincinnati once, so you will not be going to college. All right, everybody, quick check on the markets as we set a little bit of a uptick in the S&P, but it's just up about one third of 1%. Dow Jones industrial average at Gainev just under a half a percent, up 153 points. Now it's like still to the downside, but Tim, it's down just 14 points or down one tenth of 1%. All right, markets open for another hour or so, or 50 minutes, I should say. In the meantime, let's go to Denise Pelagreeni, she's standing by right now in our newsroom. Hey, Denise. Hey there, Tim. Thank you. The Justice Department is appointing prosecutor Jack Smith to oversee criminal investigations related to former President Trump and the January 6th insurrection and also a possession of classified documents after he was President. H.E. Marick Garland says it's about the timing. Based on recent developments, including the former President's announcement that he is a candidate for President in the next election and the sitting President stated intention to be a candidate as well, I have concluded that it is in the public interest to appoint a special counsel. H.E. Marick Garland there and Bloomberg's Joe Matthew tells us there's a sense cases against the former President Trump are building now.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,635,2022-11-18 20:11:37
18022," to appoint a special council. A. G. Merrick Garland there and Bloomberg's Joe Matthew tells us there's a sense cases against the former president Trump are building now. January 6th really changed the picture. I think in the document investigation at Mar-a-Lago changed the picture. They know they have goods. It's been suggested that they believe they have enough to indict now. When you add the investigation into the mob at the Capitol, they have an enormous amount of evidence to pour through. When Joe Matthew there host of Bloomberg's own none and some key leadership positions in the House of Representatives mean time are likely to see a shake up. We get more than that from Bloomberg's Amy Morris. We already know Democrats will see changes as Nancy Pelosi steps down, but Republicans are also debating whether to keep subcommittee leaders in certain positions. Several top Republican appropriators are term limited, but they could get waivers to keep serving in the same positions. However, if they did step down, that could create openings for others to seek promotions. They don't see the point in changing assignments just for the sake of change, but that they will defer to Republican leader Kevin McCarthy. In Washington, I'm Amy Morris, Bloomberg Radio. All right. Thank you, Amy, and Global News. 24 hours a day. On air and on Bloomberg Quick Take. I'm Denise Pellegrini. This is Bloomberg. All right, Denise. Thank you so much. Denise Pellegrini with World of National News there, Bloomberg News. This story actually jumped out at us by our Martin Paris. It's on the Bloomberg and at Bloomberg.com. Banksy, you know the artist. Nobody really knows who this person is, right? Art just kind of pops up. It's very cool. I know who. I don't really know. I was just saying that. That was pretty good. I thank you. It's almost for us. I was going to try to make like a situation, not to produce a big glass. Did you hear our producer's big goal? I could hear you fall. We have soundproof glass up here, but sometimes you know when we do something. His laugh. He just penetrates. It's always the laugh that we hear. It's never when he's frustrated with us. No, we never hear when he's frustrated. That doesn't penetrate. Well, Banksy has accused clothing retailer, gas of stealing his iconic flower, thrower, motif for a store displays on Regenstreet London and has urged his 11 and a half million Instagram followers to shoplift from the store. First of all, please don't shoplift. Over the years, the artist has trademark registration challenge due to impart his desire to conceal his identity. Initially, the European Union intellectual property office ruled that this and his anonimity prevented his ability to trademark various images. But on November 16th, the European Union at Board of Appeals overruled that decision, according to our news, meaning he now has the ability to seek intellectual property protection for images like flower, thrower. All right. And as our reporting goes, it's unclear whether guests has licensed the rights to use the artist's image and it's clothing line. No mention of brand-alized or Banksy can be found on the guest website, but a guest ex-brand-alized press release issued by a Belgian marketing agency that represents its works for guest shows a fall-winter 2022 capsule collection featuring casual apparel inspired by Banksy's graffiti. Do you remember back in 2018 that Banksy love is in the bin, was shredded live during the hour? Oh, yes, yes. How cool was that? Yes, it was wild. It was absolutely wild. Wicked money. For even after the fact it was shredded. Right. Right. And like in real time, you can hear the gasps from the crowd as they just watched this, you know, work of art worth so much money being shredded. It can be. Art can be a wacky world. Yeah, can.

18024," business flash. All right, next half hour, Charlie, first of all, thank you. Next half hour, it's really all about crypto, kind of perfect, considering the last couple of weeks in the collapse of FTX and the undoing, if you will, of SBF and his empire. And in our weekly crypto segment, we've got an entrepreneur entrenched in the crypto world. Yeah, we're talking to Alexander Dreyfus, the founder and CEO of its global blockchain company. It's called Chili's. And then also the CEO of the sports app, socios.com. Alexander joins us via Zoom from Malta this afternoon. Alexander, good to have you with us. First of all, Malta. Why are you in Malta? Very much for the invitation. I've been in Malta for 16 years, even though you probably guessed that I have a French accent. And I've been there just because I was working in the online gaming industry for 15 years before crypto. So that was the place where I moved. And I'm happy to be here. Well, tell us a little bit about your companies, because from what I understand, as Tim mentioned, your founder and CEO of the global blockchain company, Chili's. And I hope we're saying it correctly. Are we? Actually, you do it perfectly. Okay. We were a little worried. We did practice a lot, Carol. You've done it. And then you've got your CEO of socios.com and socios is powered by Chili's or Chili's. So help me out and forgive me because the past two weeks and FTX and SBF, we are realizing that there's not always so much transparency when it comes to things in the crypto world. So explain if you would the relationships of Soutino's two companies that you are CEO, both CEO of. Yes, it's pretty easy. So first of all, we are a blockchain. Chili's is a blockchain, number 30s today, I think in the rankings. And what we provide is an infrastructure for the sports industry to create a concept that we invented called phantom tokens. And these phantom tokens are used on a consumer app called socios.com, which has like 1.8 million users, something like that. And our business is to try to help sports property all over the world to engage and monetize their fan base. And the idea is that a fan can buy a phantom token that gives them the right to vote on some decision of the club and get some membership benefits provided by the team or provided by us. That's how it started. And so we have four and a half years ago and now we work with 170 teams all over the world, 300 employees, etc. And how many have you sold? Oh, a lot. We have 70 teams launched, I will say, and it generated a few hundred millions of dollars for the last two years, actually. Why Alexander does it have to be on the blockchain? Why can't teams do this without blockchain technology? I love that question. So the reality is that 99% of sports fans are not in a stadium, not in a city, not even in the country, of the team they are supporting. So we were looking to create something that was both valuable for a fan and scalable for a team. And what is valuable for a fan is to have a voice, to be recognized. So the fact that you can vote on the blockchain, unlike the SMS that you send on a TV show, a Saturday night, where you have absolutely zero transparency about who's going to be voted out on a TV show, here the voting of you deciding as a fan, something related to your team is on the blockchain. And that's what's actually the foundation of what we've done. So these fan tokens that you've said you've sold and generated a few hundred million dollars, I guess, in revenue I'm assuming? Yes, in revenue. Those fan coins can maybe be bought back by fans. Yes, because they're on the blockchain, because they're digital assets, they are tradable. And therefore they are available to the market, more or less anywhere in the world. So and in terms of, and again, forgive me because we're dealing with the backdrop of the last two weeks. So those coins, do you keep 50% of the, like do you leverage them? Do you do something with those coins? I'm just curious, if all of a sudden everybody that has fan coins came in and said I want to buy them back, could you do it? No, you cannot redeem them. It's like a membership program. Once you buy it, it's yours if you want to sell it to someone else you can. See that a little bit as a collectible. There is nothing that is, it's not redeemable, there is no collateral, it's just a digital membership that has scarcity where fans can train it against each other, if they want. And so how many members do you have? 1.8 million. 1.8 million, okay. Hey, Alexander, again, with the context of everything that's happened last two weeks.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,638,2022-11-18 20:24:38
18025," against each other if they want. And so how many members do you have? 1.8 million. 1.8 million. OK. Hey, Alexander, again, with the context of everything that's happened the last two weeks, I mean, this has certainly been a momentous time when it comes to Web 3, when it comes to everything that's even tertiary related to crypto. I'm just wondering what that does to your business, the way that you're watching this news unfold from FTX, from Binance, and the like. Does it damage the reputation of the industry and to the extent that it hits you? It's disappointing for me as an entrepreneur, because I met some actually a billion Bahamas, so I know them very well. I like to say to our colleagues, it doesn't impact us, but it affects us. It doesn't impact us as a business, because we have no relationship. We had zero exposure. But it affects us, obviously, as an industry. Because of course, we are in a crypto space. Having said so, we are not in a business of lending money. We're in a sports space. Bitcoin could go to zero tomorrow morning. We will still have a business. And that's a big difference. And what I think is going to realize in the next six months to one year is blockchain slash crypto is not just about finance. There are other utility or the application. Right. And hopefully one of us is this. Hey, Alexander, just got about 30 seconds. Have you talked to SPF? Sit down. No, definitely not. Definitely not. Are you a little angry, though, as someone who's also kind of in this world to see what has happened just quickly? I'm frustrated and disappointed because it damaged an industry that didn't need it that. All right. We're going to leave it there. Look forward to hearing more about your business going forward. Alexander Dreyfus, founder and CEO of the Global Blockchain Company, Chilez. He's also CEO of the blockchain platform for fan engagement and fan monetization of sports team at socios.com. Socios, as we mentioned, is powered by Chilez just so that we understand that relationship. And Alexander joining us via Zoom in Malta. You are listening and watching Bloomberg Business.

All right Charlie thank you so much as we mentioned our most red or among our most red on the Bloomberg terminal right now is the U.S. Justice Department appointing an independent special counsel to oversee criminal investigations related to former president Donald Trump and to decide whether to bring any charges now that he is making a third run for the White House in 2024. We've got a Bloomberg news US legal reporter Eric Larson joining us now is the perfect guy to break down what we need to know about this and also explain the process here. So Eric what is the special counsel going to do when it comes to the investigation what is the process here. So right now this special counsel's responsibility is going to be to take over the existing investigation into Trump's handling of White House records of course related to the search of Mar-a-Lago and also the January 6th insurrection in any role that Trump and others had in that attack on the Capitol he's going to be overseeing all of these investigations and making any decision on charging. So it's a huge responsibility and it was kind of unexpected I don't think anyone was quite sure this was going to happen but here we are. Do we have any idea of like a timeline of how this plays out. You know we really don't they use the word expeditiously a lot during this attorney general Merrick Garland had a meeting earlier issued a statement and they said that this is not going to slow down the investigation. It's it's hard to know for sure if that's accurate or not. I mean I've spoken with some former federal prosecutor types who said that appointing a special counsel will definitely slow things down just because you have to get all these investigators up to speed higher staff get an office for this independent role. So we'll see but they seem to be making a concerted effort to tell us that it's not going to slow down. I could see a critic of a move like this saying okay when is it going to stop. You know if they see this as politically charged they would say Democrats have impeached the president twice. They have convened a January 6th panel. Nothing has essentially stuck to him to the extent that many people want to see. How should that be read in the context of the move from Garland today in terms of sort of seriousness of what's going on. Well I would say that there's still a major legal threat including criminal potential criminal charges facing Trump and that's kind of separate from what he's already dealt with already in terms of the January 6th committee of course that had nothing to do with the DOJ investigation and that was very public. What the DOJ is doing behind the scenes here is all very private secret we don't know what their deliberations are like. So as far as it you know which hunt that you know we all saw what happened on January 6th and we all know what was seized from from Trump's home at Mar-a-Lago. So I mean these are legitimate criminal investigations that need to be resolved and now that he's announced he's running for office this appointment of a special counsel is supposed to give.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,641,2022-11-18 20:37:37
18028," Ago, so I mean these are legitimate criminal investigations that need to be resolved. And now that he's announced he's running for office, this appointment of a special council is supposed to give an impression of independence and from someone who's not necessarily connected directly to the Biden administration who will make the decision, so that it will seem less political when that decision is made. Help me out though, if I'm general public, I am part of the general public. The attorney, US Attorney General, Merrick Garland, was appointed by President Biden. Yeah. Runs the Justice Department. So does this appointment, was it encouraged possibly by the White House or how does that work? Well we can tell you that a source in the White House did tell one of my colleagues that the White House did not get any heads up on the decision to appoint a special council that Merrick Garland would have made this decision without consulting at all with the Biden and with the White House because they wanted to make this an independent decision. Of course the special council is ultimately answers to the DOJ and Merrick Garland ultimately answers to Biden. So it's not that there's a complete division here, but this is as good as you can get when you are someone who's under criminal investigation and you've decided to run for President. And do you be fair President Trump has done the same thing when he was in the White House? Well he didn't appoint Robert Mueller, the Justice for the Attorney General appointed Robert Mueller, a special council, but that did, again that does show that there is some independence from the DOJ from the White House, being able to appoint a special council into a sitting president and here we have one appointing a special council into a former president, the same person. So again it's all about this feeling of independence, but as we saw with Robert Mueller, even though he was a Republican and was known for playing by the books, he was immediately attacked by Trump and all of his supporters anyway so that independence and that lack of bias didn't really get him much in the end. What do we know about John L. Jack Smith? You know I had never heard of him before just recently, but we know now that he was a former federal prosecutor in Tennessee. He led a division in the Justice Department of Public Integrity Unit and more recently he's been a war crime prosecutor in the Hague, related to war crimes in Kosovo, which you know that is still ongoing. So he's got quite an interesting career actually. Oh it's going to say in terms of timing here, how long does something like this take, like what should we expect? Well that's a big question. Some of the people that I've spoken with in terms of timing, they've said that they would really have to make a decision on charging by spring because how else would you have a whole criminal trial potentially having before an election, before the primaries? So you would need like at least a year, maybe for a case, this is what they've told me, but if you don't want to have someone on a ballot for a primary who is under criminal investigation or going to trial, then you need to wrap that up before then, which would mean making a decision fairly soon in the spring I was told. Special if it means questioning also the former president. Right, right, right. It's tricky. Thank you so much. Made some sense out of those headlines today. Bloomberg News, US Legal Reporter Eric Larson in our studio. And to do the spell of greenie we go for an update on world and national news, she's in the Bloomberg News from Hey Denise. Yeah, as you were just talking about Attorney General Merrick Garland appointing a special counsel to oversee investigations in the Justice Department, this will involve former president Trump's his transfer of power up to and including January six were told and also the investigation into the presence of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate. Now, Garland says Jack Smith is really going to hit the ground running here. Mr Smith will begin his work as special counsel immediately and will be returning to the United States from the Hague rushing home from the Hague. He says and Garland says Smith has been serving as a prosecutor. As you just mentioned for the special court in the Hague, so he is considered a heavy hitter. President Biden says global leaders want to stick together to help the global economy along. There's a strong sense from all the leaders of the world of the strength of the American economy and we've seen the willingness to want to work together and also here at home.

That crypto-denominated assets warrant skepticism, for example. That market capitalization isn't the same as value, and that accounting and consumer protections really do matter. Whatever the potential benefits of crypto, the surrounding speculative friends has little to do with them. On the contrary, it is mostly served to separate people from their money as FTX has shown.

So as Charlie mentioned, not at our highs, although it looks like the down the S&P getting close, S&P though, up 7 tens of a percent. Same story for the Dow Jones industrial average and the NAS, just eating out a little bit of a game. And it's going to be, yeah, for the week, Carol, the Dow up more than 1 tenth of 1 percent if it's different here. So just barely, barely, barely. Let's get into it there and Ken and co-founder and CEO of Clear Harbor asset. Management, they've got over a billion dollars in assets under management. Aaron joins us this afternoon once again from Stanford, Connecticut. You can see him if you're watching on Quick Take or on YouTube. Aaron, good to have you with us this afternoon. How are you? Going just great, Tim. Thanks for having me back. So what's going on with the markets right now? Because Carol mentioned volatility today. Throughout much of the day, we suspect moving between gains and losses. But we're seeing a little bit of conviction right now. What's your take? Yeah, I mean, clearly we don't take much away from a low valve volume day ahead of Thanksgiving on a Friday. But if you look at just sort of on a quarter to date basis, just taking a slightly higher level view, clearly, we've seen the dollar finally depreciate, about 7 percent from the peak from late September. And on the heels of that, we saw a nice, wrist-on trade occur over that period. So equities are up 10, 11, 12 percent depending on the index. The global indices are up about 11, almost 12 percent. US S&P's up a little over 10 percent over that period. And even the bond markets caught a reasonable bid, the broad sort of Bloomberg aggregate, up 1.1 percent. So we think that's sort of augurs reasonably well. The Fed did a lot of job owning this week. Tim and Carol, as you saw, you know, trying to keep... Did you even try to keep track of all that job owning? Yeah, that's right. I mean, trying to keep the sort of hawkish tone embedded in the market. But, you know, the market's currently pricing in another 100 basis points. They've already done 400. And so we're in the latter innings of a tightening cycle. And we're starting to see, in simpient levels of deceleration on inflation. And so, you know, I think that bodes well for, you know, the Fed to get out of our way for at least a back half of 2023. I do feel the narrative has definitely changed from Fed officials, Aaron, even if they're not using the word pivot. They're kind of talking around it. And I laugh that when we've got a most red story by our Scott, excuse me, by our Steve Matthews and Serena Yu, where it's talking about Wall Street economist Splitt on whether Fed cuts rates in 2023 that we're starting to think about a Fed cut next year as a possibility. That to me is a real big shift in the narrative. Yeah, I agree, Carol. And I think there's also, you know, an anticipation that the Fed's policies do, in fact, work with that lag. Right. And we're going to start to see employment. We're certainly seeing the anecdotal evidence of employment, employment softening that the jolt's data has at least softened on the margin. And so maybe the Fed does move that aggregate demand curve to such a degree after, let's say hitting that 5% terminal rate.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,645,2022-11-18 20:54:58
18032," often on the margin. And so maybe the Fed does move the aggregate demand curve to such a degree after, let's say, hitting that 5% terminal rate that we start to see the economic deceleration that they anticipated. And I suspect over the next two quarters, we'll see a reasonably significant change in the data set. And that'll set up for an interesting 2023. But then we have earnings to really think about. We have the gridlock in Congress. We don't have that fiscal stimulus that we had over the last couple of years to serve that tailwind for growth. And we have a demographic picture that every year just looks a little worse. And then we have debt levels that spiked during COVID and are not getting much better. And so we're probably have a debt load in this country of three and a half times. Public debt load, three and a half times where we were last time we had an inflation crisis in the 70s. So it doesn't bode well for growth trending back or above trends. Above, let's say, a 2% trend. It seems to suggest that we're going to be in a below 2% world for a long while here in the US. You know, Conglad, you went there, Aaron. I do think it's important that we watch the debt loads overall. And certainly, we talk a lot about specifically consumer spending and how they're spending and where they putting it. And I think that's going to be a great indicator possibly to the downside of what happens in 2023. You did say, and I want to go back to you expect over the next two quarters to see a very different data set. Well, that data set, I'm assuming, mean recession, or not necessarily, or just kind of an extreme slowing down. Well, I think the market is trying to sort that out. As we know, the equity markets at discounting instrument and certainly the volatility that we've seen of late is sort of this uncertainty around one, will we actually enter a true recession? Maybe we already did. The NBER hasn't come out and indicated whether the prior two quarters were, in fact, an official recession. We'll find that out next year, I guess. But I think that maybe the more important question is whether or not the recession is shallow or deep. But if it's shallow, I think a great deal of that is sort of was priced in at the end of September into the market. One reason why I've seen the rally. It's a deeper recession. Well, this may be a sort of a false dawn for equities, having rallied nicely off of those levels. And so we're certainly being extraordinarily mindful of that. Certainly, the stickiness factor in the CPI is wages. And with higher wages, you tend to see margins contract. And so we're certainly going to keep vigilance on that trend going into 2023. What do margins do in a slower growth world when wages haven't corrected and normalized? And certainly an important factor. Then of course, globally, we have another pivot, which is the zero COVID policy in China. And whether or not President Xi's pivot is real or not. Because that has huge repercussions for global demand, demand for copper, demand for oil, and demand for just generally goods and services. Well, that commodity space that we talked about that earlier. And I think it's going back to China too. So interesting, we have a ton of stories on the Bloomberg this week that even as they seem to be easing that COVID-0 thinking, people are afraid to go out in the public, because they're just afraid they're going to get COVID. And this is over in China. And that's going to impact growth over in the Chinese economy for a while. It'll impact growth, but it's also as huge global repercussions. I mean, Chinese growth is expected to be around 3% next year. It was only a few years ago. We were talking 7, 8, 9, 10% type of growth. The idea that they could switch off the zero COVID switch probably increases oil demand immediately by about a million and a half barrels a day by most estimates. So it has huge global repercussions. And of course, the war in Ukraine is having massive negative repercussions for the price of natural gas in Europe's largest economy in Germany. I mean, that's the largest economy in Europe. They need cheap natural gas to be able to do what they do to beat that industrial powerhouse. And they don't have it. And it looks like they won't have it next year either. And maybe the year after that too. All right. Well, I monopolized the time with you. Tim's mad at me, but that's because we love talking with you. Aaron, we're going to get you back on soon, because come on, Carol. It's OK. You had good questions, Carol. Yeah. Aaron, have a great, great Thanksgiving. He's got founder, CEO, Clear Harbor Asset Management. Time to head over to our TV colleagues.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,646,2022-11-18 20:59:19
18033," Carol, it's okay. You had good questions, Carol. We, you know, Aaron have a great, great Thanksgiving. He's got founder, CEO, Clear Harbor asset management time to head over to our TV colleagues, our cross-platform coverage on radio, TV, and YouTube. We're counting it out of the clothes. Beyond the Bell, Bloomberg's comprehensive cross-platform coverage of the U.S. market clothes, darn it right now. And right now, we are two minutes away from the end of the trading day, Romain Bostic, and Scarlet Food, when we're counting it down to the clothing bell and here to help take us beyond the bell. It's our global s-simalcast. I'm pleased to say we are joined by Carol, Master, and Tim Stenevich. We welcome our audiences across Bloomberg Television, radio, as well as on YouTube, and Quick Take Carol. Interesting week here, not necessarily in terms of the magnitude of the moves, but certainly a lot of repositioning. Yeah, absolutely. Good way to say it, and a lot of kind of movement all around the place, as we move to that repositioning, if you will, even on in today's trade, we just talk with Aaron Kenan over at Clear Harbor Asset Management. And he's really watching the next couple of months and the next couple of quarters when it comes to data sets. And he says, we're going to see a very different data set, not sure if it's going to clearly say we are in a recession or whether or not it's just an extreme slowdown. So, TBD, but nonetheless, that's what he's keeping his eye on. Yeah, he said, make sure not to, you know, pay too much attention to a day like today, where we got low volume Scarlet. It's the Friday before a holiday week. So don't read into it too much. But building off of what Carol just said, in addition to what happens with, you know, N-B-E-R data or data that could indicate whether or not we're in a recession, look at what happens in China over the next few months, whether there is some sort of relaxation of COVID-0. That's really important to keep an eye on. Yeah, and I'm looking at volume since you're saying don't read too much into what's been going on. And we are well below the three month average. 24% below the three month average right now when it comes to volume. And there's still a minute to go. So we're definitely not going to make up the difference here. You wonder if this is going to be the template for the next week and maybe the week after that as well because everyone's waiting for the next data point. Yeah, when you look all across the state tapes here in the US, I mean, we're right now about 16% below 24% on the S&P 5 venture. And keep in mind, of course, the week of Thanksgiving is a traditionally low volume week. In fact, the Friday after Thanksgiving, typically the second lowest volume day of the year. You hear the people cheering, you hear the people clapping, you hear your closing bell numbers coming out in New York. The Dow Jones industrial average higher by six cents of a percent. The S&P 500 higher by five tenths of a percent. The NASDAQ composite only higher by one tenth of one tenth of a percent. And the Russell 2000, I think I got that right. And the Russell 2000 going to finish the day higher by about six tenths of a percent. I mean, call it close there. If I look at the S&P 500, a little bit of a deeper dive into it, we're going to get into the industry groups in just a moment. But more the names in the S&P are higher today. 388 to be exact scarlet. 115 to the downside. So a little bit, if you could say maybe even more than a little bit of a risk on trade when it comes to the S&P 500. Is it a risk on trade? I look at utilities and they're the best performers in the S&P 500 on the day up by better than 2% with all 30 members higher healthcare equipment and services also doing well. So you've got two groups that are up at least 2% right now. A bit of a stealth increase at the end of trading. But again, as to mention, we can't read too much into it given the low volumes, given the options expiration. There might be a lot of back and forth, a lot of repositioning, closing out positions, setting up new positions, going on underneath the sector groups. Energy, the big losers on the day down nine tenths of 1%. I'm just going to say scarlet. There's more green than red there. This is true. All right, let's get to some of the individual gainers in today's session. Woa, Ross Stores was up 18% at its highs today, finishing the day with just under a 10% gain. It was the number one gainer in the S&P 500 top of the Nasdaq 100 as well. Soaring the most, I think about two years, they boosted their full-year profit forecast, Alice saying the Off-Price Retailers report significantly better than expected. They did, though, note that macro market uncertainty, macro uncertainty continues to negatively impact consumer sentiment and demands. So just putting that out there, but nonetheless, investors rushing in big time. Another retailer, the GAP, also out performance, up 7.5% in today's session, rallying today. It was up almost 11% at its highs, though. It posted third quarter sales and profit at beat estimates that were out there. You had a lot of analysts also hiking their price targets on that name. And then, remaining mentioned this.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,647,2022-11-18 21:03:36
18034," but it's highs though. It posted third quarter sales and profit that beat estimates that were out there. You had a lot of analysts also hiking their price targets on that name. And then, Remain you mentioned this, I thought this was just kind of a cool one to mention. Grindr up 514% at its highs, up 213% by the close here, of course, the online dating app for the LGBTQ plus community when public via SPAC that happened last night. And it's interesting, I mean, obviously a lot of people always make a joke here about Grindr, but we talk about risk appetite in this market and the fact that we haven't seen too many new issues come to market, whether it's through IPOs and certainly not through the more speculative view of SPAC. So, $1.2 billion market? Yeah, this is a big deal. Yeah. Big deal. All right, you got the gainers, Carol. I'm going to dig into the Kleiner's Tesla. Once again, weighing on the S&P 500, shares down 1.6% today, but it's the longer term that I'm interested in. Shares down 20% since that deal for Twitter closed for Elon Musk, because he continues to try to rest control of the company. We talked to Kurt Wagner earlier about the troubles that he's facing with getting employees to actually work on the product there, a little earlier in our program today. Carvana finished today down by more than 3%. The company said it will eliminate 1,500 jobs, which amounts to roughly 8% of the workforce. Carvana is down by 98% from its all-time highs. I don't understand that. Are they still selling cars? I mean, it's a big white bow. The concern is that there's this slowdown in the used car market, but it's got to be bigger than that. It's wiped out almost 98% of its value. It's pretty wild to see that. And then got to end with Live Nation, finishing it down by close to 8%. Today, Taylor Swift did make her first public comments on the bungled pre-sale. She didn't mention ticket master. Live Nation is, of course, the parent company of it. She said that it was excruciating to watch mistakes happen with no- She said bad blood, right? She didn't say that. She did not. If it's a tricky, Taylor moved the market then. Did Taylor Swift remove the market? No, it was the New York Times report about the DOJ investigation into ticket master. Oh, it's okay. So in other words, Taylor moved the market. Taylor, look, we're all Swifties now. And I just want to go to yields, but just real quick, I do want to point out, Carbana, acting down 32% of a week, that's the worst performer in the Russell 1000 on this year. We're going to talk about that later too. Now, are we? Yeah, good. I'm going to talk about the bonds. OK, I got to start coming to these meetings. Let's take a look here at what's going on in the yield space because it was an interesting move here. The two year yield started to float back higher as a lot of people now starting to reassess that Fed pivot, that Fed never said they were going to pivot. But seven basis points here on the day and 19 basis points on a weekly basis. What I think is interesting, though, Scarlett, is that big move in the two year, nothing in the 10 year, 3.8195, that's basically where we were last Friday. Similar story on the 20, similar story on the 30. So most of that move now coming at the short end of the curve. And that means deeper inversion that we're seeing on that Tuesday's 10s and some of the other key metrics here, is something to keep an eye on. The big question is, what is the bond market pricing and is it just the Fed rates or is it something more when it comes to recession in the economy? Why are we so obsessed with pivot? Why not just pause? Why don't we take it one step at a time? I don't know. You know what they parse? Do you think they just have a fissaurus that they put out on the table? They are at the apples building and they just flip through it and try and figure out that most of it is. But they never said to this, right? The transitory is crost off now. Soft landing is crost off. They're not like you guys. Pivot is like a big circle with an X-3Wat. No way. Pivot, we shouldn't even be talking about a pivot. We have no idea how long we're going to be creating. But that's basically what they've given us over the, for a while, I feel like they've been kind of spoon feeding it to us. Speaking of all of this, guys, I mean, just kind of push ahead next week. We do get Fed Minnes, believe it or not, on Wednesday. So we'll get maybe a little more insight. I don't know. But you never know what you've said, Minnes. Sometimes it's nothing. Do you think we're going to see the phrase, the turkey will be the oven then? Yeah. Do you think the phrase sufficiently restrictive level for some time will be in the Fed. I do. I think so. It seems to be a common refrain here. But we get that. You do get some economic data. I think we, some home sales data, some earnings as well. So it is still a better read on the economic picture. And then of course, there's all the focus on Black Friday. And what that means for a consumer spending curl. Do you go out on Black Friday now? No, no, no, no. I do so much online. No, I stay away. I think it's too crazy. But you're absolutely right. Consumers, we say to million times, so important to our economy, whether or not they're going to be out in full force, we're all going to be parsing over the activity on Friday and through the weekend. And to Black Monday, which is now Black Tuesday, which is now. Cyber Monday. You're cyber Monday here. Sorry. Doesn't matter though. I mean, everybody's already started their sales already. I mean, what do you want? I really bought Christmas stuff. Oh, did you get us? Yeah.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,648,2022-11-18 21:08:10
18035," Tuesday, which is now cyber. Monday. Sorry. Doesn't matter though. Everybody's already started their sales already. I mean, what do you know? I really bought Christmas stuff. Oh, did you get us candles? I think that's what we got. Yeah. Hey, busy balls. You know, in all seriousness, I think of all the data we get next week. To me, the most important will be the real time credit card data around what happens on Friday. And then Adobe is also really great with what's going on online with cyber Monday. And cyber Monday really starts on Thursday night at this point. So getting an understanding of what consumers are doing. And the way prices are falling or really if there is, you know, we're seeing that pressure kind of taken off in some of these, you know, we're seeing inventories move higher in some areas too. I'm excited to see what company comes out with bad news because next week would be the time to bury it to release it at Wednesday at 4 p.m. when no one's paying any attention. Like, no, I'll be working. I'll be paying attention. Well, okay. Romain will get you. I'm working to remain so we can. Thank you. We can measure it together. Yeah, I will. So, if we go somewhere. Somebody's got to support the network. Just going to say. No, but you can get a name like dear. I feel like this is always an interesting team in terms of agricultural, whether companies are committing to pay thousands of dollars for some of their equipment. That's a lot about the company. There's been a pretty resilient too. I mean, obviously, we know they have a big link to China and the home building or construction building over there as well as agriculture. Be interested in see how that holds up. Yep. All right. I'm thinking about Turkey. All right. Well, it's going. It's going. I don't know. Are you biking to wherever you're going? I will not be doing any biking too cold. Yeah. Headed to Cincinnati looking forward to it. It's a natty. Yeah. All right. We're done. We're done. I'm ready for the weekend. All right. It's pizza time. Yeah. All right. Have a good weekend, guys. That is a wrap. That is a wrap for our cross-platform coverage radio TV YouTube. Also on Bloomberg Quick Take. Have a good weekend. We will see the gang. Same time. Same place on Monday. You're listening to Bloomberg Business Week with Carol Masser and Bloomberg Quick Take's Tim Stenevek on Bloomberg Radio. So you are listening and watching Bloomberg Business Week. Carol Masser along with Tim Stenevek. You know, I was thinking about what we're talking about with Scarlett and Romaine. And the one thing too that Aaron Kenan said is, you know, what do margins do in a slower growth world? And actually, as he said, higher wages, it's a sticky component when it comes to inflation, right? You can't give somebody a raise and then take away right away. You can't. And it sticks around in something like the CPR, what have you. So will that impact company margins? Well, that's start to play out in earnings. And especially if the economy slows down. That's when you start to have some problems and you look at valuation. You're looking over the then job openings numbers, right? Yeah. There are still so many jobs available to people who are looking. And we're look at. And we're look at God's saying, we're the workers. Yeah. I want to get these numbers in here, Carol, because the doubt flat on the week, the S&P 500 down 7, 10% on the week, the NASDAQ down 1.6%. And that was after that surge the week before, right? Exactly. That was really outstanding. Certainly if you were a bull in this marketplace. All right. Back to world of national news, back to Denise Cohen Greeny, she is the inheritor. Hey, Denise. Hey, Carol. Thank you. Attorney General, Marik Garland announcing he is appointing a prosecutor, special prosecutor Jack Smith, special counsel to oversee justice department investigations involving former president Trump. Here's Garland, a special counsel. He will exercise independent prosecutorial judgment to decide whether charges should be brought. And those investigations will include the transfer of power up to an including January 6th. And also the classified documents found at Trump's Mar-a-Lago. There's a tentative labor agreement in place for railroad workers, but if the union votes know could be some drama this weekend, Congress might have to step in more from Bloomberg Xamie Morris. The main grievance, never knowing when you'll have time off, the tentative agreement addresses that forcing railroads to address scheduling rules. But workers say the pack that Labor Secretary Marty Walsh helped negotiate in September doesn't go far enough. And a no vote by the two largest rail unions on Sunday could lead to a crippling walkout in early December. In addition to schedules, the 115,000 employees are upset about working shorthanded during the pandemic, frozen wages and increased health costs. In Washington, I'm Amy Morris, Bloomberg Radio.

And Polar Cars and the mayor of Buffalo telling people just stay home this weekend. Don't even bother to go out until Monday. Global News 24 hours a day on air and on Bloomberg Quick Take powered by more than 2700 journalists of analysts. Thank you so much. Karl Maserton, Stenevich here in our Bloomberg Interactive Broker Studio. Corvana, we've been talking about this company a lot. Yeah, it got hit today after the company said that it will eliminate about 1500 jobs. It's not just the growing list of layoffs that it adds to when you see across corporate America, right? The layoffs that we started to get from Amazon this week last week it was Meta Platforms. And it's also specific to the company because we see a slowdown in use the used car market. And it's a good portion of the company. Eight percent of the company's workforce that's according to a spokesperson today. I don't understand. I mean, this stock is down. You said you guys were just talking about a percent right year to date. From a ties. Okay. 96 percent year to date. So almost 40 percent of the float is shorted. So people are anticipating. I don't know how much further it can go down. But what happened? Is that a play on the economy? What is the pandemic? What is that? I can't answer that question for you, but I can tell you if you look at the longer term chart, what you can see is it's back to levels that it was pre pandemic. So this is where it was. So I mean, what are they selling? I guess this is what, you know, we need to know. We know prices of used vehicles slid in October for the fifth straight month. According to the man, I'm used vehicle value index. That shift has been a substantial drag on Carvana's business and his word wall street analyst with Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas saying recently that this stock could be worth as little as a dollar. It's really, really wild to see. I mean, that was a few weeks ago. Yeah. That so, you know, that was, I mean, that was sort of, that wasn't what kicked us off because the company's been under pressure for quite a bit of time. As you mentioned, used car prices for October fell. Right. Carvana though this month cited the weakening used car market and the broader economy when it's quarterly earnings, missed analyst estimates. The company though, the latest in the series of firms across industries to trim its ranks as conditions deteriorate, FedEx said earlier this week it's going to furlough some workers. But I think this is different because this is a company that's under, has been under way more pressure than those other companies that have done layoffs. And it says to me that there's a lot more new cars out there. So if you, that's what you want, you can get it despite the chip shortage stories we've heard. So changing dynamics, certainly.

18038, sent you to date but more than about thirty percent since november nine that's when the company reported earnings after the close so let's get into it david joining us via zoom from torrents california david nice to have you here how are you i'm very good hi carol well tell us a little bit about the environment because it you know depending on where you are in kind of the auto world you might have a good story you might have a bad story so what's your story we have a very good story i'll tell you uh... you know we've been around for twenty five years and we just announced our eleventh consecutive order of double digit year-over-year growth uh... we just reported a hundred sixty four million dollars of sales are he'd be dies up a hundred seventy four percent so as a company we're doing great what's the environment look like because it is tough for some companies right now to navigate what's going on when it comes to supply chains when it comes to use car prices coming down david what are you seeing listen i'm seeing the environment changing around me every day you guys see it you are the consumer is getting pinched right at the gas pump at the grocery store with interest rates so you know it's an opportunity for companies like us to double down on efficiencies and double down on continuous improvement and figuring out a way how to pass on savings to the customers and give them a reason to shop with us well so when you are doubling down and thinking about where to conserve or not uh... we talked about carvana planning to lay off about eight percent of its staff that was the headline that we had uh... today are you guys bracing um... david in your story for a slow down are you bracing for a recession and might layoffs be a part of that you know i i think the environment is definitely changing and it's a good time to double down on you know free cash flow staying that free positive unit economics and really really go back to the fundamentals of serving the customer needs so for us it's been a laser focus on number one customer experience and number two being fiscally conservative so we've always been very fiscally conservative especially over the last three years you know we have a more free cash flow positive or virtually debt free as we get into twenty twenty three which might be a recession uh... it's an opportunity to really double down on that all right so but as you double down as you said i mean customers come first you need people to make sure customers come first but if you are feeling the pressure i mean are all bets often meaning that if you need to cut costs and if that means workers that could happen yeah i i don't think we're in that position i think we've been in a good spot for the last three years we've been very disciplined about you know increasing headcounts uh... so right now we're in a good position and we also have a ton of opportunities operationally to find efficiencies not only on the marketing side on the technology side using data science using continuous improvement so i'd say you know for us at carparts dot com we're in a good spot you guys offer hundreds of uh... thousands of skews uh... give us a percentage though in the last couple of years in the supply chain crunches prices have gone up how much your cost of going up on these parts how much i need to raise prices for the consumer yeah definitely we've seen some pressure on the supply chain not only in the cost of raw materials but also inbound transportation and outbound transportation so it's been across the board not unlike the other uh... traditional retailers or brick and mortar retailers it's been in the double digits obviously we have you know what we think is a competitive advantage we have a vertically integrated supply chain and we always try to pass on whatever savings we can get to the customer but to your point yes the last couple years have been tough for for the customer and it's been you know double digits for sure double digits like are we talking ten percent twenty percent forty percent somewhere between ten and twenty okay the last couple years so we could say teens yeah we like to got there zero in there we do you're you're being a good player david hey i i i would i am where you know as to mention lots of skews lots of manufacturing how has the geopolitical instabilities um... the trade pushback the pushback against globalization um... how is that impacting you about where you want to manufacture everything yeah that's a very good question and it's something that we've been thinking about for a very long time uh... you know we source parts look globally now obviously there is a high concentration in you know in aia and so we've been looking to diversify our supply chain and over the last couple of years we added some supply out of south america uh... out of europe and i think long term as the business continues to grow you know we're always going to be sourcing parts from,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,652,2022-11-18 21:25:18
18039," Over the last couple of years, we added some supply out of South America, out of Europe, and I think long-term, as the business continues to grow, we're always going to be sourcing parts from Asia, but there's opportunities in other places. So for us, we built, we've actually made some investments to build a global sourcing team. Now the first, you know, the main focus is quality, right? We're always looking for quality parts, but obviously the global geopolitical environment comes into play for sure. David, when you say Asia, do you mean China manufacturing in particular? Actually, a lot of what we source is from Taiwan. Okay. So, you know, we carry about 80,000 skews, individual skews in our supply chain, and a lot of those come from Taiwan, which historically has been a very good partnership for us. A lot, very stable. What about Mexico? A Mexico, we're actually starting to source from Mexico. There's been a lot of improvements, and a lot of investments to be made in manufacturing in Mexico. What it allows to do is, you know, shorter lead times, so it's faster, and it makes our inventory more productive. So Mexico is for sure a big opportunity. All right. We got to run. Hey, listen, so good to check in with you on this Friday. Have a good holiday next week, and look forward to getting another update. Hopefully, soon down the road. David, be well. David Ben-Ran, he is CEO of carparts.com and joining us via Zoom from Torrance, California. I like that. Yeah, that's interesting, right?

We're going to talk about a lot of stuff in terms of the advertising market. We're going to talk about the media space, social media space, a lot to get to. Maybe we won't talk about FTX. I can't promise you that. I can't promise. I don't know. I don't know. Well let's get over to Charlie Pellet. I am. We got a lot going on.

18041," Right here on Bloomberg Business Week. Yeah, the markets currently pricing another 100 basis points. They've already done 400. And so we're in the latter innings of a tightening cycle. And we're starting to see in simpient levels of deceleration on inflation. And so, you know, I think that bodes well for, you know, the Fed to get out of our way for at least a back half of 2023. And right now we've got the 10 year yielding 3.82% the two year 4.52% spot-called 1749 YAHMS while West Texas, intermediate crew down 1.7% 80, 23 a barrel. The Justice Department, according to sources, is probing live nation entertainment and its ticket master unit over whether the entertainment giant is abusing its power over the live music industry. Today shares of the live nation company down by 7.9%. And FedEx has diffused a threat by its delivery contractors to walk off the job on Black Friday in protest of dwindling profits as a trade group representing disgruntled logistics company owners, dispans. Today we got FedEx shares up by 1.9%. I'm Charlie Petlup, let's name the guest. And that's a Bloomberg business flash. It's a new game show right here on Bloomberg Business Week. All right, our next guest is an entrepreneur, co-founder of a couple of companies, including the one he runs now, former president of Asia at Electronic Arts. He was there for seven years before that president of Asia Pacific at Walt Disney International. It has been a few years, but really great to have back with us. Yeah, we got John Neerman with us right now. He's with us in the Bloomberg Interactive, Brokers, Studio. As you mentioned, Carol, the co-founder and CEO of Loop Media Plus done a bunch of other really cool stuff in his career. John, we're going to dive into your company in a minute. And we got a lot of time with you this afternoon. So we're excited to do this. But I want to go to the broader advertising market right now. We do hear about concern from social media companies, for example. I don't know your focus is out of home. Yeah. But we're out of home a lot when we're using social media. So just give us your assessment of where the market is right now. It's companies are tightening their belts and they're pulling back on their ad spending. Everybody's it's all doom and gloom, right? It's just falling apart. It's tanking. If you look at, if you hear from Snap, now I don't agree with that. You're saying that's what you're doing. I'm saying that's what you're doing. You're saying that's what you're doing. No, I'm not coming out strong. Now, I'm coming out saying that's not entirely accurate. I think a certain segment. If you look at advertising across the board, you've got the traditional advertising, linear TV, outdoor, et cetera. Now, 55% of the people are doing digital advertising. So yeah, social media in that area, which has grown robustly, has taken a hit. But areas like connected television, your road, whose are the word your Pluto's, et cetera, they're growing digital out of home, are also growing. Those are the two areas we play in. So I don't agree with this kind of blanket statement of, it's just all bad. But would you agree with the blanket statement that companies are tightening their belts? And when companies do tighten their belts, one of the first things to go is marketing money. I would agree with that. Yes, but I also think they refocus it. So if you're people are going out again, as we know. And like a couple of years ago, even the past year, people are going out. It's a great captive audience. They're out for a good time. They're having a good time. So targeting groups like that out of home, as opposed to just your mobile phone all the time, is something that people are expanding into. How do you do that? So like loop media, we have a platform that's advertising supported. We're in any public venue as small as a pub to as large as the university campus. So whether you're a dry cleaner, a tattoo parlor, a CDB store, or you name it, they have screens. So we create a network basically out of home. Previously, these were all kind of disconnected. Think about where homes were 10 years goes, cable and satellite. That's still where businesses are. They don't really have a streaming option, and that's what we're bringing to them. You don't go to a restaurant and watch a movie. And basically all streaming services or movies or TV series. It's your seven year old you do. Yes, you do, right? Depends, give you an iPad. And they say, watch this movie where we have a nice peaceful dinner. Exactly. We go to a sports bar. They're constantly playing catty shack the whole time. There's nothing wrong with that. So help me understand. So exactly what you're doing. So you're going into spaces that maybe typically did not have advertising before. Correct. So previously, so in our world, we're not really about subscribers. That's a consumer. So how many subscribers you have? For us, it's how many locations are you in. So we provide that as ad supported for free. Coming out of the pandemic, people got all these costs to worry about.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,655,2022-11-18 21:38:25
18042," subscribers you have for us at Tell me locations are you in? So we provide that as ad supported for free. Coming out of the pandemic people had all these costs to worry about labor, food, etc. The last thing they're worried about is spending money on a TV screen but they didn't have that free option before. So in order to get that free content and digital signage you need advertising to support it obviously. So people are moving part of their media mix into this digital out of home space which you'll hear more and more of. What's the growth that you've seen? Give me where were you pre-pandemic versus pre-pandemic? Where are you today? We were about three million dollars in acquired revenue. We were basically a startup. You know we had bought a small company that provided music videos to out of home. Right. And this past year we finished five million. We haven't released our fiscal however the analyst estimate is around 30 million for us to go from five to 30. Is that realistic? Yeah. So if you kind of look at that that's yeah that's the type of growth that you're looking at. Which venues in particular are providing the biggest momentum for you guys? You mentioned restaurants. So you tell me if I go to Danielle? You can go to Margaritaville right down here in Times Square. So not Danielle. You could. Yeah. Yeah. So if I go to Margaritaville where am I going to see the screen at the bar? You're going to see it at the bar. You're going to see it in common areas. You're going to see it in the lobby. Okay. You know we're also in 400,000 hotel rooms. Okay. So you know we provide largely about 40% of our business of bars and restaurants. The rest are just kind of other retail. John yeah 40 seconds right now then we're going to come back with you tracking ROI. How do you tell clients what they get what their return is? So for them it's really a couple things. One is about cost savings. So what used to cost them they can actually earn a little bit of money because we do provide a rewards program. So when you use our service you keep the screens on you have a chance to earn some cash. So that's a great thing for their balance sheet. The second thing is really this the opportunity for them to engage the customers and you know when people are engaged they stay longer and they spend more. So there are quite a few studies that actually show when that entertainment is good in house. People are sticking around. See putting word on there. Yeah but we do have a trivia channel. It works. I'm like addicted to these games. We're going to come back with John Neerman. He's co-founder Chief Executive Officer of Loop Media joining us here in our interactive broker studio. Did he spell a greenie standing by right now? She's got nothing on world and national news in the Bloomberg newsroom. Hey there. Thank you Tim and Attorney General Merrick Garland appointing a special counsel as we've been reporting to oversee justice department investigations involving former president Trump. Now this will include a transfer of power up to and including January 6th in correction and the investigation into the presence of those classified documents at Mara Lago and Garland says it all underscores and the appointing of the special counsel underscores the department's commitment to independence and accountability in these very sensitive issues. It also allows prosecutors and agents to continue their work expeditiously and to make decisions indisputably guided only by the facts and the law. And Garland says Jack Smith will be heading home from the Hague where he's been working on war crimes. North Korea confirming it conducted an intercontinental ballistic missile test yesterday. Leader Kim Jong-un saying the country is strengthening its nuclear deterrence by his president Kamala Harris denouncing North Korea's latest weapons test. We strongly condemn these actions and we again call for North Korea to stop further unlawful these stabilizing acts. And Harris speaking from Thailand alongside world leaders at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit and the Justice Department as we've been talking about probing live nation entertainment and its ticket master unit over whether the entertainment giant is abusing its power over the live music industry that is according to sources. Now these probes come amid the whole debacle with the Taylor Swift thing she says ticket master let her down after making promises. It's worth noting this antitrust investigation began earlier this year before the Swift ticketing fiasco global news 24 hours a day on air and on Blueberg quick take I'm Denise Pellegrini this is Bloomberg.

18043," I'm Janice Pellegrini. This is Bloomberg. All right Denise. Thank you so much. Carol Master, Long-Aid Tim Stenevich, live on Bloomberg Business. We're going to get back to John Neerman of Loop Media. Neerman, excuse me, of Loop Media in just a moment. In the meantime, get to talk about our weekend show. Yeah, in our weekend show, we got to look at the Bloomberg Pursuits Guide to Holiday and Retaining Carol. In this excerpt, Bloomberg Pursuits Editor Chris Rouser. Yeah, really good timing. We're also joined by Bloomberg Food Editor, Kate Crater, not Kate Crater. Well, you could call it Kate Crater after you hear this. Because she talked about some mouthwatering delights in the magazine. A lot of people during the pandemic started baking cakes. They started baking bread and then a lot of the rest of us looked at those people and said, man, I wish I had some bread and some cake, but I am sure not baking it. I was one of those. So we started having cakes delivered from Gold Belly and that has continued on even as the pandemic has lightened. And every year we have a holiday entertaining section in Bloomberg Pursuits, one of our favorite sections. Kate usually takes charge and we really wanted to do cakes this year. If we felt like everybody needed a slice of cake. So Kate picked out some of the best new and regional cakes to really highlight across the US. I want to know, Kate, how the heck do you, oh, is I'm always amazed because there's so much stuff out there. How you whittle it down? Well, you know, it's so much work and research, Carol. A lot of eating, a lot of work. Hold on, I can't tell if you're joking here. Like it's so hard to just, you know, trial these cakes and order these cakes. But it is hard, right? You know, at some point, at some point you can kind of hit cake overload, but it takes a lot of research for that to happen. But it's really, it's just cakes are so great. Like they look wonderful. And this is, you know, around the holiday time, it's usually pie season. And a lot of people will talk about pies, but people usually make those pies. And I'm like you, I will eat cakes all day, but I don't really want to make them. And so, and same with pies. Like, so it's great to have a cake because it shows up. Like I think pies are sort of sitting on the table. But it cake stands tall. It's hours over everything else. So in the pie versus cake debate, cake will always win. For more catch our business week, we can show tomorrow at 8 a.m. on radio.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,657,2022-11-18 21:47:08
18044," From the world, I'm Charlie Pellet, the light volume today, an update for the Dow, the S&P and NASDAQ for the week. However, the S&P 500 index was down 7 tenths of 1% today, the S&P up 18 points again, the error of 5 tenths of 1%. Dow industrials up 199 higher by 6 tenths of 1% NASDAQ, just about flat on the day, weighing out a gain of 1 point. 10 year yield 3.82% of the 2 year yielding 4.52%, spot gold 1750, the ounce down 6 tenths of 1%, bitcoin today down 2 tenths of 1% 16,641, while it was Texas, and the video crude oil was down 1.9%. $80, 9 cents a barrel on WTI again, recapping. Turned out to be an update for the Dow, the S&P and NASDAQ losing week, S&P today up by 5 tenths of 1%. I'm Charlie Pellet and that is a Bloomberg Business Flash. Alright, I want to get back to our conversation with John Nearman, he's co-founder and chief executive officer of Loop Media. As we said, there are multi-channel streaming platform. Is that the right way to describe you guys? It's in your press releases, but does that really do it? Yes, it does. We kind of move towards digital out of home video streaming company, because as you've evolved in industries, if you like that, DOH, it's such corporate. It is. Say it, Carol. So, you're at a bar with your best friend, Joe or Jane, and they say, what the heck do you do? So you stream videos, your video streaming company into public spaces, so bars rest, you know, so any company can do it. Any company can do it. They just need to find us, we get them a loop player, they plug in the loop player. Previously, you'd have these giant AV racks, you know, you go to, we have, you're dating yourself, I go, I know, thank you. But even though you go to your hard house and you can get big Dell computer there, and they're clunky and horrible and expensive, and now you just plug and play, like you do at home. Is what you plug in a hard drive or a, you know, stored memory device, or does it give wireless access to the network? It's a little network. Well, it's an Android player, you're just plugging in the back. It's like the size of an Apple TV. So kind of a three by three thing. Does it connect to a network, or does it have a hard drive? Wi-Fi, you can also do Ethernet, and it does, it does cache content, because in case Wi-Fi goes down, you don't want to have, it'd be left without content. I want to go back to the question that I had before, because I, I want to go back to",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,658,2022-11-18 21:51:32
18045," I also do Ethernet and it does cash content because in case wife I go down, you don't want to have, you'd be left without content. I want to go back to the question that I had before. Cause I, yeah, John, with all the respect, you didn't really answer it, but maybe I asked it in a bad way. Okay. I know. Are you crazy? No, you're gonna get rid of that. What, you know, the content that you play in these out of home spaces, it's supported by advertisers. Correct. What I want to know is how advertisers who work with you know they're getting eyeballs, know they're getting a return on their investment that they're making. So currently they basically put advertising in there to have the opportunity to be exposed to multiple people in the room. Think of it this way, when you're at home watching your movie, it's you one on one. So advertisers paying for that one on one. When you're out of home, it's a multiplier. You could have 15 people within the range of that. Now we're working with CommScore to try to get some measurement in there. There's also third parties like Geopath that measure people that are in that can basically through Wi-Fi can tell how many mobile phones are in the room. So you get a good indicator of how many people are in that room at any one time. So you pay, it sort of judged the way that maybe some would out of home, like a billboard, right? Yeah. So a billboard costs a certain amount of money based on where it is, who drives by it and how many people drive by it. That's right. So that's how we have to think of this product too. It's the same thing as the CPMs which you would do pay online. It's the same thing. Right. Cost per thousand is what that stands for. Thank you. Exactly. You're right. It's fun to watch. It's like a tennis match. Go ahead. My answer again now. Oh, yeah. Yeah, you're getting all right. So it's, no, but it's a great question because it's, this is new. I mean, it's odd as it sounds. Everybody's been focused on consumer streaming. Right. It's Roku, it's Pluto, it's Disney Plus, it's everyone there. But out of home, those things don't play. They don't work. The content isn't right. They're licensing isn't there. So we've kind of quietly gone about finding that world of tens of millions of screens, beautiful screens out there with tons of eyeballs, providing content that works, music videos. We lead basically all 50 states, national music video promotion. So we're the amazing. We're the biggest TV now. It's you guys. Yeah, that's right. They're right. Bring me my loop or whatever. So I got to get a cover. I won't move. Yeah, that's it. So loop me in. It's a keep going. I love it. You used to play the hardware too. We do. So we could do it with our own loop player, but we also have a partner network. So for example, we're in about 17,000 convenience store point of sale systems. Right. Truly last mile advertising. Think you're in line. You got the little thing at the end that says itemize as you receive. Boom. There's a Snickers commercial right there. Oh, Snickers right here and pull spy. So it's really that last opportunity for the advertiser to grab that consumer when they're actually out making a purchase. So what does an ad spot cost? That's CPMs vary. You know, they're kind of in between five to 15 depending on the day, but yes, but then a multiplier. OK. So what you can do without a home if there's 10 people in there, you could put that 10 times multiply and they advertise a pay for that. It seems like your competitive advantage is relationships that you build up with the places where the screens are. Yes. What about the technologies? Is there any technology that you have that a competitor couldn't come in with? It's an Android player. So it's proprietary technology for us. We make it on our own and it's got everything you need in terms of putting your optical on your sound and all that good stuff. So it's of course, a competitor could come in and do it. It's just like you could have other type of hardware. However, you know, it's really about creating some, it's harder to get the distribution. Yeah. So anybody can actually make a piece of hardware, but ours, by the way, is developed by a guy named Liam McCallum and getting them a plug. He was one of the heads of digital electronic arts that built up EAs online gaming platform. Right. So this guy is built a very special robust platform for us, which allows us to run that many 160 channels in all these locations. So it really is about getting distribution to him. That's the main thing of how you really grow that business. What's your biggest cost? The biggest cost is really marketing. Okay. And that's not that big, not even for consumer. So customer acquisition? Customer acquisition. But we have a pretty quick payback. You know, so we're not really worried about that. We put all of...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,659,2022-11-18 21:55:44
18046," for consumer. So customer acquisition? Customer acquisition. But we have a pretty quick payback. So we're not really worried about that. We've put all of our money in development. We're not putting any sort of giant working capital in development or anything like that. It really is about getting the word out. And then having people understand this exists. So it sounds like it's difficult. It's difficult for people just to know about us. Yeah. Look at how many questions we've peppered you in. No, I love it. I love it. I was just saying when you're making, like I'm just wondering, like when you're making the pitch, are people like, oh, yeah, I totally get this. Usually it's too good to be true. So what's the catch? It's free. You're giving me all this content. You're giving me digital signage. I have to pay hundreds if not thousands, depending on the size, if they're an enterprise, or if they're a mom and pop. But then the best results are the testimonials. The people that actually will go online and social and tell their friends. And then we get a franchise like McDonald's. And then another franchise will come in. So it really is proving yourself. Individual McDonald's franchise. Yes, not for McDonald's as an entire court. And you just want the eyeballs. We want the eyeballs. So what the eyeballs? What does your sales force look like? We've got a terrific chief revenue officer called Bob Grooters. Yeah. And he came from Facebook. Bob I hope you're listening. By he came from Facebook. He has 30 years of advertising experience. But is your sales force picking up the phone and cold calling individual restaurant franchises with a number of restaurants to try to get some of your sales and things? Yes. So in-house, we have an enterprise sales team. We have an affiliate team that we basically work with. They're basically literally thousands of ground, boots on the ground that are roaming around. And then we have a college marketing program because colleges are a big target. All the bars and restaurants around campus. So you have that sports content. So we're a pretty small company. We have about 66 people. We're not about let's, oh, we've got 300 people. Aren't we amazing? We want to keep that ideally a small-type team and utilize people that are already out there. It's like having to prep for an IPO road show or something. I love it. You're already public. You're already public. I know they are. But you're already. I our team didn't say, hey, John, we have an interview. Actually, this is a prep. Very interesting. Come back. Keep us posted. Love it too. Thank you for having me. As things continue, because it's a very interesting part of the advertising world. Really cool. John Neumann, I have a great holiday. And thank you for coming in.

18047," hope to the CFO on Thursday continuing to push higher. A lot of analysts raising their price targets on that stock as it remains resilient despite acknowledging a slowdown in its customer base. Applied materials also proving resilient as the demand for consumer electronics drops. Remember, applied materials also has a broader offering on chips. Grindr making its public market debut going public via SPAC, surging 213%. We're going to get into that. It's amazing, isn't it? To see on the screen that number will get into it as well as a broader discussion around the SPAC mechanism with Grindr's CEO later in the show. Tesla is interesting. No real Tesla-specific news, down 1.6%. But I just want to make the quick point, Caroline, that Tesla is now down more than 20% since Elon Musk closes deal to buy Twitter on October 28th. There's obviously concern in the market here. Whether it's Elon Musk being distracted at Twitter and not playing attention to Tesla or something more than that. But that's a really interesting three-week chart to me. And let's talk about, of course, where Elon Musk has been distracted. Because there have been so many updates on this day alone about Twitter, Ed. And the latest being an email apparently that he sent out to all employees just before 9am local time, an urging employees and engineers there are to fly to San Francisco, to be there in person for a meeting at the social media platforms headquarters that very afternoon. Let's break this all down. Brad Stone, I'm pleased to say, head of Bloomberg's global technology coverage. Brad, an extraordinary story that continues to unfold. What did you make of that email alone? I mean, I would say I was surprised, Caroline, but nothing these past few weeks have surprised me. I think the thing that jumps out is the remarkable inconsistency. I mean, wasn't it just yesterday? And again, I've lost all track of time here. But just yesterday, Elon closed down Twitter headquarters until the Monday after Thanksgiving. And of course, let go, you know, another round of employees via his ultimatum to workers. Now, you know, it shouldn't be surprising. He seems to be operating by the seat of his pants, but closing Twitter offices and then asking employees, the remaining engineers to come help basically save the code base by coming into the offices is quite a turn about. And we worried as users about the stability of this platform, but it's also got the attention of regulators and lawmakers, first of all, most here in the US. I would actually say, first and foremost, in the EU. Twitter is absolutely on a collision course with European regulators. There's this thing called the Digital Services Act, which is going into effect, basically, at the beginning of 2023, they've been talking about it for years. The very large tech platforms have to report their numbers. And if they qualify as being large, then they're going to basically have to, you know, make some assurances around content moderation and algorithmic transparency. And this is at a point where none of those workers are responsible for those areas that Twitter are left. They've all left the company. And so you hear European regulators saying that they might make Twitter a test case. Brad, hello. You wrote a column the other day that Elon Musk is trying to pull off a sort of Steve Jobs' size turnaround at Twitter based on all the reporting that I've done, that all the reporters and editors that report into you have done. How's that turnaround going? I think said I drew the comparison that jobs returning to Apple in the mid-1990s. And there are certain similarities. I mean, jobs streamline the company back then to a large degree. You remember stories about Apple employees walking into an elevator not being able to describe to their boss what they did and getting fired. I think the difference is Elon's been much more destructive than jobs was back back in the day. And jobs was returning to a company he knew intimately well. He was a co-founder of Apple and Elon's coming to a company where he was a power user, but maybe didn't understand or doesn't understand the culture and the infrastructure and the product quite as well. So it's early. And look, I've always said Twitter is the company that can't kill itself. It's just way too addictive and effective a product. So I'm not one of those who thinks Twitter is going away, but the last three weeks he's taking it in the wrong direction. Well, I wanted to ask you about that. Caroline and I took part in that...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,661,2022-11-18 22:08:04
18048," So I'm not one of those who thinks Twitter is going away, but the last three weeks he's taken it in the wrong direction. Well, I wanted to ask you about that. Caroline and I took part in actually a couple of Twitter spaces on Friday, one that we hosted, and then I joined Kurt Wagner's social power hour. And if anything, you still see people on the platform, one of the issues now is that everyone has a blue tick. And look on the Bloomberg term, and on much of the new cycle is about the content moderation and authenticity and bot user issue. What is your read on what's going on on that side of the platform? Well, it's interesting because we had this letter from Cory Booker and some other senators today urging the FDC to go kind of take a look at Twitter. It's it's conduct with rolling out the Twitter blue verified platform, which then Elon rescinded it and has now talked about suspending for a couple more weeks. And how much just chaos that unleashed where you had impersonators of President Biden and other world leaders and companies like Eli Lilly and all the instability there, prominent figures being basically spoofed on the platform. And look, I mean, some of this was predictable, probably eminently so to people who have worked at Twitter a long time. But Elon, he's gotten as far as he's gotten by not listening to people, by going against the grain and listening to his own intuition. And for a lot of his career, that's worked out quite well. And with regards to Twitter right now, it hasn't. And I think there's going to be a lot of blowback from the FDC from the EU, from other regulators as he tries to straighten us out. Interesting that this is such a global story. As you say, the EU regulators looking in, we understand maybe the Spanish government, the German government having to respond to questions as to whether they should keep their Twitter handles on the product to tool Brad. What about the global nature of the owners of this business? Now, there is still some questions about CIFIAs or indeed about some sort of investigation as to whether Qatar, Saudi Arabian money should be helping own this business. Right. And there was, I think, another letter by Senator Mark Warner from Virginia. Basically, he's the chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, you know, raising concerns about those outside investors. But also the reliance of Elon Musk's other businesses on other countries, for a China, for example, and the strength of Tesla in China. And it raises all sorts of concerns, you know, particularly when those countries are also, you know, regulating Twitter, when they have interest in maybe styming some free speech on the platform, Elon has put himself in a unique and extraordinarily difficult situation. And I do expect different countries to kind of look at that and interpret it differently. Brad, what are we trying to find out next? What is the kind of big question that hangs over Twitter outside of the regulatory side of things? I think right now it's a culture issue. It's who's left? Who's going to rebuild this thing? Who's going to keep it operating? I mean, that's really the question that everybody's asking. Well, it's Twitter going to be there when we check it in the morning. You know, that's the first question. And then I think the second has some of these big debt payments come due at the beginning of 2023. You know, what is the business look like right now? You've had so many advertisers leave the platform. Twitter blue, if it shows results, they're not going to be immediate. So can you rebuild this as a business? And can you turn it around and maybe start to grow it again? Those are the questions that we'll be looking at going in the next year. Now, we just want to pivot a little bit with you, Brad, being of course the global head of technology. We can do this because the judge in the Elizabeth Holmes trial at the moment, Judge DeVilla, is giving a lengthy explanation ahead of sentencing. And we have had some headlines saying there's no question that Ms. Holmes is bright, says the judge, and just now saying Elizabeth Holmes' judge is pointing to the many misrepresentations. Everyone's waiting with baited breath as to what the length of time could be here. What's top of mind for you? Well, Carol, I mean, that's a, I guess, maybe a personal question. Obviously, I'm curious what the verdict is. I would be interested in seeing maybe a little bit of equity reflected in the decision. What I mean by that is Elizabeth Holmes was, she seemed unique back when this story was breaking a couple of years ago. And since then, we've had Adam Newman that we work. And no.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,662,2022-11-18 22:12:32
18049," by that is, you know, Elizabeth Holmes was, you know, she, she, she, she seemed unique back when this story was breaking a couple of years ago. And since then we've had Adam Newman that we work. And now more recently, Samuel Bankman freed at FTX. And the size and the scale of the fraud is almost just as draw a draw, again, I know there are different situations. And, and the health of patients was at play in the Theranos case. But, you know, Adam, Adam Newman starting a new business and SPF, while he may be arrested as a free man in the Bahamas. And I guess I would, I'm curious to see, you know, how the, how the legal process plays out with this very prominent female founder. Visavis, some of these more explicit examples of, of male founders in fraud. Brad, this is probably a difficult question for me to ask you. But what is the health of the founder broadly right now in Silicon Valley and the world that we cover? You've written a lot about Amazon Jeff Bezos has kind of taken a step back. Elizabeth Holmes is a different example of a founder that's moved on Jack Dorsey is nowhere to be seen at Twitter, for example. And there, there don't seem to be as many superstar founders right now out there in the world that you and I operate it. I would say the mystique of the founder is, is cracked for, for sure, all the examples that you've cited. But it's, it's, I think it's so strong and it's so foundational to the Silicon Valley myth that I think we'd be making a mistake if we said that the next iconoclastic genius founder who comes along isn't, you know, isn't going to have as much success with Sandhill road and venture capital. I think that, you know, we have all these examples, but you play them against the examples of everything Bezos created at Amazon and Steve Jobs and and and the the mystique is there. It might be cracked, but I don't think the the founder visionary genius CEO that that archetype is going anywhere in Silicon Valley. I think it's foundational. Do you think with potentially a strong signal being sent to future founders by this sentencing and by what's occurring with SBF, the, the focus of many a more experienced money manager that should have been, oh, we actually have the breaking news that Elizabeth Holmes has been sentenced to 135 months for their on us fraud. So nowhere near the top end of the years, Ed, just go out to you quickly because of course you're on top of what we're expecting, expecting from the sentencing, but 135 months potentially on the lower end, but certainly worse than Elizabeth Holmes, her self-hood feared as many had been asking perhaps to be serving it at home. Okay, so this is slightly more than 11 years. Elizabeth Holmes has been sentenced to 135 months imprisonment for fraud, 135 months is just over 11 years. The guided range given by the judge based on the charges she was found guilty of based on the guidance from prosecutors was 11 to 14 years. So this is at the lower end of the stated range. Remember Caroline, prosecutors had asked for 15 years, the defense team had asked for 18 months or at home imprisonment or being confined to home instead of being imprisoned, but this and there's the red head crossing the Bloomberg terminal is official now. Elizabeth Holmes sentenced to 135 months for the fraud relating to pharanos, which is just little more than 11 years. Brad, back to you. Little over 11 years, what sort of signal does that sound? It sounds horrendous to me to feel that I would be incarcerated for that length of time. Yeah, no, 11 years for now a disgrace for our CEO with with one kid and another on the way. It's it's a tragedy like across the board and hopefully it does send a signal to other CEOs and other venture capitalists, but you know, Caroline, we're coming up with this major scandal in the crypto world and the lessons are there for the investors who who backed SPF and FTX and they were ignored. So I'd love to say that Silicon Valley has learned its lesson, but I think the history of financial scandal in this country and in the world is that there are always new mistakes to be made despite the hefty sentence that's been leveled here today. All right, Bloomberg's Brad Stone. Thank you. We're going to take a quick break and.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,663,2022-11-18 22:16:34
18050," is that there are always new mistakes to be made despite the hefty sentence that's been leveled here today. All right, Bloomberg's Brad Stone. Thank you. We're going to take a quick break and be right back with more details from the Elizabeth Holmes sentencing. Coming up, we'll also speak with the new Grindr CEO, George Arison, about everything from his first couple of months in the top role to his big ideas for the popular dating app. This is Bloomberg. The Sentencing has been read on Elizabeth Holmes, the founder of Theranos, being sentenced to 135 months for the fraud. That, of course, equates to a little more than 11 years in prison. And we understand that then the judge won't impose a fine, postpones restitution order, and also is getting three years supervised release after prison. All of this with the expectation we understand that it's likely to be appealed but for now Elizabeth Holmes being sentenced to an enormous more than 11 years prison for fraud, but noting that this was on the lower end of the maximum amount and we understand that Elizabeth Holmes is hugging her parents' in court after the sentence was imposed. We'll return to that in a moment, but now let's get you some more breaking news of the day. The Friday was a very big day for Grindr. The dating app, specialising in LGBTQ plus communities, saw it shares absolutely surge in its trading debut ed. Yeah, I've seen a few spat-listings in my time at this company, Carrow. This is impressive. Up more than 210 per cent. First day of trading after the des back from Thursday's close of the pre-spack trading. Two charts though that I want to look at really quickly to give some context here. First, look at the des back index on the Bloomberg terminal. This is a basket of 25 companies that have gone before Grindr and look at that two-year performance. I used two-year because two years ago there was euphoria around companies going public via SPAC. Look at how some of those companies have fared since then. Not so well. The second thing, the number of special purpose acquisition companies that are actually IPO-ing. In other words, the vehicles themselves that seek to go public and then merge with the company.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,664,2022-11-18 22:21:37
18051," The number of special purpose acquisition companies that are actually IPO-ing, in other words, the vehicles themselves that seek to go public and then merge with the company taking it public via the despect process has completely drained up. That's where it rats. So why is Grindr different? We'll ask the man behind it, Grindr's CEO, George Arison, of course, extraordinary day of celebration for you and one where we saw at the NYC the listing and of course, performances and a real celebration for what has been a momentous year for LGBTQ people as well. I'm interested in your perspective on, well, now as a public company, how it makes you different from a private company? Well, public companies have to have really good controls, which we're really excited to have. Secondly, we get to report numbers regularly and I think it'll be awesome to tell the story of how well our business is doing but also the story of what we do for the community that we serve because Grindr is not just a business, it's also a mission and our employees are really tired of the mission, our users are really tired of the mission. And then thirdly, Grindr moving forward is going to have a board of nine people governing the company, six of which are LGBTQ plus community members, which is completely incredible. That's never happened in the history of public companies and that just makes me so proud that that's the company that we're going to be. George, the overwhelming number of investors voted in favor of the reverse merger, not sure how surprising that is. What is it that you think was so convincing? Is it actually Grindr and the opportunity for the business, the addressable market, or are you just another spack? Grindr is a really unique company because we are both growing really fast, but 30 plus percent year-over-year growth, while also we are profitable. And our EBITDA number is extremely strong and very, very positive and we expect that to continue in the years to come because our opportunity for growth is so strong ahead of us. And I think that makes us really unique, right? You showed this back index, well, you could put up a similar index for high growth money-loosing companies and they're going to be in a similar situation, right? Those correlate, I think in general, tech world has had a lot of companies not do well because they're losing money. Grindr is very different because it's making money while growing at a really fast clip. We're very early in our monetization journey. We only started to really charge for our services in the last three, four years and there's still a lot of monetization that we can achieve by having people pay for service that they really want, right? So we're building those products for them and then they're monetizing those. And that puts us, I think, in a really pole position to grow a revenue really nicely while doing it in a positive, unique, and I'm a way. I mean, Grindr is, I mean, it's a pretty amazing thing to say. We have nearly 200 million in revenue as a guidance point for this year and we're doing that with 200 people working at Grindr, right? So that I think is a pretty awesome story. Talk to us about, you speak very eloquently about your stakeholders in terms of people who work for you and the people that you serve through the app. Now your shareholders, the volatility is there because in large part there's a very small float and I'm interested as to whether you want to build that. Do you want to have more liquidity? You want to have more shares outstanding so that we don't get these huge sudden surges in the share price? Yeah, I mean, obviously we want to have a float that's much bigger and we want to spend time with investors telling them our story and having them invest. We've done somewhere that already. We've been out there talking to large investors that invest in companies like us and we'll continue to do that. I'm fortunate to have done this once before. I've taken another company public so that's something I enjoy doing. We have a very strong CFO who is very good at this as well and so we'll be out there telling our story and hopefully you know biggest issue investors who want to hold a stock for a long time and we'll come in and become a shareholder over the months to come. George, I'm really interesting about the concept of the app and how you make money in other ways. If you look for example a bumble and how they move away from just simply dating, what are the opportunities for you to branch out monetize new functionality? So obviously the majority of what we did today is around dating and relationships. People come to grind at two either have casual dating or long-term relationships or friendships and that we know that from all the data that we collect but we also know that people use grinder in a lot of other ways. Travels are a very logical example. People like take me right I couldn't be grinding or traveling from San Francisco to New York, longing in, talking to people about what I should stay, what I should do, what restaurants I should go to, what activities are happening. We don't monetize that at all now. We know people use grinder that way. It's like a very organ.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,665,2022-11-18 22:25:20
18052," And talking to people about where I should stay, what I should do, what restaurants I should go to, what activities are happening. We don't monetize that at all now. We know people use the grinder that way. It's like a very organic thing that happens in the app. But we don't actually monetize that feature or that set of features. Imagine a world where in Site Grindr we then actually give you a map of the place you're going to and say, hey, here are five hotels that our users really like. Here are the three restaurants that people really want to go to. And that can be monetized. So that's one of just many kind of product extensions that we are envisioning. Now, we're not going to launch these in 2023. These are all more long term because there's still so much low-hanging food in our core product that we can monetize. But over the long term, we see a ton of opportunity to kind of grow and really be a brand for the entire community. We have this 85% brand recognition among our community members, which is frankly incredible and priceless. Well, we need to take advantage of that and really serve them in many of our areas besides just the core dating features that Grindr has to do. Grindr CEO, George Harrison, thank you. We've got to run. Coming up. More on Elizabeth Holmes sentence next. This is Bloomberg. [♪ MUSIC SINGLE The Fair and O's founder, Elizabeth Holmes, has been sentenced with more than 11 years in prison for fraud relating to her time at the company. She will not face a fine but have three years of court supervision after that period. This is Bloomberg.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,666,2022-11-18 22:30:04
18053," And Welcome back to Bloomberg Technology. I'm Caroline Heide in New York along with Ed Ludlow in San Francisco and we've got to talk about Twitter again because it's closed. It's offices until Monday after Elon Musk gave staff an ultimatum to either commit to working long hours at high intensity or to leave. Sources say many more workers decided well to leave than he expected, potentially putting Twitter's operations at risk. A memo seen by Bloomberg also urges staff to refrain from discussing confidential information on social media or elsewhere. Bloomberg's intelligence, Mandi Singh, is with us following every nook and cranny of this story, Mandi. But ultimately, how worried are you about the product? How worried are you about the platform and its ability to continue being as rich as it is for people when there's no one really working there? Look, you make a great point that to keep a service like Twitter up, there's a lot that go behind the scenes in terms of interest structure and system software. And look, Twitter isn't even deployed on a public cloud that Amazon or Microsoft is taking care of the infrastructure. Twitter is still a lot of the services deployed on its own private data centers. So you need those type of resources. And with this kind of layoffs, when he has already fired 17 to 75% of the staff, you don't know which are the critical people. Maybe he has a good sense, but we don't know it yet. And he's too focused on cost. So I think a combination of, you know, what he wants to do in terms of the blue checks and just get the cost under control to be just too scary right now and too risky in terms of how he's going about. I love that, Karo. The data driven Mandi Singh saying, Musk is too focused on cost. I love it. But Mandi, my question for you, who or what is Twitter's competitor? Well, so that's the saving grace that they have that there isn't, you know, a Twitter like service out there. And Google probably wished they had something similar to Twitter or, you know, even a matter for that matter. Some people may argue, you know, the creators may go to Instagram.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,667,2022-11-18 22:34:18
18054," and Google probably wished they had something similar to Twitter or even meta for that matter. Some people may argue the creators may go to Instagram, it's just not saying. Twitter is the service for live events. We have a World Cup coming up and people still will engage with Twitter, but the real risk here is the service may go down because there is no one doing the basic maintenance in terms of taking care of laws and the underlying infrastructure. And I just feel like in this case, there is anything that could happen. I mean, we've seen what a lack of governance can do at a company like FTX, you know, the whole thing. We talked about it the whole of this week and there is no governance. There is no one looking at compliance and that is the risk right now with Twitter. Of course, this is now a private company so we don't try to stock. But there is a lot of key people who have put a lot of money to work alongside Elon Musk and there is also a lot of banks holding the debt. How concerned you think these people are right now? What are the fundamentals you have been looking like of a business like this? Yes, so what Musk has told us is Twitter was losing 4 million dollars a day. So that basically means that they are losing about, you know, 1.5 billion in revenue. And if you think about, you know, what he's trying to offset the layoffs is really make the Twitter company break even, you know, in terms of the fundamentals. So that should please the debt holders. But at the same time, it also shows that, you know, Twitter as a company is losing revenue. So in my mind, the fact that, you know, they are focusing that much on cost is a sign that they're already losing revenue. And I wouldn't be surprised if the revenue is down almost 20 percent, you know, like since Musk took over. All right, Bloomberg intelligence is Mandi Singh. Thank you very much. For more on what's next for Twitter, let's bring in Liz Pearl, form ahead of team community at Instagram and now consults with big tech companies in the creator economy and Liz. Welcome to the show. I want to ask you a similar thing to what I asked Mandi. Where does Twitter sit within the ecosystem of social media platforms? What is it that Twitter does and who does it appeal to? Well, you know, as you mentioned, I am someone who specializes in how young people and young communities use technology in the internet, right? And specifically how their behavior today influences and shapes what technology is going to look like. So when I hear, you know, Elon sharing his vision in pieces over the past week and part of that is potentially pay, you know, focusing on monetization of the VOLL, so putting a pay wall around Twitter. And that of course makes my brain go, oh, that's a kiss of death routines, right? And one of the problems I thought is they're not a team platform, right? Like the universal truth about social media is that adults will literally always get on the platforms that teens congregate to and teens will rarely, if ever, grow into the platforms that adults are on. So like they have a team problem as it is, even if it is like incredibly culturally relevant as a platform in a way that there are no competitors, right? Like teens are getting information from Twitter disseminated across the platforms they do use and maybe like ways they may not even realize. So cultural relevance relevance really important user base in trouble. I guess, you know, what I've learned in recent weeks, with this growth story that Musk is talking about, more users coming to the platform, is the role of the content creator, right? You know, on Instagram, TikTok, Caroline knows all about this. That platform is about the people that use it. Is Twitter about the content creators? Is it about the people using the platform? Or is it about, I mean, the alternative being like more about it, the dispensing information in real time about news? Is that the alternative? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it is, it is and can be a content creation platform. You know, on a high level when we're talking about competition, like something that I'm seeing happen, that I'm honestly like kind of excited about as we see all these really big social companies that are we framed as competitors to each other. So you put our Facebook Snapchat to talk. And we're seeing like finally, this disseminate, this sort of melting of them, like looking at them all, like they're all for everybody doing everything, all of the time, right?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,668,2022-11-18 22:38:17
18055, uh sort of the melting of them like looking at them all like they're all for everybody doing everything all of the time right not finally we're realizing and we're seeing this movement towards absolute discordant thing is that we're realizing not every platform can be for everybody all the time right we're seeing these mass layoffs on these big bets not playing out and I think it would be nice to see a future where um the platforms that survive and this is a likely future are the ones that actually like define their audience and focus on them really clearly and I think Twitter has got to leg up in that sense because it's like it's one of the platforms where it's extremely clear who uses Twitter right who gets valued from Twitter and there are you know young active we're talking about young people activists right like there are there are very specific communities for whom that actually make Twitter really really culturally relevant and if you don't have the biggest if you were advising now Elon Musk on how to make it more for content creators how to now lean in to making really unique storytelling ways in which I'm looking at my own Twitter feed right now and the amount of people who are giving me their Instagram links their TikTok links because they're worried as to where next they're going to be and be able to have these conversations in case the platform doesn't survive but if it does and if we manage to see it innovate do you want to see return to Periscope do you want to see more video products what do you want to do as someone who advises companies on attracting a team community on providing content yeah I mean it's I say like every platform the future is multi-format right like we they're used to we kind of sometimes treat social media like it's you know 2013 where each platform has a thing they're good at so like Instagram's images YouTube's video Twitter is text and you know ever that you're supposed to do a separate thing on each platform but the reality is every person's doing everything check later if you're a content creator right it's best expected to do every format and every platform so it's that's a lot and I do think like Twitter is behind in terms of the amount like the types of formats you can use if you want to go on and express yourself you're part of one of their core communities right like the video sucks it's insane the video sucks on the platform it's crazy but it does so being multi-format in like a real way catching up to everyone in that sense and then focusing in on the actual communities that that utilize their product and that are already their foundational communities would be my suggestion Liz I'm just going to follow up in terms of your moderation focus as well because of course we're hearing from Europe that they are worried about moderation in particular that they've got a different type of type of consideration there in terms of actual real rules real policy real fines for you if you don't live up to the content moderation that they want to see particularly against hate speech but how much is that something that you have to be thinking about when you're advising these companies and how much worry and reticence there is of companies at the moment aligning themselves with come with social media platforms that don't seem to care about it enough right I mean I think first of all um you well Roth who was form Twitter's former head of safety wrote an op-ed for New York Times about content moderation in Twitter that's like the mastery today that talks a lot about the fact that like outside forces really do influence and enforce in many ways like moderation on any platform you know including for example the app store but yeah different countries of different child safety laws for example so it is something you have to keep in mind and when I see news like you know hundreds or thousands of contractors being like oh from a big social media company you always I will always assume it's content moderation because right now every company outsources that and I think that you know these are vitally important jobs and I can't help but wonder how much safer and cleaner for advertisers these platforms would be if they were able to keep these teams in houses they scale right and then also like are you know be able to treat treat them regionally and globally so that's like a that's something I think about a lot and it's too bad that it's right now these teams are treated a little bit like they're expendable yeah I think a lot more to learn on the fallout there form ahead of team community at Instagram Liz Pearl thank you coming up can FTX investors get their money back we'll chat with the CEO of do not pay who's trying to do just that this is playing back,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,669,2022-11-18 22:42:30
18056," I'm making bones fill me up. What I need to learn from you guys is using Whip. What I need to do is I'm just getting it done. Beside Breaking a pensando Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank President Neil Kashkari is slamming the concept of cryptocurrencies. He says the whole idea of cryptocurrencies quote, nonsense after the implosion of FTX group revealed the industry's shortcomings. While many officials have warned about crypto risks and the need for regulation, Kashkari's comment represents one of the most, let's say forceful denunciations by a Fed policymaker. For more on the crypto fallout, let's bring in do not pay CEO Joshua Browder. His company aims to recruit losses similar to what has now happened with FTX investors as well as automate legal issues. FTX is actually one of your backers, right? So let's put that out on the table. You are working though to get investors money back. Josh, this is complicated. Walk us through it. Yeah, so they invested in us about a year ago and from a practical standpoint, it was a very small investment, but it's culturally it goes against everything we believe in. And so we're working hard to help people get money back from FTX. The most important thing to know is there's this regulation. It's called regulation E and it means that if you've deposited money in FTX through ACH direct deposit, you can actually get it back if you've deposited within the last 60 days. There's no discretion that the banks or anyone has. You can tell your bank, I want to reverse the deposit and then they can reverse it. And then what happens is FTX's payment processor is on the hook for refunding the money to you. And so we've been automating a lot of these sorts of refunds. One other type of refund you can do is if you load it up your FTX balance with a credit or debit card, you can also dispute the payment under something called the Fair Credit Billing Act. And it's the least we can do given that he was actually a small investor in our company. Talk to us about that experience, Josh, about getting funding.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,670,2022-11-18 22:47:27
18057," And it's the least we can do, given that he was actually a small investor in our company. Talk to us about that experience, Josh, about getting funding. Did anything make you think it was a miss? There were many, many things. There was a bait and switch I felt like. I had a friend introduce us and they said, FTIX would love to invest a small check in your round. And it turned out that when the documents were being circulated, they changed the name of the entity to the Alameda research. And I didn't even know what that was at the time, but I thought it was very shady that it wasn't actually FTIX investing when it was presented to us that they would be the ones investing. On top of that, I told FTIX, I think crypto as a scam, our company helps consumers fight other companies like Celsius. There's no value to crypto. And they said, no problem, we would still love to invest. Josh, Josh, Josh. Josh, Josh. Sorry, you told FTIX that you told FTIX that crypto is a scam, but you still took money from them for your business. Let's be clear about that. Yeah, I thought they could give us expertise on going after other crypto exchanges. I think the last time we spoke, we were going after Celsius, and they were very helpful there. And no one could have imagined that six months to a year later, they would be doing all of this stuff. No one could have predicted it. And I thought FTIX was one of the good ones and I was wrong. That's absolutely extraordinary. And to that end, are you getting involved in any sort of class action and you looking at any form of legal action yourself or is this more of focus on how your business can help others right now? We're just trying to help others. There are amazing lawyers working on the consumer side with class actions. There's a fund called Endwistle and Kapuchi. They were big in the Mad Off class class action and MF Global class action. And so we're sending people their way. We're working in small claims court. One area that hasn't been explored enough is going after the YouTubers. There are a lot of people in the FTIX orbit who are pushing consumers to sign up saying, this thing is totally safe. Use my referral code. And I think regulators and courts need to look into the personal finance YouTubers who ordinary people trusted with their life savings. Josh, I want to ask you about your users and customers. I appreciate there may be an element of confidentiality or privacy. But can you give us any sense of how much money people are trying to claim back and win back? What are the losses that people in the real world have suffered? On a grand scale, I think it's publicly reported to be over 10 billion. But on our end, we've helped, we have millions being processed, being refunded through the banks. So if you've lost money in FTIX, I can't stress this enough. If you direct a positive in the last 60 days, you should phone up your bank and say under Section E of the CFPB regulations, because I want a refund. And your bank can't say no. And they don't want to tell you about this, but you should definitely go that route if it's an option for you. Josh, what did you learn actually from FTIX about the ability to claw back money from other cell seists? And they're like many of which, they themselves were acting as a white knight involved in. Was it, and is it easy transparent to be able to do such? It's really not. The system is built on so much trust that consumers and regulators could never have imagined that all the money would never be there. And so in a lot of these cases, when a company declares bankruptcy, everything gets frozen as is the case with FTIX and Celsius. But there are other things you can do, like these workarounds with reversing the funds, contacting your credit card company, taking third parties to small claims court who aren't being properly held responsible. Hey Josh, if you raise money again from an outside investor, what lessons have you learned from your involvement with FTIX? I think our name and our brand is extremely important, and we should be very...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,671,2022-11-18 22:51:18
18058," Investor, what lessons have you learned from your involvement with FTX? I think our name and our brand is extremely important and we should be very careful to make sure that anyone, even if they're putting in a small check and they have no influence, we should make sure that everything is like squeaky clean. I thought that that was the case with FTX, they were investors in Sequoia, all of Silicon Valley, but in reality, all of these crypto companies had shaky foundations. Well, looking at the other backers that you have, of course, the Andresons, the founders fund, the Luxes, I mean you've taken money from standout Silicon Valley players and it's notable of the lessons now learnt, but we really thank you for your clarity and for really being so true to yourself with us, we appreciate it. Do not pay, see you, Josh Browder, stay well, meanwhile coming up, more culture clash at the World Cup in Qatar, and the first whistle that's going to be blowing your head, let's bring it back. So you're coming to the World Cup this November or December, you know Qatar is a conservative country, but you want to enjoy the sun and sand. What do you wear? The answer is complicated, country men and women mostly wear traditional dress while out and about, long white tholbs for men with a coach on their heads, women wear black robes called vayas with hijabs to cover their hair, oh and their makeup is typically flawless. But unless you wear this on a day-to-day basis, stick to your normal wardrobe with a few rules. In public places like malls and parks, both women and men are obliged to cover everything from their shoulders to their knees. It's particularly strict with women, but enforcement's not uniform, however you can be and people are kicked out of public places if they don't comply. There are two main places where this rule doesn't apply. One, the Pearl, a large residential development on artificial islands that stretches out into the Persian Gulf. It's home to lots of the white collar residents from western countries, and also luxury hotels around the country. In both places you'll see many skirts and tank tops, bikinis are standard wear at the pool. It's a clear house.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,672,2022-11-18 22:55:51
18059," For Sand Tank Top, bikinis are standard wear at the pool. It's not clear how strictly these rules are going to be enforced when more than a million fans descend on the country before the World Cup. But this is the way people dress in Qatar. And we thanks my foxman for that report. And meanwhile, Ed, Katari officials, did you see that it is all over social media? They set to ban the sale of alcohol within the World Cup stadiums. It's a dramatic reversal for an earlier decision, of course, that Anhaj Zabush in Bev was going to be selling Budweiser beer there. Bloomberg's learning that, well, it's likely going to result in moving concession stands serving the booze further away from the stadiums. And those that have shelled out thousands of dollars to private hospitality suite are apparently there unaffected, we understand. Look, the World Cup being held in Qatar has been controversial. I look across Instagram, I look across Twitter. You've got to lean in on the positive and football or soccer wherever you are in the world, it brings the world together. Beer is a key part of football culture in Europe, for example, not everywhere, but how amazing is it that the whole world is talking about football or soccer right now? So, key game for you. Well, we obviously got the kickoff on Sunday. What is it, Ecuador versus Qatar? But then when are we up next, Ed? And who are you sporting? As my finalist, no. I'm a proud Welshman. The online community, I cannot wait for Wales USA on Monday. And I hope, honestly, that Wales be England the day after Thanksgiving. I mean, there's the song. Who is it? Is it Nicki Minaj performing it? The official anthem? Yeah. Yeah? It's quite er, dates. I'd be interested in, she's going to have to be by some luxury hotels, by some sort of all. Not as good as Shakira's, not as good as Shakira's, no way. Well, football, we hope, is coming home to whomever end up winning it. I'm pretty sure we'll be supporting England and Wales.

18060,"ém The great sci-fi art of the mid-20th century teased the vision of the future with one distinct element and common, a life for humans in outer space. Whether vacationing on an exotic new planet or commuting to the moon for business, space travel seemed like it was just around the corner. If here we are, a half century later, and only about 500 human beings have ever left the bounds of Earth's atmosphere. But thanks to a set of ambitious private companies betting on the promise of space tourism, that long awaited future could be here sooner than we think. For most of the history of spaceflight, governments have been the prime force behind nearly every aspect, from planning to funding to cruise selection. But as early as the 1980s, proposals for commercial space tourism began to emerge, along with innovative solutions for getting people there, such as the wild concept of sticking a 74-person passenger cabin in the cargo bay of a NASA space shuttle. Although various non-astronauts have been selected for missions over the years, true space tourism didn't happen until 2001. When an entrepreneur named Dennis Tito coughed up an estimated $20 million to hitch a ride with the Russian Federal Space Agency for a week-long vacation aboard the International Space Station. 20 years later, we're seeing a new contender in this final frontier of tourism. It's becoming a private enterprise situation, still very high-risk with the high-reward, potential reward. But government is really out of the business of flying people now, and it's really going to be companies like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos and Richard Branson that do that heavy lifting. Commercial space tourism is usually about taking the non-astronaut, the private citizen into an orbital or suborbital flight. So you get a short amount of microgravity experience, and you can float and take some photos. And then you come back. This was something that technology had gotten to a point where the private sector was going to make a business out of this. There are multiple companies that want to get to the place where they fly people into space. The first of these is Blue Origin, founded in 2000 by Jeff Bezos. Using the autonomous rocket system New Shepard, a tribute to the first American in space, Blue Origin plans to launch up to six passengers at a time, offering a rarefied treat of 62 mile high views and a momentary experience of weightlessness. Focusing officially kicked off in May 2021, with the very first C to be auctioned off for charity.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,674,2022-11-18 23:04:37
18061," 62 mile high views and a momentary experience of weightlessness. Bokeying officially kicked off in May 2021 with the very first C to be auctioned off for charity. Meanwhile, Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic has also been pursuing a viable form of suborbital tourism. Aiming for a launch in 2022, once Sir Richard himself has taken flight. I'm hoping to be able to go to space. I'd love to be able to coincide with the moon landing and go to space. So I've got the whip on the team and we'll see how we go. The company claims to have lined up over 600 seat reservations so far, including Justin Bieber and Leonardo DiCaprio. Virgin has projected that the final cost of the ticket will be at least $250,000, or roughly $50,000 for each of the five minutes or so of weightlessness that you'll get to experience. Although costly both companies' offerings aim to make suborbital flight a regular form of adventure travel, eventually driving down costs at scale to expand the customer base beyond the orbit of celebrities and billionaires. The third major contender is Elon Musk's SpaceX, which has set its sights even higher on orbital flights, which are... It's a whole other level of complexity and energy and danger. When you go suborbital, if you're just going to go up above the von Karman line, which is 100 kilometers, or about 62 miles, you only need to get up to maybe 5,000 miles an hour to get up there and you go basically straight up and then straight back down. You don't have the reentry heating that you would see coming in from an orbital. So when you go orbital, I don't care if you're a baseball or a battleship. You've got to go 17,500 miles per hour, not just 5,000 miles an hour. The energy is involved are much greater. By doing that, SpaceX has gone another level up and that's what they're doing with the Inspiration 4. Visit Inspiration4.com for your chance to go to space. Inspiration 4 is the first planned all-civilian mission into orbit, slated to launch in late 2021. The crew will bring their own set of diverse perspectives and backgrounds and experiences to test how a group of different people, namely people who aren't professional astronauts, could affair in space. Until now, astronauts have had to be physically perfect and this mission is changing that. And so I feel incredibly honored to be representing those who aren't physically perfect. At H10, I was diagnosed with bone cancer and I was treated at St. G Children's Research Hospital. And I spent a year there undergoing intense chemo and also surgery that ultimately saved my leg. I now work at St. Goude as a PA, a physician assistant, and I work with leukemia and lymphoma patients. The kids we work with are so brave and they are very excited to watch me go to space because this is showing them that, you know, they're capable of doing this as well. Hey Lee, along with three other crew members, will spend three days in space orbiting the Earth every 90 minutes before landing back off the coast of Florida. Well, when you think about access, the first astronauts for the United States came from the test pilot side and so women weren't allowed to be a part of that. We have somebody in their 20s, somebody in their 30s, somebody in the 40s, and somebody in their 50s. And so there can be access in all kinds of way, whether you're talking about age, whether you're talking about gender, whether you're talking about race and ethnicity and all of those things. The first time, you know, people are going up into space and not sent there by super power, like the United States or Russia or China. Well, that's like really significant. And, you know, you've got to, you know, be very thoughtful about it. The whole game plan right now is to make space like really affordable and, you know, accessible for everybody. So you can have fishing buddies going to space someday, but the first is special. And so with that, we wanted to have, you know, a crew selection process that could make space available to everyday people. Getting to space is only the first step for space tourism. The next challenge is what to do, and where to stay when you get there. Axiom Space is planning to launch the first segment of a new commercial space station in 2024. Their $2 billion project called Axe Station would become the first free-flying private international space station. Or to use a more consumer friendly term, a space hotel. Axiom isn't the only company out to make your space stay a little more comfortable. Big low aerospace has been building what they call expandable habitat tech.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,675,2022-11-18 23:08:44
18062," Space Hotel. Axiom isn't the only company out to make your space stay a little more comfortable. Big low aerospace has been building what they call expandable habitat technology, like their B330, an inflatable pod module that expands once in orbit. There's even one attached to a national space station right now they've been testing it, and you take it up and it's rather small and then you inflate it and it seems to be working very, very well. This is likely to be the first kind of tourist hotel that you're going to see up in space. First of all it's easy to carry instead of this giant tin can with all of that. The inflatable is lighter, you can just blow them up and they get a nice big size for about you know half the less than half the weight probably. But even as space missions become accessible to civilians. The risks of going to space are incredibly high and you could die a thousand ways that we can think of and a thousand other ways that we can't think of. This is Michelle Hanlon. She's a space lawyer at the Mississippi School of Law focused on protecting humans in outer space. Now I'm not an attorney for any of the space tours so I haven't been privy to their private contracts but I can tell you that the FAA requires certain waivers to be in those contracts. So for example the FAA says well we're not going to make you make your spacecraft to a certain safety level. We are going to make you spacecraft operator make sure that you inform your space tours of all of the hazards that you know of that I imagine a very long waiver all the way you can die in space. And you have to understand that there's health risks and you have to indemnify the US government if you are launching the United States. So those are things that we know a space tourist has to sign and has to wait. So now let's go back and think about our space flight participants. The FAA calls space tourists space flight participants. They don't call them astronauts. Why is that important? If you're not an astronaut there's no obligation to rescue you if something goes wrong. It's a lot of money to set up a rescue launch. If it can even be done it's something really important to think about and that difference as we as we cross this threshold from having astronauts in space to having real people like me in space. And when we are able to make it to space reliably enough there's still a host of other legal and ethical issues to consider before space tourism can truly take off. There are so many gaps in space law that we are going to have to put in a lot of sort of basement ideas and so for example the outer space treaty is a treaty that offers principles and guidelines for state activities for the activities of national governments. Doesn't talk about private entities. Doesn't talk about humans in space. So now if something goes wrong so let's think about all of the times hotels on earth are sued right. So slip and false. You step on something in the bathroom. You sue the hotel and it becomes a private lawsuit. Because of the vagaries of international law if something happens in space well boy you can sue the state that launched your spacecraft. You can sue the company that brought you there. You can sue the hotel. You can sue the individual. You can sue every government related to that because the way the outer space treaty and the outer space regime have set this up is that anything that happens in space first has to go through a diplomatic channel before you think about suing in a court of law. And so every single slip and fall in a space hotel is a diplomatic nightmare. And so we really need to figure that out before we before we start sending a lot of people there. You think about human rights in space here we don't think about a human right to oxygen because it's kind of all around us and free. It's not in a space hotel. So what happens if something happens in the oxygen depletes? Who gets the oxygen first? And then of course let's not even think about the labor. How do you treat your labor in a space hotel where that person it may be there two or three years without coming back to earth? So a lot of things to think about. Space habitats are more likely in the near future to focus on research missions and be a home for experiments that can't happen as easily back on earth. Space hotels I think they garner a lot of headlines and a lot of news. But at the same time that's not the first thing that you're going to see happen. They don't offer the compelling business case. I think that you'll see from a place that wants to manufacture pharmaceuticals or a new type of crystal or...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,676,2022-11-18 23:12:58
18063," They don't offer the compelling business case, I think, that you'll see from a place that wants to manufacture pharmaceuticals or a new type of crystal or some type of filament or fiber optic cables and other things that you can do in microgravity. The things that are actually a high value finished good, when you get that back to earth and you sell it for a very, very huge profit margin. That's what's likely to happen in space as opposed to having a real estate platform that you sell to a tourist, a space hotel. It's really interesting and it will probably happen, but it's not likely to be at the forefront of space commerce. Even if space hotels are right around the corner, don't get too excited about booking a trip in one. It's not a cheap ticket to ride to space and it's going to be millionaires and billionaires and that sort. But at the same time, the point was made that in the early days of airline trips, that was also a completely unaffordable ticket for most people. Those people who flew were people of means and over time it becomes affordable to the masses. And I think that's the goal for all the entrepreneurs in space as well to get those costs down to a point where it's not $10 million or $5 million or $300,000 right into sub-orbital space. When it becomes more like buying a first-class ticket to go to Europe from the United States. So that's the goal and the question is, can we get to that point? Given the immense operating costs of getting to space, it may be years, if ever, until space tours and becomes a profitable venture for any of these companies. Virgin Galactic, the only publicly traded company of the three, has had a particularly rocky year, initially riding on the momentum of a SPAC deal. But more recently beset by launch delays and major funders including Branson himself selling large quantities of their stock in the company. Space is really, really, really hard and it's an absolutely shay, but it's one that happens to be very true. It's just really hard to do. That's also the reason that you've seen the delays that Virgin had talked about flying years and years ago. And it became such a crazy point that Richard Branson actually stopped talking about it when he was asked because it was never going to be when he predicted. But it's not insurmountable and you know, investors have stepped up because this is something that is doable. Despite the astronomical dangers and costs of getting to space, it may ultimately follow the course of other once fanciful modes of travel. Right brothers, having, you know, what was by modern standards of very unimpressive first flight, you know, at Kitty Hawk, I mean, you know, you had like less than 20 years later, you had your first airborne ambulances being used to save lives fundamentally the world is a more interesting place when people can go and dance among the stars and such. The lure of space is in a, it's in our DNA. It's that exploration bug. We are an exploratory species and we want to go out there and see what's out there. The vision that I had in 1969 of seeing normal human beings traveling the space, it's finally beginning to happen. When you get a bunch of people up there and they can all see it for themselves, that will create even get another revolution in how we treat our planet and what we think about. So while 2001 came and went without quite looking like Stanley Kubrick's ultimate space fantasy, 2021 might finally be the year we're catching up.

Or the bizarre two-foot towers of Mono Lake. And true to California's boom and bust spirit, you can santa around the ghost town of Bodhi. What a novel experience to find an empty American city where all the businesses are shut down. To do 395 upright, it helps to have a guide. And mine is a man named Jan. And his crew, Aaron. Let's take a look. Ten lemmy, the hardest partying dog of all time. Jan agreed to show me some of what 395 has to offer. But only if we agreed not to disclose any locations. My name is Jan Svorestra. I'm an industrial designer out of LA. And I spend a lot of time camping and a lot of time in the Eastern Sierra. It's a place I love. And sometimes I'm known as 395 North because this is my Instagram account. And I don't like to be known as that, but I'm trying to use it to set a good example and do more with it than just social media. Waited we had a cab, but we got here laylize. I was sure we were. This is BLM land right on the outskirts of National Forest. And it's one of my favorite places in the world. Basically, everything outdoors wrapped into one. Do you think about California, man? Oh, man. We have so much National Forest in public land that you can literally just cruise out and find a place to camp. It's ours. What I wish was mine is Jan's sweet truck. It's a 2019 Ford Ranger.

When you find the super special beautiful spots is that you bustin' out a map and like, looking where it might be cool to go or is it worth a mouth and just getting to know people of the locals.

Now I've realized that you can't fight it. The internet has just shrunk the world. So, we're not gonna stop it. We're not gonna stop people from going there. So, I'm a lot more focused in conversation now with trying to set a good example. When you go, pick up your trash. When you're poopin' out in the wilderness, don't leave your toilet paper on the top.

18066," The downside was breathing. A man David here suggested that we try and outflank the smoke by cutting through your 70. Without a reservation, we had to talk our way in. Uh, yes, no stopping, no getting out. And... You don't want to go out? Yeah, no problem. We just wanted to get through. It was a beautiful choice. I'd regard that as a smoke. Oh, whoa! Hey! But not quite as effective as we had hoped. Fast forward four hours or so, and we had managed to trade the smokey majesty of Yosemite for the smokey... Um... Look at it. Stripmalls of the Central Valley. We have made it sort of out of the smoke all the way across Yosemite National Park and here to the gorgeous Central Valley of California. We're off to see a kind of surprising tech startup that is making some pretty strange machines to serve all the growers out in this region. And where we're to wear here and this near Fresno, this is California Farm Country, right? We're just out the Fresno town called Kingsburg, so we're right in the Central Valley of California. Very, very large farming valley here. It's kind of considered the bread basket of the world. The Central Valley stretches out over about 20,000 square miles and the farmers here produce about one-fourth of the food that Americans eat, including a whole lot of fruits and nuts. Tell me a little bit of the background of God's. I know some of this is like a family business. The roots of this go back a ways. Tell me kind of like how we got... So it was essentially like a startup, I guess. Yeah, definitely. So the founder of our company is Dave Crinklaw and he started the business back in 1982. He started with this basically with his dad was commercial spraying of trees and vineyards. Got to the point where our biggest challenge was labor. Just the shortage of it really. He was forced into innovating and he had had this idea for quite some time about doing a driverless sprayer and finally got to the point where he said, you know what, I either got to get out of this business or I'm going to innovate. Ordannaker Knot crops need to be sprayed and this process has to take place a few times a year. This means hiring a lot of people to work long hours under serious pressure. And so, just like the tech bros to the north, Gus decided to solve all of its problems with robots. On this like labor points, you guys have set this up where you can have somebody in a truck and that one person can monitor I think like eight of these. In order to operate Gus, you have one guy or girl that sits in a pickup and they monitor from a laptop computer. So that person is basically just watching all the vehicles on the screen. They can monitor up to eight of them at a time while they're out there spraying an orchard. And so that user interface really provides them with all the information they need to make sure that the machines are safe and that they're doing the correct job. So it tells them what speed they're driving, the engine RPM, the amount of gallonage per acre that they're applying at any given time. So if any one of the machines has an issue, it's going to send an alert to that laptop. Much like a self-driving car, these beasts use GPS, LiDAR, and cameras to see and navigate the world around them. They also rely on pre-built maps of the orchards for extra guidance. Gus builds the machines right here and then takes them out for robot training on this orchard next door. It's here that the company learns if the machines will behave and do as their software and human masters command. So this...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,680,2022-11-18 23:30:15
18067," in this orchard next door. It's here that the company learns if the machines will behave and do as their software and human master's command. So this is kind of like the, this is a test orchard where you guys put it through the paces and work on the technology. Yeah, so this is our test orchard right here. It's right by our building and so you can see in the background. So every new machine as it comes off the assembly line, it's put through a commissioning test right here. We test all the sensors on the machine, autonomous computer, all the safety systems, make sure it's doing what it's doing prior to when it's delivered to a customer. So what's it doing now? So right now he's doing a test spray. So he's just turning the water on to make sure that the system comes up to pressure, spraying water out of the nozzle is just to make sure it's all functioning properly. Okay. He's got like a crazy turbine at the backer. Yeah, so it's basically just a big fan. Okay. And that fan's driven off of the Cummins diesel motor and it just basically creates a big air flow. Gus is already selling these vehicles to brave modern farmers and people the world over have taken notice of its machines. And have you just sold them in the central valley or like throughout the US or even overseas or where they go? Yeah, so right now the majority of our machines are here in California in the central valley. However, we do have machines and customers in Florida and the citrus industry over there as well as Australia. And I think you start selling them in like December of 2019. Yeah, so we started taking orders early last year for the sprayers and the first delivery we made were in December of 2019. Okay. And how much do they cost each? So our retail price on these machines is $285,000. So it's like it's not a small investment, but I'm sure the regular sprayers aren't. Yeah, I mean, we're honestly not too far away from conventional equipment on our price. And the main thing is that the return on investment is very, very quick due to all the labor savings and the increased efficiency. I mean, these machines, they just thrive. But basically what we're doing besides this machine, this is our first machine we call it orchard Gus, mainly designed for your nut trees as well as citrus and fruit. In the future, we're working on a few other projects. We're gonna do more machines. One of them is actually a vineyard sprayer. So vineyards are much tighter spacing. So the machine has to be physically smaller. And then we've got our eyes on doing a lot of other innovating. That right there, friends, is a central valley farmer putting his whole fruit basket on the table. Gary's TED Talk can't be far off. And with that, it was time to get back in the RV. And to confront what happens when three men are bested by their own failings and the forces of entropy. Next on Hello World, we cruise into the Mojave Desert in search of a lunar lander. We have instruments that we are going to deliver to the South Pole of the Moon in December 2022. Instruments that are trying to scan the surface of the Moon. And hang with a test pilot who walked away from this. Meet Betty. She lives by herself. But for the last few months, she hasn't been alone. Ella Kew, tell me a joke. Did you hear about the claustrophobic castor-n-lot? No. Apparently, he just needed a little space.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,681,2022-11-18 23:34:37
18068," Do you know who? Tell me a joke. Did you hear about the claustrophobic gastronolot? No. Apparently, he just needed a little space. Most technology isn't made for 93-year-olds. But this woman is making sure that this particular robot is. I like you. Who are you? She's researching the way we interact with machines. And if she has her way, robots will soon be a trusted companion for all of us. My name is Ella Q. How can I help you? As technology replaces old jobs, it's also creating new ones. I'm Aki Ito and I'm here to show you the jobs of the future. My name is Danielle A. Shach and I am a human robot interaction researcher. It's really hard to intuitively design a robot meant for a consumer audience. You have to make sure that it's a robot that people want. People know how to use and people value. Danielle works for an Israeli startup called Intuition Robotics. Its US office is here in downtown San Francisco. Hello. Hey Danielle, it's Aki. Come on in. The company is funded by a couple big names like Samsung and Toyota. Full disclosure, Bloomberg's venture capital arm is an investor too. This is Ella Q. Can I take her out for a spin? Please? Ella Q. Tell me what you can do. I am a proactive social robot designed for older adults. I can connect you to your family and friends and even play music. These features might remind you of the Amazon Echo, but you'd be missing the point if you compared her to a smart speaker. She's not meant to just be useful. She's meant to be a companion. Why don't you take a break and have a drink? And that's why she has a head that can nod and make other subtle gestures you might expect from a pet. Through our research with older adults, we're finding that almost on a daily basis. We see that somebody tells her that they love her or that they like her. Or that they miss her. Literally, I love you. They'll also tell her I'm depressed or I'm lonely. They'll open up to her in a way that they might not necessarily open up to a human because they don't feel like they'll be judged. Ella Q. Is it on sale yet? But a prototype is already in the homes of about a dozen early testers who live in the Bay Area. Ella Q. Tell me what the weather is today. Danielle's job is to figure out what's working and what's not. Sorry. Please rephrase your request. And she does that by visiting each of her testers twice a month. How important are these visits to your job? They're critical. We're building a product for people who we are not. I'm not a senior. And how could you know how to design for somebody if you don't do research? Because otherwise you would just be designing in the dark. Jobs like Danielle's are just starting to emerge. Until recently, robots were mostly in factories separated from humans. But now they're finally getting cheap enough, small enough, and smart enough to be in our homes. This has created a whole new challenge of designing robots that people will actually want to interact with. And that's where Danielle comes in. Her research has helped shape every little facet of Ella Q. From the way Ella Q moves to the way she talks. It's a very special job and it can be really hard and it can be...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,682,2022-11-18 23:38:51
18069," Help shape every little facet of L.A.Q. From the way L.A.Q moves to the way she talks. It's a very special job, and it can be really hard, and it can be really frustrating about that end of the day. It's incredibly rewarding. And I think the most rewarding part about it is when I see the joy on the user's faces, like that they saw their feedback turned into something real. Today, we've driven east of San Francisco to go see one of Danielle's research participants. L.A.Q. Tell me something interesting. Did you know that Ronald Reagan was a lifeguard in high school and save 77 people's lives? Now, see, this is where a conversation is. She should open up, and I should say, no, I did not know that. I expect her to be able to continue a conversation for at least a couple of comments. Yeah. And why is that? Why? Yeah. Because that's companionship. When Betty was around Danielle's age, she was working with some of history's very first computers. When I was finishing up my master's degree, I was working at Harvard in the computer lab when they were building Mark IV. A large room size computer. But now, this artificial intelligence stuff is amazing. L.A.Q. Yes. Schedule a doctor's appointment. No problem. I'm working on it. When Danielle brought along the idea of working with robotics for the elderly, I said, are you kidding me? Will older people connect to a robot? And she said, I don't know. Let's research and find out. LAUGHTER Danielle grew up here in this suburb of Atlanta. Her parents spent much of their childhoods in Israel and met in the US. We as immigrants, we understood that we might need to work a little harder. In fact, I feel that rather than taking away from Danielle, it gave her so much more. Because she understood the fact that you need to run after your dreams and work really hard, no matter what the challenges are. School didn't come easily for Danielle. I have dyslexia and that very much affected my self-esteem academically. The principal of the school did not recommend her to take the entrance classes. She fought for it and she got into it and she did very well with them too. Danielle's first job out of grad school was at X, the secretive research facility founded by Google. It's known for dreaming about kinds of wacky, far-flying ideas. Can you tell us about the moonshot she worked on? No, I can't tell you too much about the projects that I worked on. I can't say that I was working on robotics. She loved the job, but wanted to work on something that would reach real consumers sooner. So she left X after a year and joined intuition robotics. She's been working in the field for four years now and it took her a while to find her footing in a male-dominated industry. I've gone to different meetups where we'll be like circle of men with their zip up jacket with their company logo on it and a beer in their hand. And I'll come in with lipstick and nobody wants to talk to me. This is my closet. So at first she did her best to fit in, wearing a pair of glasses she didn't need, and toning down her style. So what's the kind of thing you used to wear to a conference? Stuff like this. Cloudy things. Let me keep it like you're 40.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,683,2022-11-18 23:43:14
18070," and toning down her style. So what's the kind of thing you used to wear to a conference? Stuff like this, blousey things. That make you look like you're 40. But that got old after a while. And what's the kind of thing you wear now? No, it's like I just enjoy being kind of expressive and playful and what I wear. Before we wrap up for the day, Danielle has one more LEQ tester to visit. Joseph is 97. And he's had the robot in his home for eight months. How are you? I'm fine. How are you? Good. How has Miss LEQ been? She always tells me to take a drink of water at least four times a day. So we added a whole bunch of new facts to LEQ. Did you know that a cup of chopped red bell pepper contains more vitamin C than an orange? Okay. What did you think of that? The present was, I could see that quite clearly. What about this? Well, I can see that. LEQ, play music. No problem. It will begin shortly. By 2050, almost half a billion people are going to be 80 or older. And if current trends continue, more and more are going to be like Joseph and Betty, living alone. LEQ, stop. Today, both of them are doing okay. But some of Danielle's other participants have been struggling. Is it kind of hard to leave them at the end of the day? It is. Some of our testers are pretty advanced in the stages of depression through loneliness and isolation. And at times, I know that LEQ is cheering them up in their day. But I know that it's only part of the way. No source of artificial intelligence robots will ever be able to replace humans and human companionship or human care. The key to Danielle's work is to embrace that very limitation of machines. Robots should help humans do what they love, help humans interact with more humans, help humans in general. Not pull humans away from humans. Not take humans jobs, leave humans without purpose. Whether it's in our workplaces or in our homes, robots are soon going to be everywhere. And it's up to Danielle to make sure this robot-filled future leaves us just a little better off. So don't be afraid. And if you are afraid, come and join us. Because I promise it's a friendly place. And I promise it's a friendly place. And I promise it's a friendly place.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,684,2022-11-18 23:47:27
18071," If you're like the estimated 74% of adults in the US who use YouTube, this might be what your home screen looks like. An algorithmically curated look into what you like to watch. See some tips on how to prepare a new meal or your favorite vloggers latest video. But if you're a parent who shares your phone with your children, it probably looks a little more like this. Kids content on YouTube is huge. Views for videos can reach into the billions. Five of the top 10 videos in all of YouTube's history are either music videos or kids videos, with baby shark having more views than people on the planet. YouTube has created a revolution, not an evolution, in the way kids and families consume video content. And that extends then into how they view toys and play and all of the associated things that go with that. Kids YouTube for the unaware can be adorable. It can also just be flat out strange. But often it involves toys. And for toy makers who embrace the platform, it led to record success. And I think it was surprised on question, it was the biggest phenomenon that has ever happened in toy industry. This is the story of how YouTube changed kids toys. Play patterns, the way children play is timeless. But how we deliver on those play patterns through product and how we market that to children has changed quite a bit over the years. And I would say that the last five to ten years really ranks right up there with the 1950s when TV commercials directed to children, the first launched by Mattel. This is Nancy's Wears. She led the Barbie brand during the 90s and spent four years as the chief marketing officer for Spin Master. It used to be that there would be a few play things that parents would bring into the home where that children would create themselves like a stick and a ball becomes a play thing. And the industry was at a certain level of volume at that point. Mattel was very innovative and actually put the first product on TV and advertised it to children. Let's play home. This created a huge explosion in the toy industry that unfolded across decades. The hit of the day when you're ready to play. Everyone knows this thing. Here he comes. Here he comes. Great as tall you ever been. And his name is Mr. Machine. Here I go. Here I go. Fighting man for it to go on the land of the T.M. Be there. When you go back to the 1980s, what do you think of in terms of hit shows? You think of things like Masters as a universe. You think of the original Transformers and Care Bears. The joke was they were 22-minute commercials. Just close your eyes and care. Let's make a TV show which is really promotion for our property or IP to help sell toys. There were a lot of those famous characters in which kids absolutely loved it. They were totally entertained but there were huge toy lines behind them. This is Jim Silver, a 37-year veteran of the toys industry. In 1999 he started a consumer toy review magazine called Toy Wishes. And now he's the CEO of an influencer talent management group, TTPM. Regulations changed through the years and also parents became aware that they were purely commercials. And you saw a lot of the new channels, the Disney Channel and Nickelodeon. They realized that wouldn't work anymore. And to them, entertainment came before licensing. What happened over time was that toy started to become...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,685,2022-11-18 23:51:54
18072," Happened over time was that toys started to become designed for a 30-second commercial. Closed it's a mild matter toolbox open it's a micro machine USA. Cruiser mini micro machine vehicles planes opposed to the police station the marine of the mini motorcycle repair shop the gas station the construction office work the real working drubberage highway passenger rap and garage doors. So if you couldn't explain it in a 30-second commercial cost reduce it out of the product and just stick with you know what you could say and features of toys magical features using electronics lights and sounds and mechanical movements that magic like they don't know how it happens that became more and more important. The sound of power is heard. Fire! Batman! See ya Batman. That man's turbo powered that mobile flies into high gear. Since 2000 with cable channels dedicated to kids, Disney Channel, Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network there became the opportunity to reach kids and mass numbers every day of the week and so the toy industry's continued to grow. The toy industry for the most part was a pretty solid business just you know growing a couple percent a year here and there. There'd be big big years here and there when there's maybe a hit movie like a Star Wars movie come out you know drive a lot of toy sales. From 2014 to 2019 the global toy industry would grow by 15 percent and about the same time those major cable networks of Nickelodeon, Disney Channel and Cartoon Network would lose half their total audience. 2017 also saw the bankruptcy of Toys R Us as both parents and kids discovered and bought more toys online. If you think about kids they're usually the first adopters of a new medium. Kids weren't watching things like Nickelodeon as much as they used to. They were watching things on YouTube. YouTube started in early 2005 and this was like you know the very early web 2.0 this beginning of sort of like what was the time was going to be a huge or a generated content. Like web blogging was a big my space was the biggest thing on the internet back then there was an early video of a Brazilian soccer legend doing stunt tricks that just when it exploded on the site one of the first viral videos lazy Sunday if you remember that SNL short. That's the chronic life of Killsonania! Oh Charlie! I'm done he bit me. I remember those early viral hits. YouTube in the early days was definitely comedy and music. It was a place of experimentation. I was the chief audience officer at Maker Studios. I oversaw essentially the creator partnerships and all over the world. Maker Studios was one of the largest multi channel networks on YouTube and had partnered with some of the biggest YouTube channels of the time before being sold to Disney in 2014. Chris is now the CEO of Pocketwatch which represents some of the largest kids stars on YouTube including Ryan's world and Love Diana who can amass over a couple billion views every month. The truth is one of the very biggest and earliest videos on all of YouTube is by a creator and star named I Justine where she unboxed her first mobile phone bill for her brand new iPhone and it came in a box. And this ultimately morphed into many different formats associated with unboxing and tech was actually really big. And those became fairly successful pretty early on on the platform and you saw them expand from tech products to beauty products and then around 2012 and 2013 which was on this explosion in the toys. So here's the Furby inside right here. We used to call them hands channels and a hands channel was literally a top-down view of someone's hands unboxing typically a toy and they'd unbox it. They'd show each component. We just got Uncle Screamy. I would speak to many of those creators. We signed many of those creators at Maker Studios to be our partners. And it was fascinating in that it was this whole new genre.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,686,2022-11-18 23:56:13
