19058," And LOL was made by this company called MGA. Back then, you know, 2016, they were small players in the toy industry. Founded by this guy named Isaac Larian, he's the CEO and founder. I have three adult kids and they were making fun of me that, oh you're old, you don't know anything about what's happening in today's sink. And I said, like what? And they said, for example, that is, do you know about this iPhone unboxing videos that get millions and millions of views? So I thought they're pulling my leg. Children do to make fun of their parents. And then I did go and look one night and I was frankly shocked and flabbergasted that why would anybody buy an iPhone, take it home and open the box and show it on the camera and everybody would go and watch it. So I typed toy on boxing and my god, I saw so many different videos and people, kids and adults buying toys like an apple and unboxing it and video and posting it. So that gave me an idea that why not come up with the ultimate and that's the first LOL surprise. All right, oh yes, we've got a goal goal. LOL changed the way you open with toys and everybody saw that and the packaging became part of the play which became part of the entertainment. So normally if you get a package that you just open a package you take the toy out, that's not exciting. You open up LOL, you peel it away, you open up inside, you have seven surprises. And it took off like wildfire and quickly became the top toy in the country. By December of 2018, eight of the top ten toys sold were all LOL surprise brand. And according to MGA from 2016 to 2020, LOL would generate over $10 billion in retail sales worldwide. You know, LOL was bigger than Star Wars, it's bigger than Marvel, it's bigger than Barbie. These brands with huge advertising budgets are known basically by everyone. You don't have to figure out what Marvel are or Star Wars is. And LOL eclipse them all. In the toy world, blind bag or blind box toys have been growing in popularity. The most famous example in recent years is Pokemon cards, where you open packs in hopes of getting a Charizard but more often wind up with something common like Blagar here. Two years before the launch of LOL in 2014, the Australian toy company Moose Toys launched a blind bag collectible called Shopkins. And in 2016, Spin Master would launch a more expensive blind box toy it called Hatchimals. But the thing that sets LOL surprise apart is that it mainly focused on YouTube. And not putting ads on YouTube, but working with creators and influencers to get their products in the hands of these kids doing the unboxing videos. For MGA actually, the move towards YouTube was kind of a bit lucky and almost out of necessity. In late 2015, Nickelodeon parent company Viacom would sue MGA for breach of contract after it failed to pay $3.5 million for the production of a TV series based on their Lala loopsy dolls. They tried to flex their muscle and they said, well, if you don't agree to our way of seeing things in the conflict that we had, they said that conflict, we are going to stop your advertisement of toys. At the time, Nickelodeon was the number one ranked children's network and not to be able to advertise that Nickelodeon could have been a death now. But MGA, necessity is the mother of invention, that caused them to lean into digital advertising far more than any big brand had ever done before because they had to. They had to find a new way to reach kids. The court would ultimately rule in favor of Viacom. Both in LA federal court and on appeal in the 9th Circuit, Larry and Blaine, the court defeat on what he contends was judicial bias. Nickelodeon parent company Viacom didn't respond to a request for comment. So dad buys their forces to go and say, okay, they had with Nickelodeon, let's find another way to reach children.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1672,2022-11-22 00:02:45
19059," So that by itself forces us to go and say, okay, they help with Nickelodeon. Let's find another way to reach to children. And that's how we went and doubled up on YouTube especially and the rest as they say. So early on, MGA partnered with YouTube creators with huge audiences like Cookie Swirl-C. Good morning, Chocolatey Chippy Cookies. We are going to be spending the morning with this LOL Surprise Baby Fancy. They took it another step further. They actually helped kids learn how to do their own unboxing videos. They gave them support and learning and tools. And so all these kids got to be kind of a little many influencer themselves as they were unboxing their LOL products. So just to give you a flavor of how popular these videos are, go onto YouTube and search LOL Surprise. And you'll see videos with a million views, 10 million, 25 million, 50 million, and even 100 million. There's a lot of them and kids are watching these videos and they're probably watching them over and over again. The old way toy manufacturers would do things is they buy TV which was about 90% of their ad spend. And then traditional PR get on the big morning shows. It's an entirely different formula. It's much harder for toy companies right now because the formula is so complicated you have to really take a deep dive into each platform. Am I promoting on Twitter? Am I promoting on Instagram? Am I promoting on TikTok? What am I doing on YouTube? You have to look at every possible social channel. By 2017, big toy brands like Mattel had shifted nearly 50% of their marketing budget to social platform advertising. Brands would help seed videos of their toys. And if they were lucky, that could kick off a wave of creators making their own content around the product. In 2020 alone, tubular labs estimated that LOL related content had amassed 5.1 billion views. This idea of imitation. So when you see kids playing with product, it kind of excites the same neurons in your brain that happen when you do it yourself. The more we could show children having this experience, the more kids felt what it would be like to have it and then wanted to experience it themselves. In one of the criticisms of this whole influencer movement among kids is that kids are young. They don't understand what's necessarily an advertisement versus real content. And that's a big criticism of this industry is that a lot of kids are getting on YouTube at young ages not being supervised by their parents and just watching these videos. And they don't realize that maybe that influencer is getting paid by the brand to do that video or there's some other compensation. And that, you know, blurs the lines for kids is sort of developing and figuring out how to consume media. Questionable advertising concerns aside, kids YouTube creators would take off. Channels like Ryan's world would grow to almost 30 million subscribers and a whole industry formed around them. When we first started working with influencers, they were very happy to work for free product. You give them the product and they do something for you. And gradually influencers got smarter and started, you know, charging for their services as they started building a following. Now, because it is such a big business, the dollars can be significant investing in big influencers. When Spin Master launched one of its new TV series and associated product.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1673,2022-11-22 00:07:08
19060," can be significant investing in big influencers. When Spin Master launched one of its new TV series and associated product, we made it a point to buy an advertising package with Ryan's world to ensure that we could get really quick, big reach right away. This is an advertisement for Spin Master. So from these unboxing videos, the content's gotten a lot more sophisticated. They're creating narratives around the toys, voices, meta-universes, if you will. And it's really engaging content, even more so than the original unboxing videos for these kids. And the content's coming out maybe once a week, or even daily. So if you think about it, what they've done is they've created basically like a TV show around a toy. It's not unlike what we saw back in the 80s, which was criticized back then, by the way. When you've had toys like GI Joe turn into an animated series, or Masters of the Universe, or Transformers. So we've kind of seen this full circle now, right? So back to where we were, content and basically many television shows created around toys on YouTube. Kids content on YouTube is likely to face increased regulation in the coming years. In 2019, the company would agree on a $170 million settlement with the FTC for serving ads based on personal data to kids on YouTube. YouTube would put more emphasis behind its Made For Kids platform YouTube Kids, and each video uploaded to YouTube must be flagged as either made for kids or not. In a statement outlining changes to the site, YouTube would say that responsibility is our number one priority at YouTube. And this includes protecting kids and their privacy. Still, the site is far less regulated than traditional television. I do think parents have a better understanding of YouTube now, and the new genres and formats there that they didn't prior. And they now notice things like, their kid isn't watching a toy unboxing that's a commercial for a toy. Their kid is watching other kids play with toys in an imaginative way, which inspires them to go play with things in the real world in an imaginative way. In just a few short years, YouTube had caused a transfer of power from toy and network executives to nine-year-olds and their families. The Kaji family may have started out as toy reviewers, but now Ryan has launched his own line of toys, a cartoon series. He was even a blimp in the 2020 Macy's Thanksgiving parade. You and I might think about Spider-Man or Snoopy, but today's kids see that blimp of Ryan and they relate to him. He's the character they want to grow up with. He's the character they want to engage with. And as we go forward, these influencers are becoming more and more like big, giant, global brands. And that has profound effects for entertainment going forward. AirBnB is huge today. On any given night, you could have as many as two million people staying in an AirBnB all around the world. You know, our mission is that everyone can belong anywhere. We're talking, you know, 300 million stays on any average year and there's tyranny in numbers. The vast majority of AirBnB stays don't result in a safety incident, but sometimes things go wrong.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1674,2022-11-22 00:11:32
19061," The vast majority of Airbnb stays don't result in a safety incident, but sometimes things go wrong. And for Airbnb, we're talking thousands of safety incidents that occur every year that the company has to handle and has to respond to. I'm talking situations like kidnathings, hostage cases. We're talking murder, we're talking rape. We're talking, you know, the worst violent crimes that occur in our society, happen inside Airbnb's. Airbnb never wants these kinds of cases to end up in the headlines. You know, that's really bad for their brand, their reputation and their public image, particularly because this is a business that's based on strangers trusting one another. So when crimes like this occur, that kind of threatens their entire business model. I'm Olivia Carville, I'm a reporter on Bloomberg's technology team, and I've been covering online travel companies like Airbnb for the last two years. Airbnb is a startup that's based in Silicon Valley, and like many of the sharing economy startups, it managed to grow so big, so fast by essentially skirting regulations. It was based on that premise of move fast and break things, and it wanted to work against regulations in order to grow as big as possible and win the popular vote, because it became so popular, so fast that cities could no longer control it. An epique night was past August. We had one million people from around the world coming from 180 countries in a single night, staying in an Airbnb home. The vast majority of Airbnb stays, we're talking, you know, two million people staying in an Airbnb on any given night don't result in a safety incident, but sometimes things go wrong. And for the company, you know, it was dealing with these cases was a really challenging, difficult, complicated area. You had hosts and guests, and sometimes they disagreed on what happened. You had regulatory issues in some of their biggest cities, then you also had, you know, the growth of the platform and the fact that if you're going to try and prevent some of these incidents, it could cut into revenue and cut into the number of listings that you have. So for Airbnb, it was about trying to figure out the best way to handle these crises in a way that's going to not only protect the individual in crisis, but also protect the company's public image, its brand, its reputation, which is essentially what its business is based upon. As Airbnb grew, like way too big for them to be able to take all these calls alone, they developed a team of 100 highly specialized agents that handled the worst of the worst cases. Over the course of my reporting, I've talked to almost 50 former employees at Addyrbmb, and you know, seven or eight of those work directly on this elite unit. These safety agents, many of them come from military backgrounds or trauma backgrounds, they're trained to handle traumatic situations and to try and, you know, help people who are going through what may be, you know, the worst day in their lives. For these safety agents, a lot of them understood that they had a dual role. First and foremost, they wanted to protect the user in crisis, but they also knew they had a responsibility to protect the company's brand and public image. I mean, everything about housing in New York is a total mess and it's always chaotic. It's not too surprising that Airbnb's biggest battle has broken out here. 2015 was a really challenging year for Airbnb. Airbnb's listings between 2010 and 2014 were essentially illegal hotels. You know, the company was seven years old now. It had grown huge. It was now a household name. But by growing that big that fast, they also came up against, you know, a pushback in regulations. Now, Airbnb's under attack in a lot of measures. What are they saying about that? They can't give up on New York because New York's...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1675,2022-11-22 00:15:48
19062," came up against, you know, a pushback in regulations. Now, Airbubes under attack and a lot of men are still... Yeah, so what are they saying about this? They are... Well, they can't give up on New York because New York's too important for every kind of reason. They knew that they couldn't lose the battle in New York because it was one of their biggest markets, and also it could result in a domino effect. If other cities around America saw New York City either backing down on regulations or enforcing stricter regulations that could in turn be rolled out right across the country. I think it's going to be awkward when they have to, you know, put in their perspectives, their risk factors when they have to say, well, you know, one risk is that the whole thing might be somewhat illegal in our biggest market. And in December of that year, a young woman from Australia flew into New York and stayed in an Airbmb with a group of her friends. They picked up a key from the local corner bodega without even needing identification. The police report said this 29-year-old woman left her friends at a midtown bar and returned to the Airbmb on her own. She thought that she was alone, but she wasn't. There was a man inside the apartment hiding in the shadows with a kitchen knife. He grabbed her, dragged her into a room, and raped her. He laid a fled. About an hour after this attack, he came back and police were in the apartment at the time. They opened his backpack and found three items of interest. The kitchen knife, one of the woman's earrings, and a set of keys to the Airbmb. This case was a really complicated one for Airbmb, partly because it occurred in New York City, where they were fighting this really tough battle with city officials over regulations, and partly because the alleged rapist had the keys and he was inside the apartment. That meant that Airbmb needed to do what it could to protect itself. They wanted to find out, you know, how did he get the keys? That was a really big question for them. They launched an investigation to find that out. But before they did anything like that, before they thought to kind of protect their own reputation here, they really focused on doing what they could to help this young woman. They paid for her to move to a hotel. They paid for her mother to fly in from Australia. They paid for both of them to fly home. They offered to cover any health or or counseling costs that she might need later. But inside the company internally, they also launched an investigation. They wanted to know how did the alleged rapist get the keys? How did he get inside that Airbmb? And when they found out that the keys had been left at the corner of Odaiga, that then created, you know, a problem of liability for Airbmb. They didn't have a policy around key exchange. They didn't tell their hosts how they did or didn't have to hand keys over to guests as they were arriving. So for Airbmb, they also, you know, they wanted to know what was going to be said in court. They wanted to know if any media were going to pick up on this story. And they wanted to know what their legal liability potentially could be. A week later, the alleged rapist was indicted in the Supreme Court in New York. An Airbmb sent a staff member to find out if the company was going to be mentioned in any of the court records. And it wasn't. It wasn't mentioned in the police report. It wasn't mentioned by prosecutors. There's no mention of Airbmb really in any public record. This case has never been reported until now. And, you know, for Airbmb, that was kind of lucky. This case never landed in the media. And, you know, 18 months later, when this woman's lawyer reached out to the company, they signed a settlement for $7 million. And part of that settlement, there's a clause that says she cannot assert or imply responsibility on the part of the company. We've spoken to legal experts who indicate that what this really did is gag the woman from saying, I blame Airbmb.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1676,2022-11-22 00:20:07
19063," We've spoken to legal experts who indicate that what this really did is gag the woman from saying, I blame Airbnb. Airbnb is one of the few companies in the world that has this like online offline kind of hybrid situation. Where you have users who meet online and then actually meet in the offline world and stay under the same roof. And that means that the company at the end of the day really has to take more responsibility than other social media platforms might do. With Airbnb's terms of service, that really means that whenever there's a dispute between hosts and guests and the company, this is all handled behind closed doors in arbitration. Most of these cases don't even make it to the courtroom. And when they do, the company will settle them so it doesn't go on through the courts. And what that means is that there hasn't really been a legal precedent that's set to determine what your Airbnb's liability is here. You know, is it really responsible for when things go wrong inside its listings? What I learned over the course of my reporting is that this is anything but simple. This is a complicated, nuanced area. There are difficult trade-offs here. The company also has to have hard, you know, tough conversations about policy. Airbnb's business model is based on strangers trusting one another. We often hear from the founders and the chief executive himself saying, trust is their number one priority. I've actually heard Brian Cheske, the chief executive of Airbnb, talking about how he didn't build a website or a platform that allows people to stay in each other's homes, what he built was a community that trusts one another. And when that premise is undercut, Airbnb's entire business model is under threat. It sounds far-fetched at the moment, doesn't it? But you know, we may be seeing ads like this in the not-too-distant future. Living away from Earth has always captured our imagination. As well as providing the basics for survival, these ideas are a symbol of humankind's unique creativity and ambition. This advanced beast or a species station will be hit quadrace for the final cent of the moon. Today, the idea of multiple outposts where we can live and work in space has never seen closer. It's about making our lives the best we can make it. It's about as a species having a path for our future. And the mission to create these habitats is well underway as private companies get ready to take that next giant leap.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1677,2022-11-22 00:24:26
19064," to take that next giant leak. The International Space Station, it's the only space habitat we have. One of the first places they take you in the ISS is the Kupala. So you can finally look at the Earth in all its beauty in it. I don't care who you are, it's always stunning, it's shocking, it's amazing because that's the view you've been waiting for your entire life. It passes over 90% of the world's population without most of us ever realizing. And at an estimated cost of $150 billion, it's the most expensive object we've ever built. You think about like the Sistine Chapel, the Pyramids, and the Burj Khalifa, or take your pick. I mean, it far outstrips those. It's the one and only non-terrestrial human outpost. We've had a constant human footprint in orbit for almost 20 years because of the International Space Station. The collaboration between 15 countries started construction in 1998 and was pieced together in space over the course of a decade. Since 2000, it's been a permanently crude research laboratory, a space habitat that's allowed humankind to live, manufacture and explore beyond Earth. The over-arching achievement of the space station has been education. It has educated us about how to do research. It's educated us about how to live. It's educated us about the harshness of the environment that it is in. And it's about learning, I think. People say what was one of your favorite parts about being up there, hands down, floating everywhere I went. But your first impressions, where ISS certainly is, it's how big it is. The ISS is a size of an American football field. With most of that footprint taken up by eight solar arrays, these provide enough energy to power 40 homes. The station has an American side and a Russian side, as well as contributions from other nations like Canada, Japan and the European Union. Astronauts on board can pass freely between these sections. They're living and working areas are made up of modules, each 4.2 metres in diameter, and in total they have the same volume as a Boeing 747. The three main labs, destiny, hope and Columbus, are conducting up to 600 ongoing experiments at any one time. And while it's been a collaboration between governments to build and maintain the ISS, its next chapter will rely more on private enterprise. Today is a very remarkable day. NASA is opening the International Space Station to commercial opportunities and marketing these opportunities as we've never done before. Managing and maintaining the ISS costs $3.4 billion a year. That's over half NASA's space operations budget. Aging hardware and space debris will only add to these costs, which is why NASA is now hoping to pass some responsibility for the station over to commercial companies. We would like to see a robust commercial marketplace in low-earth orbit where space stations exist outside of NASA. The goal being that NASA could be a customer and we want to have numerous providers that are competing against each other on cost and innovation. With federal funding proposed to stop in 2025, opening the station to private enterprise would free up resources for the space agency's ambitions to return to the moon and journey to Mars. Transparent to a more commercial model is allowing industry to take over many of those areas that NASA has traditionally been responsible for, like the design and operations and maintenance of space systems. But the most exciting part, I think, is new opportunities. The iPhones would have never come from the government, for instance. The base technology came from the government, but the way it's used, the way it interacts with consumers, governments aren't really built for that. So I think that'll be exciting to see how private industry uses the same technology or the same systems, but then use them in a different way. Every NASA achievement has been the collaborative achievement of NASA and industry. What's going on right now that's a little bit different is, NASA is turning to companies.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1678,2022-11-22 00:28:49
19065," This achievement has been the collaborative achievement of NASA and industry. What's going on right now that's a little bit different is NASA is turning to companies not to direct them what to do, but it's turning to companies to build relationships with them because those companies are attracting investment from non-space sources and are bringing a different kind of innovation to the table. In the shadow of NASA's sprawling Johnson Space Center, the headquarters of startup Axiom space might seem a little modest, but their goal is big to build the first commercial space station. Led by a former ISS program manager, the team has been involved in every mission to the station since its inception. We know it has to be much lower cost operate on orbit than ISS is today, so this is key to continuing the heritage of ISS. It's to start there so we can evolve everybody to the next platform. I liken this to the internet. So the internet was created and we got very excited. And any kid with a good idea and just the basic programming skills could go build a program to do something. We have huge companies that grew out of that and still today there's new ideas, new things being built. The thing about a microgravity environment is it's limitless. It's like the data we have access to on the internet is limitless and it is not immediately obvious to us all the benefits that that's going to entail, but over time it will become very, very obvious. By 2024, Axiom plans to send a central node to attach to the ISS. That will make up the core of their new station. This will be followed by crew quarters for 16 people in research and manufacturing modules. When the ISS is retired, this will break away and additional modules with a lifespan of 30 years will be added and swapped out as they age using a robotic arm. And they're hoping to do all of this for 150th, the cost of the ISS. I mean when you talk about our vision it sounds really simple. It really is about driving the thought process and the cost down so that anybody that wants to take advantage of our place in orbit and a microgravity environment can do so. That's really it. Okay, I need to go towards my feet. The International Space Station is a fantastic vehicle, but one of the big things is they have quite a few major components outside, which means you have to do an EVA, a spacewalk to go fix it. A spacewalk on a good day is 100 hours of crew time to get ready and actually go do the spacewalk so we're able to take advantage of the reduced size of components. And so our design is going to have all of the components there are in the personalized environment. So we know what the basics are, you know, water, food, clothing, life support, and we know how to handle those. And now the next step is how do we make it more intuitive and we want to now take advantage of the technologies and the capabilities that have today to build more luxury into the experience. The objective is to make the environment the background for all the users. You're every day doing whatever you want to do on orbit, research, manufacturing, looking out the window. Whatever you're there to do, we want you to be able to do that not even think about the environment. And it's because of our experience on ISS and what the team brings to Axiom Space, we're able to build that environment. You won't worry about that. Three, two, one. Release, release, release. Fire, fire. Virgin Galactic and Blue Origin, Axiom is hoping to attract space tourists with tickets starting at $55 million for a 10-day mission. But that's just one part of the commercial space station market that they think could be worth $37 billion over the next decade. Our first commercial customers are countries who have astronauts in space and want to expand their activity in space. And countries who do not yet have a human spaceflight program who want to send people up. And we've now got both research and manufacturing companies who want to do work with us while we're at the International Space Station and on our platform after it separates from ISS. Human spaceflight is particularly exciting because it's that slice of space that is really nested. It hasn't undergone the crowding that satellites have had. It hasn't already had that explosive growth.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1679,2022-11-22 00:33:12
19066," That slice of space that is really nested, it hasn't undergone the crowding that satellites have had, it hasn't already had that explosive growth, it's really ready for that now. The first thing I'm really looking forward to seeing happen is the face of our first astronauts on orbit looking back down on us and knowing that we had a hand in sending that person to space. And ultimately the separation of ISS when it's ready to be retired and de-orbited and then we continue in space independently. For me, that is a stepping-off moment for humanity. It's almost like when Neil Armstrong put that first boot on the moon. This will be the first time that we've gone from a platform of learning how to live in space to building our permanent home in space. Other private companies also want to use the ISS as the starting point for their own ventures. Bigelow Aerospace already has one of its inflatable structures attached to the station and others, including Sierra Nevada and Nanorax, have put forward proposals. Space habitats are expensive. I think it's a false dichotomy to say, okay, we're done with the International Space Station. Let's move on to commercial platforms. What I think is much more likely and realistic in what NASA is certainly driving toward is an incremental transition where commercial platforms attach to the space station or work collaboratively with the space station. The next chapter cannot occur without the active engagement of companies. That said, that active engagement might not be as customers might not be as drivers. It might be in service of government mission objectives. We will return American astronauts to the moon, not only to leave behind footprints and flags, but to build the foundation we need to send Americans to Mars and beyond. This proposed mission, along with SpaceX's own ambition to reach a red planet, has opened up a longer-term market. And some companies are already thinking beyond orbiting habitats like space stations to actually building on a surface of other planets. I was working in a firm designing skyscrapers, and I saw Elon and he landed his Falcon X rocket in the middle of the ocean, and that for me was a trigger. I thought, wow, this could actually happen, and it's always been my dream to put a building on the moon or Mars, and if he's going at the pace he's going, it could definitely happen within my lifetime, and I want to be the one to build it. In this warehouse, alongside startups from across the US, architecture firm A.I. Space Factory are refining the production of Marsha. A full story structure they created for a NASA competition to design the next generation of space habitats on Mars. When we started designing our Mars habitat, Marsha, I think we looked at everything that had been done already and tossed that aside. But what we were given was a set of guidelines from NASA. They think the best way to build a habitat on Mars or the moon is to use what they call in situ resource utilization, so use the materials that are there. If you've seen sci-fi movies, you might see glass and steel domes on distant planets, but the reality is to ship that kind of material to the moon or Mars would be so exorbitant and expensive you would never be able to build in the first place. So the idea is to send a 3D printing robot, which can then harvest the materials you find on a site and build with that. The reusable print material is a mix of biopolymer, made from recycled plastic or plants like corn and sugar cane and basalt, a rock found on Mars and Earth. It's the rock that gives us its incredible strength. We've tested this material. It's three times as strong as concrete in compression. And it actually has what we call it, a tensile capacity and prevent itself from being pulled apart, which is something concrete is not very good at. You need to think at all times how do you optimize the amount of material that you use. And that's also why this thing is shaped like an egg. And if you think of an egg, it's a very structurally optimized form. It's very, very thin, but it provides the strength that the egg needs. And that's why this is shaped the way that it is. The egg shape, as well as a nested shell structure, also accommodates for extreme differences in pressure and temperature on the surface of Mars.

19067," Like, it's what's happening inside of them that may unlock the future of space industrialisation. On the next episode of Giant Leap, we'll visit the private companies who are looking to build their business around manufacturing in space. Using the unique properties of microgravity, they plan to create new materials with extraordinary qualities that can't be replicated on Earth, including new manufacturing techniques that could change how we build large structures in space and even unlock the ability to 3D print full human organs. But before low Earth orbit can become a new industrial centre, we're going to need to take another giant leap. This is how it used to work. A real estate agent would lock in the client, they'd stage the place, hold an open house every single weekend, and hope that the right buyer walks through that door. 10 years ago, you could probably go look at a house and circle back two to three weeks later and still have an opportunity to make a bid. The first time I received a lead through Instagram, my mind was blown. If you're seeing something in a neighbourhood that is established, you have two to three days after the open house in this market to make an offer. Our world has shifted so much. Folks are getting comfortable doing business either through social media or 100% virtual. Social media, like everything else it touches, has turned the real estate business upside down. You've heard this trope before, millennials aren't buying and owning as much as their parents generation. Be it a car, a diamond, or a home. But the lack of ownership is not always by choice. In 2018, a survey found that 89% of millennial Americans want to buy a home. They just can't afford it. As of 2019, millennials of all stripes owned only 5% of US housing, compared with 15% for gen Xers. Millennials haven't been able to make these big ticket purchases the same way as their predecessors did. Now this is down to the financial crisis. We have rising student loan debt and a higher cost of living. Now millennials are getting older. They're earning more money and saving more. So now is about the time where a lot of them are going out and making those purchases. And now, having been stuck at home for over a year, the same generation that embraced ubers and Airbnb's wants something to call their own. I got married and I have a child, so you know, looking for more space and thought about a conventional route of young and single and living in the city and then move out to the suburbs, we have a kid and a wife. I've seen a whole bunch of my friends just move on down to the West Palm Beach, my amy area, Austin, Texas. So they are certainly moving out of the city, but space was top of mind for them moving out. We lived in Williamsburg for about 16 plus years and week two in the pandemic, we just realized we needed more. So we started looking for a house right away. We now live in Goshen, New York, which is about an hour and a half from New York City. Instagram accounts like circa houses and cheap old houses offer a glimpse into the perfect suburban life, often at a price point not too dissimilar to what adults pay for rent in major cities.

19068," causes offer a glimpse into the perfect suburban life. Often at a price point, not too dissimilar to what adults pay for rent in major cities. By the end of 2020, New Yorkers who didn't flee paid an average of $2,700 a month for an apartment, even as rent prices plummeted during the pandemic. Millennials make a large percentage of spending right now, and that makes them a valuable consumer for brands. That means they're being courted by everyone out there to spend with them. They grew up online. They're comfortable with pretty much anything that you can do there. And that's buying things, selling things, Craigslist, eBay, all that. Making a $100 purchase on Craigslist or a $1,000 purchase on eBay, it's not that much of a leap to go even further if you're buying a fancy piece of jewelry or a house for a million bucks. The uptick in home demand fueled by the pandemic, combined with record low interest rates, has made home buying extremely competitive over the last year. So much so that some millennials look to social media to shop and actually buy their first house site unseen. I saw sort of something on my Instagram feed and, you know, clicked and we ended up seeing this house. Houses weren't really being shown at that time because we were in full lockdown. We became really interested in one YouTube video, 20 Z-LO photos, and that is it. The Red Hot Housing Market spells opportunities for developers targeting this demographic, getting eyeballs strictly through social media. People are not looking in the back section of the times anymore for real estate listings. Our demographic is between late 20s to mid 40s. And that demographic is spending a lot of time on social media. And they're doing a lot of shopping via Instagram and other social media platforms. This is Joshua Gelb and Pele Hamburger. During the pandemic, the two New York City-based developers started Neville House, a new construction project two hours north of the city. Unlike most traditional real estate listings, the pair bypassed the use of a broker and advertised their homes directly on Instagram. No fees, no commissions. You used to have to hire a broker, work with them, they would do showings on site. Now you basically put your renderings on Instagram and within an hour you have 15, 20 replies saying, can I come see it directly with you and let's see it tomorrow and it's just completely changed the game. Most people have that image in their head of the quit-essential upstate modern cabin set in the woods. We've definitely tried to tap into that and create something that's attainable for these people. It's like, you can have that, you can be swiping through Instagram and that can be your home too. There's been quite a proliferation of these direct to consumer brands. There's just tons of them out there. It's not that hard to start up a website that sells things and get things manufactured for that e-commerce platform. So like all birds with shoes, Casper with mattresses or Warby Parker with glasses. All of that means a lot more opportunity for brands in the online shopping space. So it's natural that real estate would want to get involved as well with these big ticket items. 10 years ago, the broker would drive the search. Now I think that my clients text me listings, they have alerts, they find things quicker than we do sometimes because we're out and about. I'd say that the buyer is much more involved these days. Social selling is creating brand new ways to shop. So let's look at vintage clothing, for example. There are sellers on Instagram finding successful ways to sell one of a kind items. It's that fleeting nature, the ephemeral nature of social media. You post the item online and whoever's first gets that one of a kind item. Now real estate has similar scarcity to it. There's one place to buy. It's one home, one apartment, one thing. It's one of a kind. But the rise in social media real estate isn't just about the instant gratification. Researcher Andre Perry, who studies economic inclusion at the Brookings Institute, says social media has evolved from the days of online hangout spaces and mood boards to a powerful change agent. Social media is a primary source to get news and information. But it's not just about social media.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1682,2022-11-22 00:49:35
19069," to a powerful change agent. Social media is a primary source to get news and information, but it's not just about social media, it's about the movement that we're in. The racial justice uprising really gave people a sense of worth and empowerment. And so people not only are getting information about what protects people in the long run from economic shocks, things like wealth. In his research, Andre found that not only are more millennials buying homes during the pandemic, the rate of home ownership among black millennials are at historic highs. The fastest way to accumulate wealth in this country traditionally has been through home ownership. Millennials in particular are saying, hey, I want protection, I want to live longer, I want my education to go further. That need acquire wealth and the fastest way to do that is through home ownership. When the pandemic hit many of the amenities or the comforts that came along with those living conditions were gone. Folks couldn't go to bars and fancy shops. And so you saw instead of people going out and buying clothes, they saved their money and bought property and outside of the city generally. People are moving to the suburbs, to rural areas, places where home prices are a little bit cheaper. Many home buyers are looking for houses outside the major metropolitan areas. Additionally, many home buyers are looking for direct outdoor access and added space as the uncertainty about the virus persists. Millennials are also looking to influencers not just for the latest trends and tick-tock dances, but to partake in important conversations, be it about politics or personal finance or anything in between. I'm not going to stay on the ship. Let's start small. Let's don't be scared to start small instead of renting a big house in the hills and California like most artists do by you on that's on the flat. I meet folks like Brandon Rool and Charlotte main the God. You have residential real estate and you have commercial real estate. They're talking about buying homes. When I was coming out, really home buying was a mysterious, shrouded process that only a few people could teach me. Now I can easily log on to Clubhouse or Instagram and find literally lessons on how to purchase a home, but done with savvy and finesse. Today we're going to make a greenhouse. I am DIY-ing the entire closet. Heather, having bought her fixer-up or site-on-scene, also looked to internet personalities to help figure out how to modernize and to make sure her home was also an investment. It gave us a lot of confidence. Super easy. How we could do all of those things ourselves. My husband just installed a laundry shoe which is something we never would have thought of if we didn't see an influencer do that and how easy it actually is. Really simple to do it yourself project. You can do that. You have any questions go ahead and message me. And in the case of Neville House, Josh and Paley hope that buyers see these homes as potential secondary income. These young families look at these products and look at our homes and say, here's a turn key. This can serve our family, but this can also be the perfect rental. We've tried to strike a balance in the design of a home who are working well as a family home. That's going to be lived in and also working as an investment. A lot of this points to how millennials can utilize and leverage social media to their benefit. But it also speaks to again this moment that folks want freedom. So millennials are really stepping up to this real estate game and taking ownership and building well. Of course not everything is as it seems online. While social media can be a useful tool for learning, there's still a lot it can't tell you about the home buying experience or living in the suburbs for that matter. We knew going into it, budgeting for a lot of renovations. We kind of thought if we buy it at $450, we could put $300,000 into the house and really make it ours and our own.

19070," put to 300,000 into the house and really make it ours and our own. I can't wait to replace in this kitchen and update our built-in deep fryer, which was not in the listing photos. We kind of got into the house and we realized that budget was completely unrealistic. We have a lot of people who see our design on Instagram, they say, I love it, can you come build this on my property? And then they'll send us the lot, which they bought site on scene during COVID and because of site conditions or zoning, it's virtually unbuildable. I think we all know that what you see on Instagram and what you see in real life are two very different things. So while we can definitely, as brokers, create these fantastic narratives, the one recommendation that I would give is do your homework? Don't believe everything you say. That's not to say that, you know, there's dishonesty or anything where people are trying to manipulate you, but not everything you see is accurate. This shift towards social media house hunting may also help to bring equilibrium to a market that has historically disadvantaged specific groups of buyers. Many of the traditional ways that people get mortgages or loans often precluded black people because they deemed us too risky for those loans. With technology, there's ways to get around that. As long as more black people get educated on racism and discrimination in lending, we're going to figure out ways to get around that racism. When I was 24 years old, I saw the UFC on a paper view on TV and I was so overwhelmed by the athleticism, the skill. And then at the end of the fight, the combatants hugged, they shook hands, and I just fell in love with it. Part of UFC's appeal is it doesn't look like a ballad athletic display of martial talent and mastery as much as it looks like a bar fight. We choose to do this because we love this sport, but it is a business. And if you do not treat it like a business, I guarantee you that the promoter is and you will be left broken, broken at the end of your career. Each of us have an individual story, but as with anything you take enough of these individual stories and you see not only crossover but intersectionality. A group of former UFC fighters that are suing the UFC scored a key legal victory on Thursday when a federal judge said he would grant their lawsuit class action status. There have been fights in every major US sport about workers' power in the labor market. I don't think there's a guy in the sport from the guy who just got his first fight all the way up to the Conor McGregor's that is pleased with the way the UFC treats fighters. The way we've been strong armed, the way we've been coerced. Fights over unionization in some sports, fights over free agency in baseball, and in boxing, the Muhammad Ali Act, which restricts.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1684,2022-11-22 00:58:23
19071," In some sports, fights over free agency in baseball and in boxing, the Muhammad Ali Act, which restricts the kinds of contract terms that can be imposed on boxers. The fighters who brought this lawsuit see it as the continuation of a tradition in sports, of athletes fighting to have agency and power in the terms of their work and who they do it for. Mixed Martial Arts used to be pretty culturally and legally French in the United States. It was banned by most states. John McCain had famously called it human cock fighting. There are some rules in the UFC, but to a large extent, all sorts of body parts and tactics and attacks are on the table. And people get seriously injured at times. My nose has been broken multiple times. I had my right pectoral torn off, had to get that reattached. I've had my jaw broken, two places, I've had my neck broken. I had my left ankle broken, had to get that repaired. I've had a torn right labor in my shoulder. He broke my eyeball. I mean, the bone that holds up my eyeball. I've had my left eye, orbital fracture, twice where my eye caved in. I was walling my own blood. I knew, don't blow your nose or both eyes will blow. At the time that UFC was bought for just $2 million by the former boxing coach, Dana White, and a casino owner he'd been friends with, Lorenzo Fertida, and his brother Frank Fertida, UFC was struggling as were other mixed martial arts promoters. It was pretty much a fixer-upper. The money that they spent to actually purchase it for $2 million was much less than the money they quickly had to sink into it in order to revitalize it. They've hold off a multi-pronged strategy that was quite successful. First, they did what White has referred to as running towards regulation. They found ways to make compromises with state regulators so that the sport would not be illegal. And at the same time, they also popularized it. They made gambles like paying the production costs themselves for the first season of a reality TV show, The Ultimate Fighter on Spike TV. UFC, Under Dana White, had a gift for weaving, compelling personal narratives and rivalries, people throwing shoes, a guy coming to the octagon with who let the dogs out playing while he was dragging another guy on a leash. My first contract with the UFC is kind of an interesting story because here I am on this reality show The Ultimate Fighter. And they started to realize how big of a stepping stone this was going to be for the UFC. It's at us all down individually, put a contract in front of us and said, Hey, we realized this is going to be huge and we really want to have you all a part of this UFC family moving forward. So we want to go ahead and get this out of the way, just sign this simple contract and we'll be able to move forward as one unit. But as I'm looking at this thick contract and wondering what I should do, Dana White looks at me and says, don't worry, this thing takes off, we'll take care of you. The fighters would say at the heart of UFC's power is the contract that it signs with fighters. Before boxing had competition boxing used to be dominated by a few dominant promoters and the contracts were ported over from boxing. And the contracts are basically designed to control every aspect of a fighter's career. They're long term. They last multiple fights. Fighters under these contracts are bound to fight only for UFC for a period of time. And UFC can extend that time if a fighter declines a match or if a fighter gets injured. They control who...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1685,2022-11-22 01:02:36
19072," And UFC can extend that time if a fighter declines a match or if a fighter gets injured. They control who the fighter fights, they control when the fighter fights, and then they have a number of different clauses that make it very difficult for a fighter to ever break free from UFC if that fighter ever did want to become a creation. Contracts are so one-sided, there really is no negotiation room for any of the things, especially as you're coming up and as their stranglehold on the sport of MMA got so much stronger. Part of what's at the heart of this lawsuit is the ways that UFC successfully took other competitors off the board. The UFC had such a stranglehold on mixed martial arts and as they were buying up so much of the competition shutting them all down, they really became the only option for anybody that wanted to do this professionally. If you follow Dana White's Twitter or watch him on YouTube, you could have seen Dana White calling himself the grim reaper and bragging about how he has defeated or derailed. Or acquired one after another company that tried to compete with the UFC. In 2011, UFC acquired strike force, which at the time was the most prominent rival still standing. Come lead is unbelievable. It was a great fight this year for it one more time, Scott Smith and Kong Lee. The CEO of Strike Force, Scott Koker, has said in the past that he saw himself like Luke Skywalker up against the Death Star trying to compete with UFC. Eventually, when Strike Force was bought out by UFC, my only option was go to UFC because they had the rest of my contract. Now I'm under a contract where it's only an 18 month contract with six fights, but five years later, I'm still stuck in the contract. The month before UFC's pairing company, Zufa, completed its acquisition of Strike Force, a UFC executive sent an email and the subject line of that email was, we own MMA. And the UFC has admitted in documents that have now become public that they've almost never lost a fighter that they wanted to keep. In internal UFC emails, we now know the company referred to what it was doing as choking off oxygen to the competition. The most important oxygen that UFC allegedly ran afoul of the law by cutting off to its competitors is the fighters themselves. And not only did they make it clear to us, they made it clear to the whole mixed martial arts world, there is no negotiating. These are very strict, never-ending contracts and that's the case for this day. The UFC just says, oh, you want to fight for us, you sign here. If you don't want to, we've got 20 other guys that'll take your spot. They have 70, 80, 90% of the top fighters under exclusive contract, meaning that those fighters are not available to any other MMA promoter. And fighters, even if they wiggled their way out of the very restrictive contract that UFC imposed on them, didn't have another professional mixed martial arts option because there weren't robust rivals to go sell their work to. On Tuesday afternoon, a class action lawsuit was filed in US District Court in San Jose.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1686,2022-11-22 01:06:52
19073," because there weren't robust rivals to go sell their work to. On Tuesday afternoon, a class action lawsuit was filed in US District Court in San Jose against Zufa LLC with fighters Kung Lee, Nate Corey, and John Fitch attached to the suit. Ram paid Jackson, came to me and says, hey, Kung, I know this lawyer, he will help get the fairness for the fighters in the marketplace. And I decided I wanted to step up for all the fighters that he affected. At the end of 2014, more than six years ago now, a group of now all former fighters filed anti-trust class action lawsuit against UFC. And in broad terms, the case is an antitrust case where we're claiming that the UFC is both a monopoly and a monopsony. Usually when we talk about monopoly, we're talking about the power that a company has when it becomes the only one selling something. Monopsony is about the power of being a monopoly purchaser of something, and particularly a monopoly purchaser of labor. A key argument in this lawsuit has been about as UFC succeeds in its revenue sores, how much should we expect that absent illegal conduct, the fighters pay would soar as well. In UFC, year after year, the share of the company is revenue that goes to actually paying the workers doing the fighting has hovered around or below 20%. And what this analysis shows through complex statistical regression modeling is that if the UFC was competitive and did not allegedly violate the antitrust laws, it would pay its fighters 50% or more of the revenues is generated just like baseball, just like hockey, just like basketball, boxing. If instead of paying 20% of the revenues generated, it paid 50% or more of the revenues generated, the fighters would have made $1.6 billion more during the period that we measured 2010 to 2017. Sometimes when you write about allegations against companies, and particularly about lawsuits against companies, those companies don't want to say a whole lot about them or are pretty dismissive of the significance of litigation against them. UFC in their comments to me has been pretty feisty about this, saying that they see this lawsuit actually as a threat to the ability of businesses to take risks and succeed, and that they don't want to roll over, that they want to fight it and they want to defeat it. The fighters I talked to described having side jobs, being reliant on UFC in part because after taxes and expenses, they weren't making enough money to feel financially secure. The overview of my career from a financial perspective is something that I had a challenge in admitting, I can tell you now that I lived in my mom's attached to her mom's the entire time I was fighting and I had a second job as a bouncer and a bartender, a third job as a personal trainer, just to make ends meet. Nate Quarry told me that over his time in UFC, he fought fights while he was tens of thousands of dollars in debt coming into the fight. It gets so disheartening because I've seen fights that are called the fight of the year. This is just this brutal war and they battled for four and a half rounds until one guy's body just gave up and then you find out, oh that guy made $60,000 for that fight. In one of the hearings in this lawsuit, UFC's attorney argued that if the fighters were really the product, if all that UFC were selling were the fighters, then the fighters wouldn't need UFC at all. That a fighter is not themselves the UFC product anymore than an Apple engineer who makes a cool iPhone.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1687,2022-11-22 01:11:49
19074," Any more than an Apple engineer who makes a cool iPhone is the product that Apple is selling. We the fighters make this whole thing happen and it's been driven by Chuck LaDelle. It's been driven by Rating Attours, been driven by Conor McGregor, it's been driven by Brock Lesnar, it's been driven by all the greats that have walked before us and that walk this path right now. We are the product. If the fighters are not the product, then go ahead and release us from our contracts. You'll do fine without us. Clearly. It's the identity and rank and popularity of those fighters that attract the eyeballs and make the sport what it is. And if you can lock all those up and keep them from other promotions, you can dominate the sport, which is what they've admitted they've done. William Isaacson, a lawyer for UFC, said in a statement that UFC has spent many years building a world-class organization enhancing the brand of our athletes and championing the sport of MMA. UFC pays its fighters more than any other MMA promoter with average fighter compensation rising by over 600% since 2005. Our efforts have raised the global popularity of the sport and the overall revenue potential of all MMA organizations and athletes. In December of 2020, the judge announced a crucial step in this lawsuit, which is that he is going to certify it as a class action. Class certification makes this lawsuit a much more significant threat to UFC. And the judge made clear long before saying how he planned to rule that he expected whatever he did to be appealed into federal appeals court and on from there to the US Supreme Court. So we are likely in for many more months and years of wrangling over this. Kyle Kingsbury said that he doesn't think any settlement would be acceptable unless it includes a change to the restrictive contracts that UFC uses to keep fighters bound to the UFC. My son is about to turn six years old and it started when he was in the womb. We are in this thing to the end to change the sport forever. We want the same freedoms that are offered in any other major sport. Every other major sport has gone through what we are going through right now. People tell fighters, just shut up. Look at how lucky you are. Well, no, actually we are fighting for what we believe in. We are going to continue being fighters and that is how we are made. We are going to continue being fighters and that is how we are made. We are going to continue being fighters and that is how we are made. Every nation that is a coastal state has some region of the sea floor that falls within their territorial waters and many countries including the U.S., the area that is under water exceeds the area that is above water. So huge amounts of nations, areas and regions are just really unexplored, uncharacterized. We don't really know what is there. We know less about our sea bed than we do about the surface of the moon or Mars. Only 20% of it has been mapped.

19075," of the moon or Mars, only 20% of it has been mapped. A map of the sea floor could lead to all kinds of discoveries, like numerous species and rare earth minerals like cobalt that we need for electric cars and mobile phones. The value of all the gold deposits alone on the sea floor is estimated to be around 150 trillion dollars. A map could also help us when tragedy strikes. Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 disappeared from radar screens. The mapping of the ocean floor is being carried out. The problem is that the Southern Indian Ocean is just so incredibly huge. To me, a map is a fundamental piece of understanding of who we are, where we are, where things are. Once you understand something, you start to value it more. When you start to value something, that's when you start to really think about making it healthy and preserving it and keeping it going. A map is the first step, it's the basic understanding that you need to figure out where you are. Oceans. They cover over 70% of the planet, but most of what lies underneath is a mystery. The sea floor is a really fascinating landscape. We don't have a lot of data to describe the shape of it in detail, but in places where we do, there are spectacular features, there's meandering channels with all kinds of interesting topography, there are canyons, there are sea mounts, mid ocean ridges, all kinds of things that we see on land that are just basically hidden from us by the water. As it stands, this is what a map of the sea bed looks like. All that black? Those are the parts we haven't mapped yet. At present, most people think that the sea floor is actually mapped because you'll see a world ocean map and you can see some shape of the sea floor, but most of that is based on prediction. Roughly 80% of what you see for the world ocean floor is modeled based on measurements of the sea surface height and a computation based on gravity. In 2017, the Nippon Foundation and the General Barthometric Chart of the Oceans, or Jebco, launched Sea Bed 2030. It's a collaborative project to collect and collate data oceanwide and create a complete map of the sea floor by the end of the decade. To do this would take one ship around 350 years at a cost of up to $3 billion. That's why data is harvested by all kinds of vessels from fishing boats to freighters. Because there is so little data, it's important that vessels that are capable and willing to acquire data when they're just moving around the ocean do so. So we have a lot of data that's collected during transit. There's a lot of academic requirements to make data publicly available. There's industry data that's starting to become more and more available. There's government data. So there's a lot of different ways that this data is coming in and it's a really messy and challenging puzzle to put together. But what's exciting is that it's a puzzle that put together. LAUGHTER Since Sea Bed 2030 launched, the area map has risen to 20%, and all the information collected is freely available. The more data we have, collectively, and other people can access, the faster the discoveries are made, which really pushes forward our understanding at a faster rate than if you held onto that data, and it was only you with that data. Things like machine learning and artificial intelligence are also going to kick in in the next decade. Because with all this data, they'll be able to make connections that are a lot faster than perhaps we would have been able to, which then again feeds our human understanding and also gives us new ideas, new ways of thinking, of exploration. Until the early 20th century, mapping technology was simple. Usually a weight attached to a long rope known as a lead line. After the Titanic sank in 1912, explorers proposed using sound waves to find its hole in the North Atlantic. This led to Sona, the most common technique used for mapping today. Operated by the Schmidt Ocean Institute, the Falcourt is an 82 meter long research vessel.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1689,2022-11-22 01:20:01
19076," It's common technique used for mapping today. Operated by the Schmidt Ocean Institute, the Falcaw is an 82 meter long research vessel. Equipped with two multi-beam sonar systems that have helped Deborah Smith and a team of other marine technicians to map over a million square kilometres of the sea floor. You know, you go from somebody with a rope with some knots to sonar acoustics that is, I call it math magic, but it is incredibly advanced mathematical technology to be able to measure the distance and time of travel of sound on a moving ship. Multi-beam mapping works by using sonars. So sonar is taking sound and measurement of time. So you have a multi-beam sonar and it sends out a ping of sound. That sound travels through the water column, hits the sea floor and comes back to the ship and we measure that time and we're able to calculate the distance. Each individual ping of sound has many many beams. So it looks like a giant fan across the sea floor and that fan is moving along the sea floor. So you have many tiny little beams going across and they're traveling along a track. You can look at that data and look at both the peaks and the valleys and the highs and the lows and sort of create a three-dimensional image of the sea floor. The accuracy of multi-beam sonar really depends on the water depth that you're in. Think of it like a flashlight beam and if you're holding a flashlight and you're shining it on the floor, the closer you get to the floor with your flashlight the smaller that beam is. If you have 400 of these beams all across, I think of 400 people holding a flashlight. The closer they hold that flashlight to the sea floor, the smaller your beam is which also means the smaller that you can find information or data about. So it really depends on the depth of the sea floor in order to see how much you can define an object. This variation in depth means that mapping resolution will range from 100 by 100 meters in shallow waters to 800 by 800 meters in the deepest parts of the ocean which go down as far as 11,000 meters. Remotely operative vehicles or ROVs can then be sent down to investigate sea-bed features up close. We've just crossed the 1000 metre mark. It's 4.6 degrees sea and now we're going to drive the ROV down at a high rate towards the sea floor. On a recent mapping expedition, scientists on the Falcon were discovered a 500 meter tall coral structure in Australia's Great Barrier Reef, the first to be discovered in over 120 years. A place that is incredibly popular, well-visited, well-traveled, you know, we're still finding new things. You don't know until you map it and so until you get that sort of high resolution picture, you don't know the sand waves or the old riverbeds that used to be there or the waterfall is off the side of a volcano that used to be above the surface and now is below the surface. It's a little bit of everything. Think of let's say Hawaii or someplace where you see a volcano above the water, picture that below the water. I'm really kind of obsessed with the whole concept of scale here. Although we can create 3D models and, you know, kind of come up with these visualizations, it's not the same as that feeling of looking out over this big landscape, but I mean, I think we'll get there soon with VR and other kinds of technology, but it's really spectacular to think about, especially with the familiarity that some of us have with these features, like what it looks like. We look out at the ocean and it just looks flat, maybe with little bumps. We really don't think about all of this that's underneath and it's really an amazing landscape that's just hidden from us. With more than 90% of the ocean deeper than 200 meters, fleets of autonomous vehicles could make the data gathering process faster, cheaper and safer. A new discoveries might help with exploration of all kinds. I think the ocean can actually provide us with huge incidences, we go out into space as well and look for life and other kinds of life forms. I also think in this next a few years we will have a different kind of access to the ocean because of virtual reality and augmented reality and for that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1690,2022-11-22 01:24:25
19077," Next a few years we will have a different kind of access to the ocean because of virtual reality and augmented reality and for that we'll allow us to sit in our living rooms and really experience what's underwater in a different way and see this different alien planet. Since the dawn of man, meat has been on the menu. And even with growing trends of vegetarian diets and plant-based substitutes, around 89% of the world population consider themselves omnivores. We have come a long way from our hunter and gatherer routes. We have managed to establish a whole industry designed to feed almost 7.7 billion people. We've maximized production and we managed to reduce hunger over the past couple of decades. And although we've become exceedingly efficient at putting meat on the table, raising livestock animals by the billions comes with its own set of consequences. If animal agriculture continues to expand the way it has, there is a race that we won't be able to stop climate change. But with rapid advances in technology, we might soon see a food industry that leaves all those problems behind. I'm Bait to be one of the world's first commercial customers for lab-grown meat, cultured meat. It's eat-just as the company and I'm very, very excited. Here is the chicken meat. It's pretty crispy outside. That's really good. I mean, look, it's really tasty. Here at 1880 in Singapore, culture chicken is being served under a regulatory approval granted by the Singaporean government. It's the very first time a cultured meat product, meat made from animal cells grown in a lab, has been approved for commercial sale. Eat-just, the company behind these chicken nugget-style dishes is based out of San Francisco and got their start in 2011, developing plant-based egg substitutes, like mung bean scrambled eggs and mayonnaise. But it wasn't until 2017 that they announced they were shifting focus to a cultured meat product. In order to feed the world that we live in, a lot of animal protein, we need to take a third today and it'll be more tomorrow of our world and make it dedicated to feeding chickens and cows. We go to areas that are filled with biodiversity rainforests, taking a bulldozer to them and planting soy and corn, to feed the chickens that we climate change is accelerated by the kind of animal production that we engage in. When we bring animals in tiny little space, it accelerates the probability that more zoonotic diseases are going to impact our families. And from a morality perspective, why do we need to cause any harm to any other living thing, to have dinner that tastes good? It does not have to be that way. And those things underlie the force of this idea. The meat alternatives that have made it to the market thus far have been plant-based. Immutation, beef and pork made from...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1691,2022-11-22 01:28:50
19078," And those things underlie the force of this idea. The metal turnitives that have made it to the market thus far have been plant-based. Imitation, beef and pork made from ingredients like pea protein and coconut oil by companies like Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods. That's a very different proposition from cultured meat, which is made from actual animal cells. I'm a huge fan of any company, of any person trying to make a product that's improving the food system, including all the plant-based proteins. Maybe in some future menu you'll have this kind of cultivated chicken, and you'll also have a plant-based version. That's fine. But I guess you have to ask yourself in our lifetime, is that diner likely to also remove the conventional option on the menu too? We do think we need a more permanent solution. We do think we sort of need, if you will, an end game to this problem, and we just think this is more likely to be the path to achieve that. So animal cell technology has been around for several decades for applications such as development of vaccines and other biotherapeutics. The first known prototype of cultured meat was done by Mark Posts earlier in 2011, and essentially he was developing beef patty. It was a very expensive prototype, if I'm not mistaken above 250,000 euros at the time to produce just one beef patty. It was more of a group of concepts to really demonstrate that this technology is possible, and that it can be done. The way that we grow and produce culture chicken is essentially a weak isolate chicken cells from chickens without having to kill them. So from a small biopsy, for instance, we immerse these cells in a liquid broth that contains the nutrients that the cells need to survive and be healthy and to grow. We really need these cells to multiply, to reach the numbers that are sufficient to make a meat product. We're looking into the cells that are really important for meat, so we think about muscle cells, fat cells, by the isolation we are able to form those muscle tissues in culture. The culture happens inside of a fermentation tank, what we call the bioreactor, which is essentially providing the same conditions as the animal body. Warm temperatures, some sort of mechanical stimulation, so that the cells that are exposed to very similar conditions that they have inside of the animal. After the cells proliferate and reach a certain density, the final step is essentially to separate those cells from the liquid broth that they are in. We just make sure that the product meets our quality and safety standards, and then those cells are ready for consumption. Milk, cheese, yogurt, a lot of those derived from fermentations. The only difference is that they are starting from a different cell type. In this case, we're just using the animal cells as the initial and beginning of the product. Eatjust has developed chicken nuggets so far, with far more textured chicken breast plan for the future. But another cell-based meat startup Memphis Meets has already started working on culturing other animal cells as well. We've done beef, we've done duck, we've done chicken, and these are things that are favourites in various parts of the world. For instance, people in America love beef and chicken. People in China love duck, so we wanted to show that we at Memphis Meets can produce meats that we have a global population love to eat. There's a lot of similarity on how we grow the meats from various animals or fish, but they're also different because of nutrients they need and how they actually come together to form the final product of meat. I think it's very similar to how we also grow various animals. There's similarities in the feed that we gave cows and pigs and chickens, but there's also differences how we cultivate, and it's very similar for us as well. We've been working with the FDA and the USDA for the last three years, and really developing the guidelines on how this food should be regulated when we come to the market. As soon as we get regulatory approval in the United States, people will be able to go to the supermarket and buy it and enjoy it. They'll be able to go to a restaurant near them and order meat directly from animal cells. But it's not just getting the meat right.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1692,2022-11-22 01:33:04
19079," States people will be able to go to their supermarket and buy it and enjoy it. They'll be able to go to a restaurant near them and order meat directly from animal cells. But it's not just getting the meat right. Once approved, the gates open to a very high potential demand and scaling becomes the next big hurdle. Before we can only make chicken for myself, my friends, my girlfriend, my family, my colleagues, now we actually have the ability to make chicken for millions of people. So that allows us to invest and to allow the economies to scale to drop the price. The second is we need to reduce the cost of the nutrients that these cells are consuming. So I think chicken feed, raises, or drops of price of chicken. The nutrients we feed ourselves, those are the same things. We need to drive that down. The cell density is another technical element. We need to continue to increase that and hammering on those things. So of the course, and that's five, 10, 15 years, we'll put us in a place where we're significantly below the cost of this animal protein and that will be one of the main inflection points that we'll lead to a new way of eating meat. So here is a close-up of a half-eaten crispy chicken bite. You know what? What I'm really thinking is, I'm just eating chicken. I like chicken. No, the normal chickens eat, I don't know where they came from. And so I don't know why I should be very stressed where this came from either. The meat market is worth more than $1 trillion annually and there are over 60 startups in the cultured meat field. Cultured meat has attracted several prominent investors including Sergi Brin, Richard Branson and Bill Gates. What is also interesting is that even meat giants such as Cargill and Tyson have invested in space, it's this destructive potential of the market as well as the promise to greatly reduce the climate impact of meat production that has attracted investors. It remains to be seen who will get regulatory approval in which countries and whether consumers will like lab ground meat enough to make the switch. And while there's no evidence that lab ground meat is any less healthy than traditional meat, there's an ongoing debate over how healthy eating meat is in general. But if these products are a success, they could be the beginning of a more humane, less destructive meat industry. The food and ag industry is the most innovative industry in the world. It's always figured out how to feed a growing population and we've never failed doing so. And it's been very clear to us that we are part of that and we're going to figure out how to feed the next three billion people joining us and I just see an evolution. We can do this a bit differently. We can do this in a way that is consistent with the kind of people that we want to be, the kind of planet that we all want to live in. We can build a food system that reflects really the best characteristics of who we are and that makes me really hopeful. Impossible foods might be the world's most ambitious company. Just listen to founder and CEO Pat Brown. People wonder how big the plant-based meat industry is going to be. It will be the meat industry in 20 years. We're going to look back and basically say, wow, remember back in the day when we used his animals to make meat.

19080," Impossible stated gold really is to replace the use of animals as a food production technology globally by 2035 That would mean supplanting a 1.2 trillion dollar industry not to mention a source of sustenance as old as time To be fair the company has got a lot of people talking about its products So there's this thing called the impossible burger. What's called artificial meat the realest fake-est burger in the world Not bad But before impossible foods can take over the world It's going to have to overcome strong competitors penetrate tough new markets and generally transform its product from a Conversation piece into a ubiquitous staple food With the coronavirus turning the world of food upside down This could be the moment when impossible's new fangled meat goes mainstream In Impossible foods was founded in 2011 when Pat Brown a long-time vegan was nearing the end of an accomplished career in biochemistry I've been assigned just my whole life and just came to this realization that by far the most important scientific question in the world is What makes me delicious Pat Brown someone call a zealot for his mission He really doesn't hold back when it comes to talking about wanting to completely replace animal agriculture producing Meat from animals is the most destructive technology on earth and if we're going to avert catastrophic climate change and we have to find a better way to produce meat You've probably heard about the dangers of cow flatchlance their digestive systems produce large quantities of the powerful greenhouse gas Mefane in fact, it's estimated that livestock farming is responsible for nearly 15% of all greenhouse gas emissions Impossible claims it takes 89% less G.H.G's 87% less water and 96% less land to produce its burger The key of course would be to get people to actually eat the thing which is where the company's secret ingredient comes in Heem a genetically engineered substance with a bloody iron rich taste like red meat So heem is a very controversial part of the impossible burger It's also what makes the impossible burger what it is There are a lot of consumer groups and anti-GMO groups that oppose the impossible burger because of the heem The studies on its safety are pretty short-term but the FDA has approved it and the company says it's completely safe and There isn't any evidence that it isn't Critics have also challenged the company's claim to health advantages over traditional meat Pointing out that while the impossible burger has less fat, sodium and calories than its beefy cousin It's also more highly processed But let's be real. We're talking about mimicking hamburgers here not kale salads These burgers are definitely better for the environment, so that's a plus But they are not necessarily better for your health After years in the lab Patan's colleagues were confident they had a product even Ron's sponsor could love and the impossible burger made its debut in 2016 Their burger began its life in the public when it was sold at David Chang's mom with Fuku and They went from sort of higher-end Find dining restaurants into higher-end burger restaurants like bear burger and mommy burger And then suddenly they started popping up everywhere. It tastes like a burger. It tastes like meat. This is all made from plants All made from plants. This tastes like beef. Doesn't that just look like real meat? So meat-like. They always say it's what they say. Just like a burger. It tastes like yuckers Leaves full as the world, the relics. Yeah, it doesn't taste like a burger. Opinions differed on the impossible burger's relative Metinus but the debate itself was fantastic Re-advertising help him to propel impossible into major chains like white castle and then in the summer of 2019 into more than 7,000 burger kings across the US To date the company has raised over a billion dollars and a funding round in March valued the company at around four billion",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1694,2022-11-22 01:41:47
19081," To date, the company has raised over a billion dollars and a funding round in March valued the company at around four billion. But fake meat is a happening space these days and impossible faces some daunting competition. So I'm now for the stock of the hour and that is Beyond Meat, shares of the faux meat or plant-based protein company are soaring today. Beyond Meat is also making a very meaty burger from plants. They're very non-GMO, they stress that all the time to differentiate themselves from impossible. It'll be much easier to genetically modify plant material to make it take on the texture and appearance and aroma of animal protein. We won't do that. Beyond Meat had one of the biggest IPOs of the year in 2019. So impossible, which is still privately held, has some catching up to do. But you won't hear Pat Brown knocking his biggest competitor. I wish them nothing but success. They have the same mission we have. The only rival we care about is the incumbent animal-based industry. Rivals or not, impossible and beyond certainly agree on one thing. The true prize isn't the American market, it's China. 27% of the world's meat is consumed in China compared to just 9% in the US. The Chinese population eats a ton of meat, they're a huge market. China is a really interesting case because they have long had vegetarian cuisine as part of their culinary culture. And whether they are looking for meat replacements is still an open question. What we found in our reporting is that some consumers are excited about them. It's just we don't know if it's going to be enough. To improve its prospects, impossible is developing a plant-based replacement for pork. Globally pork is the most widely consumed meat. It's almost 40% of all the meat consumed globally. Number one in Europe, number one in China. So if we're going to achieve our mission, pork is right up there. No word yet on when impossible pork will be available. This morning, growing concerns about the nation's food supply. From butchers to national supermarkets, supplies now limited and prices rising. The impact of the coronavirus on the price and availability of meat has given a boost to companies like Impossible Foods. Over the four weeks ending April 19, sales of plant-based meat increased. But Impossible has acknowledged some negative effects from the pandemic as well. This being a product that has primarily been served in restaurants, they took a pretty big hit with all the food service shutdowns. Although the company doesn't want to say how much of a hit they have, however, announced some new retail rollouts. Recently they announced that they're going to be rolling out with the crogr supermarkets. And that's big, that's great for them. The question of whether this is like a long term sea change for these companies. Just have to wait and see. It's safe to say Impossible stands a slim chance of achieving its goal of replacing the entire meat industry. But it's early days for the science of plant-based meat, and it's not impossible that these products could one day contribute to a greener, more humane future. In the meantime, as the technology improves, we get to look forward to many more years of this. This is meat. No, this isn't possible. Yeah, that's what I thought. This is the meat burger. I like it better. It's not even close to a veggie burger or a tofu burger or anything. Wow, that's very, very much. Hot potato.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1695,2022-11-22 01:46:15
19082," What are is a strategically important point? On the map of Pakistan, it sits very close to Iran actually on the very southern coast. It's about a 10-hour drive west of Karachi, but it's only about an hour drive to Iran. The area is extremely poor. It's very arid. It doesn't have enough water. Electricity has been a very spotty. One of the most surprising things about visiting Guadar is the high degree of security that is absolutely everywhere. There are armed guards that are required to escort foreign visitors everywhere you go because it is contested in the region because there have been militant attacks in the past. Despite all this, Guadar is a key part of the China-Pakistan economic corridor, also known as CPEC. The Crown Jewel of President Xi Jinping's Belt and Road Initiative. We will leave no stone unturned in ensuring that CPEC and all the projects under its umbrella are materialised in time and in full. So far, just one-third of all CPEC projects have been completed. In Guadar, none of them have been and the promised improvements for local people like job creation and better infrastructure have not materialised. So what has China got to gain from developing this seemingly obscure city on the Pakistani coast? We have seen this movie before. An outside power comes into Pakistan. It spends heavily on big infrastructure projects. China is not the first to do it. Right after Pakistan became independent in the late 1940s, early 50s, the US was sending advisers into Pakistan to help plant economy. The US was doing infrastructure projects there too. Those early projects helped the US gain Pakistan as an ally against the Soviet Union during the Cold War. The US has provided about $80 billion in aid to Pakistan since its independence, but overall the result is disappointing. One of the recent attempts was in the late 2000s as part of the US effort to combat terrorism in Afghanistan. The number one item on that aid package was to build these high visibility infrastructure projects. So there are literally projects that the United States tried to do or Pakistan proposed to the United States in the 2000s during that period that have become Belt and Road projects. China is stepping into a gap which has been left by retreating ambition from the US. The Belt and Road initiative is China's President Xi Jinping's signature foreign policy initiative. Launched in 2013, it comprises an overland belt stretching through China's central Asia into Europe and a maritime road stretching around Southeast Asia through the India Ocean and up past East Africa. So a benign way of characterising China's Belt and Road initiative would be infrastructure for influence. So when Xi Jinping announced the Belt and Road initiative, shortly afterwards China designated Pakistan as its showcase flagship project. So the China Pakistan Economic Quarter was going to be the biggest and most important showcase for the success of the Belt and Road. Pakistan is in great need of infrastructure development. They wanted to create a railway, highway, roads, all kinds of economic development that is intended to help Pakistan. And it's meant to provide jobs 2.3 million.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1696,2022-11-22 01:50:17
19083," All kinds of economic development that is intended to help Pakistan and it's meant to provide jobs, 2.3 million jobs for Pakistanis. It's meant to provide a 2.5% boost to GDP growth. And China would gain economically as well. CPEC was intended to reduce oil and gas routes from the Middle East by thousands of miles, a way to cut overland into western China instead of going around Southeast Asia by ship. Projects in Pakistan also provide Chinese state owned companies with an additional market. Chinese workers are brought to Pakistan to build infrastructure and then take wages home. CPEC is also strategically significant for China and Pakistan. China wants to strengthen this relationship to counter their shared rival India. CPEC is both an instrument of Chinese power as well as a test of Chinese power. If it succeeds, China will be demonstrating that it's able to do what great powers have not been able to do in Pakistan, including the United States. Which is why Guadal is so important. It's in Pakistan's Balochistan province, an area with serious electricity and water shortages. Balochistan province is actually populated by people who are of Baloch origin. There are different ethnicity. They speak a different language from the majority in power in Islamabad. And they feel as the poorest province in Pakistan, they have not sufficiently benefited from some of the economic achievements that the rest of Pakistan has had. That area is quite contested by the Balochistan Liberation Army. The people who feel that even Pakistani people have encroached into their territory. So quite a number of people are still staging attacks and they attacked the biggest international hotel in Guadar. Shout up the lobby and killed I think five people. But this unsettled city is where the China-Pakistan economic corridor is supposed to lead to. Authorities plan to develop Guadar into an international port city. Guadar port has an interesting history and an interesting location too. It's located in Balochistan. It's about 120 kilometers from Iran. Pakistan purchased this territory from Oman, I think, in the 1950s. And so for a long time Pakistan has had on its agenda trying to develop this area. Since the 70s, it's wanted to build a port in Guadar. Actually approached the United States in the 1970s and tried to convince the Nixon administration to pay for a port. Even offered naval access if the United States was willing to pay for that. The US rejected Pakistan's offer. Concerned that the port would not be commercially viable and would cause geopolitical tension. But in the early 2000s a Chinese company was awarded the contract to build the port. And they completed phase one of construction in 2006. The port was then managed by a Singaporean government entity. In 2013 a Chinese port operator took over from the Singaporeans. In 2015 China announced that it will expand the port as part of the CPEC initiative. But five years later little has happened. When you look out at the port you can see it has only three births and all of them were empty. And the only ship that was in the port at the time was a Pakistan naval forget. And so it indicated to me that the port is not particularly operational for commercial purposes. And a number of analysts have talked about the strategic importance in a military sense. If eventually China were able to use the port of Guadar as a military base. No one would be surprised if China did use it in that way. I don't think in the short term like it is set up in Djibouti where it has a permanent base. I think it's more likely to use it as almost like a sort of forward base to resupply option. Something it can use when it wants to. Other projects like building Pakistan's largest airport in Guadar and two special economic zones have been delayed. A 19 kilometre highway linking the port with the Macarang Coastal Highway in Balochistan is under construction too. Most of the people who live there and work there already are fishermen. They rely on...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1697,2022-11-22 01:54:49
19084," Most of the people who lived there and worked there already are fishermen. They rely on access to the sea. The way that the express highway from the port was originally proposed would have cut off their sea access. And so that was a real point of contention with the community. There have been some proposals to allow them at underpass. It's still a little bit unclear how that is finally going to be resolved. Even if those projects are eventually built, there are serious questions about who will work there. There is a problem with manpower, of course, in Guadar. It's a very small city. And so one proposal has been well, we'll just ship Chinese workers in from China and build lots of fancy housing for them. The first Chinese-built community in Pakistan, a 500 million dollar development spanning over 10 million square feet with over 60% open spaces. That kind of proposal is what makes a lot of the Pakistani local people quite upset. A Guadal-based journalist expressed concerns to Bloomberg over projects like this. The journalist spoke anonymously for fear of persecution from the Pakistan government. These projects are creating jobs, but they're not really creating jobs for the local people of Guadar. They're not against economic prosperity, but they're against the development that leads them behind. Pakistan doesn't have the money to build these projects. It's gone to the IMF for its 13th bailout since the 1980s. By engaging in CPEC projects, the government of Pakistan has incurred more debts from China. Not only posing challenges for Pakistan, but possibly the international community if Pakistan eventually defaults on its debts. But CPEC is still set to go on. Even if most current projects haven't been completed, the two countries have recently signed new projects worth $11 billion. Pakistan's Prime Minister said the country's economic future is linked with China. It's hard to imagine how the China-Pakistan economic corridor is going to be the game changer that the Pakistan government would like it to be. We're not seeing the economic growth or benefit from the projects that were set out and were supposed to have seen by now. We're not seeing the job creation. Project delays, accumulating debts, commercial viability. These problems of CPEC are also typical of Belt and Road projects around the world. For China, though, it's never the narrow accounting perspective that matters. It's the bigger strategic benefits. As China's dollars continue to flow, as China's concrete continues to pour, China's influence continues to increase. There was some degree of runaway expectations. I think there was also some degree that they weren't extremely forthcoming with the state of the game.

19085," Where's my gun? Trans, keep her steady. I can't shoot. The release of Cyberpunk 2077 in December of 2020 will go down as one of the most disastrous game launches in history, and it instantly rewrote the narrative of its celebrated developer, CD Projekt Red. Larger studios with bigger budgets weren't able to create the same quality of open-world game. The inside story of the making of Cyberpunk depicts a process marred by unchecked ambition, unrealistic timelines, and a focus on marketing and the expensive development. When CD Projekt stock was at its high, it was the largest stock in the Polish stock market. Cyberpunk was supposed to be the biggest game of 2020. This was a game that was starring Keanu Reeves. This is a game that was from the makers of the Witcher 3. This was supposed to be the big temple release of last year, and for it to become such a disaster for so many people, I think, will have pretty far-reaching consequences. CD Projekt's origins are somewhat unique in the game's industry. In the West and Japan, the late 80s and 90s were dominated by games through the home console market, and characters like Mario and Sonic the Hedgehog were becoming household names. The same was not true in a post-Soviet and economically depressed Poland. Most games were done on PCs, and most games were copied and sold in small markets around the country. You could go to the market down the street in Warsaw and buy in cell CDs, and these two guys, Marchiniewinsky and Michal Kaczynski, decided they were going to start selling CDs, and they wound up striking a deal with the people who made a game called Baldur's Gate, which is like the seminal role-playing game in the late 90s. CD Projekt, named for selling CDs, would move on from just reselling games to localizing Western and Japanese made games into the Polish language, but it wasn't until 2002 that the company would make its own game, The Witcher. The Witcher is a huge, huge series, huge fantasy series in Poland, and so it was a pretty big deal that these guys got the race to make the video games. The Witcher book series is a source of national pride in Poland, and a CD project released The Witcher 2. The video game series would become an important economic symbol for Poland as well. CD Projekt Greta had become this behemoth of an institution in Poland, and they were really big in the Polish technology scene because they were getting more worldwide attention than most Polish companies do, and making a lot of money. And in 2011, when Barack Obama came to visit Poland, the Prime Minister actually gave him a copy of The Witcher 2. I confess I'm not very good at video games, but I've been told that it is a great example of Poland's place in the new global economy. But it would be The Launch of The Witcher 3 in 2015 that would elevate CD Projekt Red from representing the best of Poland to representing the best of the game's industry. I mean really the thing people look for first and foremost I think is that the game is just good, and Witcher 3 was just a phenomenal game. There's a level of just storytelling, an emphasis on making every side quest count. On top of the atmosphere, the dialogue, the character interactions, the different way stories can end. They nail that. Other open world games felt empty and forced, and the developers of them gave excuses as to why there couldn't be more rich story or interactions. And The Witcher 3 blew them out of the water. CD Projekt Red was beloved. They were seen as a studio that was willing to make what the player wanted, and to truly put in the love and effort required to make a high...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1699,2022-11-22 02:03:36
19086," Believed. They were seen as a studio that was willing to make what the player wanted and to truly put in the love and effort required to make a high quality game that really connects with the people playing with it. And the winner for Game of the Year 2015 is The Witcher 3. The Witcher 3 would go into an over 250 game of the year awards, but along with being a critical success for CD Projekt who is also a financial success. Estimates put the sales of Witcher 3 at around 28 million copies in 2019. A huge step up considering by 2014 The Witcher and The Witcher 2 had only combined to sell 8 million copies. And with two large expansions for The Witcher 3, CD Projekt also helped separate themselves from other AAA publishers at the time. And the game award goes, oh man, I have to pay a micro transaction to unlock. That's so stupid that this has to hold on. I got this guys. Here we go. Other games and the most notorious one to do this was EA's Star Wars Battlefront 2. They got really aggressive on micro transactions in a game that already cost at least $60. You could have paid more if you bought premium editions, but not only was it that they were being very aggressive and trying to get you to spend money, but you could actually get items that helped you win. Well, gamers kind of draw the line in the sand there, and they don't like them. CD Projekt had done this phenomenal job of marketing themselves as a gamer friendly company. We've said this a million times, and I'll say it again, word gamers first of all, and we all like to be treated fairly. So it only makes sense that as developers, we apply the same principle to everything we do here at CD Projekt Red. So giving everyone a bunch of free DLC was an absolutely no brainer. They said, we're not going to sell you DLC that's like horse armor packs and other nonsense. We're going to just give you a free stuff and then we're going to sell big expansions as part of The Witcher 3. And not only were they really good, they were offered at a fair price. And this is a company that was seen as just like a company that really cared about quality and cared about its customers, and we're not doing anything to kind of screw fans over the way that that fans see that EA and Activision and all the other big publishers feel. With a critically and financially successful game, as well as the goodwill from the gaming audience, all the focus would shift to CD Projekt's next release, Cyberpunk 2077. It's actually funny, they first announced it through like a press release. And then they showed off a trailer of the beginning of 2013 that was like the CGI trailer of like a woman and there was all sorts of cool cyberpunk stuff flying cars lots of stuff. But it wasn't really until after The Witcher 3 that Cyberpunk began really like building up this fever level of hype. CD Projekt Red though wouldn't put out another trailer for Cyberpunk until 2018 at the E3 trade show. And they showed off a, it was like a two minute trailer of Cyberpunk. Look pretty rad. And then they showed behind the scenes for E3 attendees for press and anyone else who could get a score and appointment in there. They showed this 45 minute demo and it blew people away. Welcome to the gameplay demo walkthrough of CD Projekt Red's upcoming title. The gameplay are about...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1700,2022-11-22 02:07:46
19087," Welcome to the gameplay demo walkthrough of CD Projekt Red's upcoming title, Cyberpunk 2077. The gameplay you're about to see is from a work in progress version of the game. Everything you see is potentially subject to change. Holy f***ing f***ing. This if they can live up to what they showed me, it's game over. It all looked incredibly impressive. They had enough action, enough narrative beats with just the right amount of tension. They touted how each of these NPCs, their thousands of them, each one with their own daily routines and everything. We've greatly enhanced our crowd and community system to create the most believable city in any open world games to do. So yeah, so people were certainly blown away by the demo at 23 awards and just people left the theater just in awe. What they didn't know of course is that the demo was completely fake. Fake demos are common at E3. Studios put together builds of games to show off what they tend the game to be like rather than the actual state of the game. What was unique about this demo was that it was impressively long. It kind of plays into this idea that CD Projekt is very much a market and driven company and so demos were really, really important to them. So it was really important that they make the demo blow people away, which it did, but that might have come to the cost of like some time they could have been spending on the game. A year later at E3 2019, fans would get another big surprise. Whoa, no way! You're a breathtaking. The cyberpunk trailers showed gorgeous cities, beautiful lighting, really cutting edge technology when it comes to the rendering of the game itself. Before it was very excited to be immersed in this gorgeous cyberpunk world, they saw over 8 million pre-orders, which is a ridiculously large amount for any title to sell, let alone pre-sell. And you saw the stock price start to go up and up and up and up into the right, pretty much in a straight line. If you just look at the polished stock market, like the Wig Index, when CD Projekt stock was at its high, it was the largest stock in the index. And that was around the time that they announced that the game would be coming in April of 2020. Behind the Seaheens, people were pretty shocked that they were saying April. I don't think a single person who worked on that game actually thought they had a chance of coming out in April of 2020. So in April of 2019, I published an article for Kotaku about the making of a game called Anthem, which is a game from Byware that was disastrous in many ways and the article kind of ran through why that was. Afterwards, I started hearing from other developers who had stories to share that they said sounded a whole lot like Anthem. The deadline is unrealistic, the direction keeps changing, things are floundering, we're going through a lot of problems. This sounds exactly like what you wrote about Anthem. Around that same time, perhaps coincidentally, I heard from VCEO of CD Projekt Red who wanted to reach out to me specifically to talk about Crunch. CD Projekt Red had a reputation for Crunch, especially during the development of Witcher 3. Their management wanted them to have a reputation for training workers well and not forcing them to go through Crunch. So Marchinevinsky, who is a co-founder and co-CEO of CD Projekt Red, came to me and said, hey, I want to make a vow right now that we're not going to force anybody to Crunch, that people will not have to work mandatory overtime on this project. Over the course of reporting, Bloomberg has conducted interviews with more than 20 current and former CD Projekt staff, most of whom requested anonymity so as not to risk their careers. CD Projekt declined a comment on the process or provide interviews with the story.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1701,2022-11-22 02:12:14
19088," Homer's CD Project staff, most of whom requested anonymity, so as not to risk their careers. CD Project declined a comment on the process, or provide interviews with the story. The company would end up delaying the game three different times, first pushing from an April 2020 release to September, then November, and once again to December 2020. In order to meet the deadline, the studio would scale down the size of Cyberpunk's main city, as well as canceling some features, and while those measures helped, developers still said they were under significant crunch, including one former audio programmer who claimed to work up to 13 hours a day, five days a week, and stating he had seen friends who had lost their families over this. This was not a big secret in the office that the game was not going to be ready, but a similar sort of thing happened with Witcher 3, and a similar sort of thing happens with a lot of games, where they don't seem ready until suddenly everything just clicks. Some of the best games ever made, like were created through this process. I don't know that it's the most efficient or the wisest way to make video games, but it's what a lot of people do. I think that management there has genuinely tried to change it, or at least said they wanted to change it, but it has proven very difficult to change that when you make games in this one specific way. Game studios, some of them see crunch as part of their core culture, that all of their games that they've made under crunch have been successful, so it must be a core element to the magic recipe for creating good games. And that's really not the case. We've run studies and seen that at eight weeks of working 60 hours plus, the output of a professional is the same as if they were working 40 hours a week, so chronic overwork degrades how effective someone is to the point where then it becomes negative, and overworking them is just getting new less and less productivity. And so these guys, the People at CD Projekt, having made the Witcher 3, we're kind of riding on that high, you could call it arrogance or confidence, or whenever you want to call it, of having made the Witcher 3, and I think that like having a certain level confidence can certainly be a good thing, but in this case it could also be dangerous because it kind of blinded them to the reality, which was that this game wasn't going to call us. Sony Pictures Entertainment is reeling from what may be the biggest and most devastating computer hacking in Hollywood's history. Sony pulling the plug on the interview, saying it will not show the controversial comedy about an assassination attempt on North Korea's leader. The Justice Department has charged three North Korean hackers over a wide ranging scheme that included the attempt theft of billions of dollars for multiple companies.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1702,2022-11-22 02:16:24
19089," dollars for multiple companies. Despite so many attacks blamed on North Korea, there was not much known about the people behind the hacking attacks. And my aim was to reveal who these people are and what they are like, what their operations are like, and on what their dreams and fears were. My name is Sam Kim. I'm a reporter for Blue Mug News, and I wrote a story for Business Week about North Gun hackers. My story is about people who are sent from North Korea to countries like China, to hack for the regime, spy on enemies, and make money. North Korea's cyber abilities began about in the 1970s with a lot of students going to countries like Russia, China, and even East Germany to learn coding, it was aimed at improving the productivity of factories at home. But in some time in the 1980s and 1990s, the current leader Kim Jong-un's father, Kim Jong-un, thought that it would be a good idea to develop a team, an army of people who could hack for North Korea's military. So they began this team of hackers who would spy for the North Gun regime and also go out there and make hard currency for the regime. I think Kim Jong-un takes the hacking ability more seriously than his father. He also enjoys a bit of tech sadness as well. He's often shown traveling on his airplane where on the desk there's a Mac computer. He understands the importance of computers. He understands the importance of employing technology to improve productivity of his economy. North Korea is an isolated country with its economy pretty much dilapidated nowadays. It's been under increasing pressure and sanctions from the US and the international community basically. It does not have the resources and money to build a kind of conventional weapons that other countries are able to build. So what happens is North Korea concentrates its resources on building nuclear arms and missiles which exports coal basically a symmetrical weapons. It's the kind of weapons that gives North Korea an instant edge. Think of cyber hacking abilities in that context. It doesn't cost them much money. But if you have the right people and if you have the right training, you are able to cultivate an army of people who are able to penetrate into computer systems of other countries. And that's what North Korea is after. But if you consider the fact that there are only about a thousand IP addresses in North Korea available and many of them are basically loaned from Chinese communications companies, you can kind of tell why North Korea is willing to send its hackers abroad rather than operate from within. What's the matter with operating from within? Well, first of all, it would mean that a lot of information would have to be coming in from the outside world which could risk exposing the government and the people to whatever truth there might be about them. So they're sending their trained hackers to China and other countries where access to information is better. But at the same time, because these are allies and also because they have their diplomats stationed in countries like these like China, they're able to regulate and control these hackers better. But formally, North Korea denies engaging in hacking and described accusations to that",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1703,2022-11-22 02:20:47
19090," To regulate and control these hackers better, but formally North Korea denies engaging in hacking and describes accusations to that affect as enemy propaganda. It took me at least half a year to track down these people. It felt like a wild goose chase in the beginning, because see a lot of the people like these are protected by the government in South Korea. But at the end, I was able to find a person who had pretty extensive ties to the North Korean defective community here. And then I was also able to gain access to the people who had actually done programming hacking from North Korea before coming to South Korea. And Jung is one of them. Jung is not a real name. I knew before meeting Jung that he was in his late 30s. But when I actually met him, he looked at the decade older. He wouldn't open up. I mean, it took me at least an hour to make sure that he would trust me enough that he would share with me his life story. When he was first sent to China, he was a studio studying computer science at a university near the border with North Korea. And he came back and realized that there was a lot more to do in China because he had more access to information. And he asked that he'd be sent back to China. And there was also recruitment going on for people who would actually do coding officially, but really hacking from North Korea. So he applied and he got the job. Once he got to the border, he crossed by foot and from there, he took a bus. And then when he arrived at the station that he would spend years in later, he learned that that three-story building in the heart of a city was actually provided for free, actually, by a Chinese man who had business ties in North Korea. They were actually two other people that I had met. They all said that they go on to this freelance website for programmers and clients from around the world would come and give them orders, give them jobs to do. Some of the jobs given to Jung were cracking open, commercially successful anti-virus programs. And once he was able to open that up, he replicated that program into another product which his client would repackage as a whole different product to be sold to other people. He also created what we now call bots. They are very popular online games including lineage. He would create a bot that would just roam around without any supervision from the user and basically trade items without a user on that game. He would grow that bot on lineage and sell it for almost $100. Another defector said the money from clients was primarily via PayPal to accounts controlled by minors because they were the only ones with access to legitimate bank accounts. Jung had to make at least $100,000 in a year and he doesn't get to keep most of it. Actually, most of the money goes to minors to the North Korean regime. But if you don't meet the quota and the minors will make sure that they'll put enough pressure on you. And if that happens repeatedly, you will face the growing odds of being sent back home. Among the three people that I spoke to, there's a common thing that they all tell me which is that on every Saturday they have to do this propaganda session which is basically about gathering all the hackers together into a room and they have to recite whatever messages, whatever lines come from Pyongyang about the Kim family, about socialism. If you're especially someone with a free set of mind, that's stressful. And one person actually was really stressed out what he heard about North Korea.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1704,2022-11-22 02:25:10
19091," Especially someone with a free set of mind that's stressful. One person actually was really stressed out what he heard about North Korea. Once he was in China, he was in the propaganda assistance. He just couldn't take it. Jung was a senior member of the unit that he belonged to and he was good at Chinese as well. Whenever a senior North Korean official came from North Korea to check on the hacking units in China, Jung would accompany that official. He doesn't provide me details, but he calls it unsavory incident that happened between him and an official that he was traveling with. And that altercation prompted him to defect. But there was no one that he could turn to after defecting. He would, in disguise, roam around China. He called me that he actually enjoyed it. He actually enjoyed the freedom of not being known to anybody. He was just roaming around a country that was huge. How did he make the money that he needed to carry on? He did the same thing he did at the North Korean unit. He would take orders, reverse engineer software to make money. But at one point, he said he was just sick and tired of it all the sudden. He wanted to find a place where he could just settle down and he contacted South Korean authorities. Now, he lives in Korea. He met a woman here. Last time I checked the head of a baby, he worked for a software company, ironically, an antivirus company. What keeps coming up in my head, even long after I spoke to these people, is there was one common thing about them, which was the sense of disillusionment. One day had access to outside information. One day, we were able to freely roam in the Internet. There was a spark. And once they realized that there's a discrepancy between what they think is really happening and what North Korea is telling them every Saturday morning, that's when the spark gets bigger. Their little fire is what eventually drives them to decide to leave, even if it takes a huge risk on their lives.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1705,2022-11-22 02:29:59
19092,"again Since they started popping up in the 1950s, malls have been the quintessential American shopping experience. Useling temples dedicated to the wonders and excesses of retail, food service and entertainment, the rise of the mall coincided with the growth of the suburbs. The heyday of the malls really is the 1970s, sometimes referred to as the malling of America. They really thrived at providing some sort of public gathering space, some sort of social life in addition to actually giving people places to shop. Over the past few decades before then, lots of developers were building malls and it kind of coincided with the growth of highways. So as more people started traveling and interstate started being built, developers really wanted to put something to attract people to stop. Take a look at an average American mall today, however, and you'll see a very different picture. Closed stores and empty hallways became the norm in many malls even before COVID-19 delivered them another set of problems in 2020. So what happened? This is the story of the rise and fall of American malls. When malls work best, they survived and thrived thanks to their anchor stores. Those are the stores that are on the edges of the malls and that are outward facing to the parking lot. So if you're a shopper, you're going to walk through one of these big, usually a department store. So if you're thinking about maces or sears or jc penny, those are called the anchor stores. So once shoppers are done shopping there, maybe they wander to the middle part of the mall, shopping at the other apparel shops or even going to buy some food, but you really have to have a reason for people to shop in the first place. Because anchors bring in all those people, they tend to pay very little rent. Around 80% of income from mall owners come from the inline stores inside the mall. Over the past few decades, malls have been facing challenges from all sides. The first being, there's just too many of them. As early as in the 90s, the malls were beginning to compete with each other. We have a lot more retail square footage per capita than Canada. We have only seven times more retail square footage per capita than Europe. After the 2008 financial crisis lowered retail spending across the board, malls and especially their department stores also had to contend with a new challenge that was growing fast. malls started to suffer in the early 2000s with the rise of online shopping. Suddenly, they didn't have that captive audience who had to go to the mall to buy something. You didn't have to get up, get in your car, drive all the way to the mall and then see a bunch of other people. You can just do it from the comfort of your own. Department stores overall have become less relevant over the years. Many have fallen totally off and that's Sears, JC Penny. Several bankruptcies in this space have really hurt the industry. But as department stores go, so does the mall oftentimes. So if department stores start closing locations, that means they're usually leaving malls. This is the Green Briar Mall in Southwest Atlanta, Georgia. It's in many ways emblematic of the project.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1706,2022-11-22 02:34:01
19093," This is the Green Briar Mall in Southwest Atlanta, Georgia. It's in many ways emblematic of the problems facing malls today. It's been there since 1965, so for more than half of a century, it's been serving this area of Atlanta that's predominantly black and also as middle class neighborhood. It started with anchor stores that were department stores, so you had JC Penny and then Riches, which was later bought by Macy's. So you had these two national chains. It had the first Chick-fil-A in a mall, like that type of format. So when you think about the history of malls, like Green Briar had like the perfect template, but now Macy's will be exiting the mall, meaning that the mall will be left without an anchor, which is vital to attracting other shoppers to come into the stores. Green Briar then because it's kind of an example or a test for all these other middleing malls across America about what do you do when these large department stores as a business decision on their end are trying to just stay in the high quality malls? How does a middleing mall survive? What's their next strategy? Music Green Briar is a textbook example of how closely the deterioration of the middle class in the US is tied to the health of its malls. The median income for the surrounding area has reduced by $6,905 over the past 15 years to a total of $20,756 per year. And yet, residents and store owners hope that Green Briar mall will see better days. Malls are made up of the people and communities that help fuel them. Green Briar is still a place that people go to and cherish, even if on paper it doesn't have the elements that make it a thriving mall. A lot of the existing constituents and residents there feel in many respects that they worked hard their whole lives to be able to experience the American dream. The single family suburb in house in a leafy yard near a big mall that had a great NACs that they're very reluctant to see that taken away from them. Now that Macy's is gone, Green Briar may try to take inspiration from what many malls were doing in the years following the financial crisis, focusing not on shopping but experiences. That was a trend we were seeing in 2016 up into the pandemic pretty much. And by experiences I mean everything as dramatic as a water park or hosting concerts to have people want to come other than just to buy stuff. Having Instagramable moments, making sure your store is pretty that people want to take a photo and post it on Instagram or Twitter. Historically the mall has always been a place for teenagers. You like to hang out, see your friends and also kind of be seen at the mall. And that hasn't completely changed like before the pandemic, about 95% of Gen Zs. So today's teenagers had gone to a mall in a three month period. So teenagers are still going to the mall and they've always been key to having thriving malls because they're coming into their spending power. And once you win over teens, hopefully you're really winning over a loyal customer for life. But thanks to lockdowns across the country, most malls at one point or another were shuttered in 2020. That means no one.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1707,2022-11-22 02:38:06
19094," But thanks to lockdowns across the country, most malls at one point or another were shuttered in 2020. That means no one using the multi-billion dollar American Dream malls indoor ski slope. No one going to the king of Prussia malls indoor skydiving attraction. Basically, the pandemic gave malls what they didn't need, another problem. What would your net income or net operating income have been in 2022 without COVID and what is it now in a post-COVID world? So our views is roughly 10% hit to net income over that period. That's Vince Taboni from the analytics from Green Street Advisors, which rates American malls from A to D just like a report card. And if malls did have a report card they wouldn't exactly make honor roll. During the US, out of the thousand malls in the country there are roughly 250 malls, we grade A minus or better. The B and C quality malls, which is the vast majority of the malls by count, we think are on a negative trajectory. And it's going to depend on a lot of the local dynamics, ownership, decisions around how much money to invest in the property. We'll determine whether this mall can survive as retail or rapidly melting ice cube. While there have been a few bankruptcies among real estate investment trusts that own mostly B to D malls in the past few years, A malls really are doing just fine. Some of the most productive shopping centers in the country are super high-end. So I'm talking about bowel harbor shops down in Miami, Florida. There is Americana man has it in Long Island's Gold Coast, the Grove in Los Angeles. These are places that have all high-end stores and have done quite well. A lot of that has to do with efficiency of their property, so their sales per square foot are really high. But also they've invested a lot in their actual mall, because it has to look beautiful. It has to have all the services that a wealthy shopper expects. So what will the future hold for less sought-after malls that can't revive their golden years? For many of these malls, it will mean closure and then hopefully conversion. If they can't get a new use to come in, it's expensive, but you can just demolish it. And there are still quite a lot of sites just sitting waiting. Amazon has been picking up more and more of those building their big fulfillment centers. Also, a lot of communities think this is an opportunity to redevelop, re-enhabit this dead mall. To help that community meet the challenges it was never originally designed for. The number one reuse of an existing mall is as workspace. It's actually pretty easy to just throw some carpeting down, cut a few more windows, and turn it into office space. The number two reuse of malls is either medical, healthcare, or education. Lots of great examples of community colleges all the way down to elementary schools. Moving into malls. Then the third strategy that I wish happened more is actually just demolishing the mall and re-greening. Either reconstructing the wetlands that used to be there and that frankly we never should have built on in the first place, or providing community parks and gardens. While most analysts say post-pandemic retail shopping could breathe some life back into the American mall, many are not long for this world. Depending on where you live it might be time to make one last visit, grab some food, do some shopping, and say farewell.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1708,2022-11-22 02:42:39
19095,"pers— President Trump traveled to Utah today where he dramatically cut back the size of two national monuments in that state. When former President Donald Trump announced plans to scale back two national monuments in Utah, there was outcry from a lot of people. One company in particular. Patagonia really is a resistance brand. They embraced the liberal resistance against President Donald Trump and really put themselves at the forefront of that movement. In 2017, it sued the Trump administration for sort of slashing the size of these two national monuments in Utah that were kind of mechas for climbers. The set at the time, joining the legal fracas was both extraordinary and obvious. The company's general counsel said it took exactly one email to the board to decide to actually do that. I send the cases still out. Well, I think the only thing this administration understands is lawsuits. We're losing this planet. And we have an evil government. And I'm not going to stand back and just let evil win. This year got even more active, it changed its mission statement to quote, Patagonia isn't business to save our home planet. And then it manufactured these little tags on some of its clothes that if you flip them up, it says, vote the assholes out. Very implicit running up to the election. And it launched a digital tool to help people find the polling place. And on that digital platform, it says, vote the climate deniers out of office again and again on the loop. This isn't the first time that taking a stand has paid off the Patagonia. The business which is now worth over a billion dollars was built on it. I couldn't care less about making more money. But by doing the right thing, it always ends up making more money. So is this all a strategy, a sort of premeditated strategy? Who knows? I mean, Sean Arts has been very vocal from the start and makes no bones about. He calls himself a dirt bad climber and an accidental entrepreneur. So I don't think he's fudging this, but what's important is that it's sort of a textbook marriage of philanthropy and profit. If you want to understand the entrepreneur's study that juvenile delinquent, because, you know, they're saying, you know, this sucks. And I'm going to do it my own way. Of course, like every other teenage kid, I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life.

19096," MUSIC Patagonia was born out of Rockclimate Avant-Schumard's first business, Schuwenart Equipment, which made and sold climbing supplies. Avant-Schumard was a blacksmith in the 50s, and he started selling climbing gear out of the back of his car. That was less harmful to rock faces. This is sort of the origin story of the company. It's called itself the activist company, a activist company. MUSIC Six months out of the year, Avant-Schumard is a blacksmith. He makes mountain climbing gear. The other half of the year he climbs. MUSIC In 1968, Avant-Schumard and four friends, including Doug Tomkins, the late founders of the North Face brand, embarked on the ultimate road trip from California where they were based to Patagonia in Argentina. MUSIC The mountains in a good mood, dazzling sun, calmer all day. If this weather holds, they could be on the summit within days. MUSIC This trip became a documentary about these friends who were hippies in the 70s climbing in Yosemite, where the sport became a lifestyle. And how these friends became pioneer of the outdoor industry. MUSIC Schuannard moved from selling petons to polyester, and in the 70s Patagonia was born. In 1973, Schuannard and his wife Melinda opened the very first Patagonia store in Ventura, California, where the companies had quarters remained today. Melinda Schuannard was the driving force behind many of the employee benefits, like on-site childcare, that helped the company achieve an impressive 4% employee turnover rate. The retail and consumer product sector average is more than triple that at 13%. MUSIC I do think that Patagonia was a leader, one of the first corporations to take into account, you know, the human capital, and make sure that their staff, all their employees were cared for in many ways, not just wages, but also they just cared about their people. And knew that that's a good business model. MUSIC Patagonia began donating 10% of its profits to grassroots organizations in 1985. This later became the 1% of sales that Schuannard labels and Earth tax. MUSIC I don't think it's for land free. I'm trying to grant for us living on this planet. While Patagonia was creating the blueprint of how to be a socially conscious brand, it was also turning a profit. It even made Ink Magazine's list of the fastest growing privately held companies. So every time the company makes a decision to do something socially environmentally active, it is met with success, and that isn't lost on Schuannard or any of the other leaders of the company. The more money Patagonia made, the more it gave away under its philanthropic program. Between 1989 and 1991, the payroll grew by 40%. But trouble was on the horizon. I think for 1991, we are looking at a recession. The question is how deep that recession is going to be and how long will be in it. Sales fell flat and the bank called in the company's revolving loans. A company that prided itself on taking care of its own laid off 120 people, roughly 20% of its workforce. That was when we decided that we were going to start doing things differently. And we're going to start running the company as if it's going to be here 100 years. With a renewed sense of purpose, Patagonia was ready for what it called business unusual. It started with the costly move to recycle an organic materials before launching a clothing repair service to discourage fast fashion. And Patagonia's influence was growing. What was intended as Schuannard's philosophical handbook for employees became an international blueprint for sustainable business printed in ten languages. What's interesting to me is that all this, I hate this.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1710,2022-11-22 02:51:13
19097," What's interesting to me is that all this, I hate the term on brand, but it's very on brand. It really works for the kind of companies created. It works for the kind of employees he's been able to recruit and retain. It all is very seamless in terms of the identity of him and the company and what it means in the marketplace. So over time, the company's mission and its marketing have become the same thing. The inflection point came in 2011, actually Black Friday, Patagonia took out a huge ad in the New York Times that said, don't buy this jacket. And it's sort of got into the nitty-gritty on the carbon footprint and the water footprint that goes into a piece of a peril like a parca. And at the time, Seanard said, the best jacket for our planet is one that already exists. So the company at that time said it needed to address the issue of consumerism, which coming from a for-profit business hits pretty hypercritical. As the company encouraged its customers to buy less, its annual sales increased by almost 40%. The stance on this is hypercritical is loud and constant talking about consumerism in a critical light while very much being a part of it. Fast fashion is top on the list of environmental destruction and not just destroying the environment but impacting human health. They are in the fashion industry, they're a clothing retailer, and to come head-to-head with that is courageous. You're not only just trying to create a product that'll last, but you're also educating an entire generation of people to understand that whole ideology that you don't need to change out our outfits. In 2014, Rose Macaria was appointed as CEO. During the next six years, she grew Patagonia into a billion-dollar company, while also scaling up its environmental goals and bringing a more political voice to its activism. Ivana had this model where he was basically saying, you can have a great business, you can make quality product, but you can also do the right thing by the environment, by your employees, by your community. And that, to me, was like the most holistic vision of business that I'd ever seen. So right now, Patagonia has a team of about 20 people solely focused on activism and grants. And this all comes at a time in the past decade when consumers are paying much more attention to the social footprint of companies and where they buy their goods. So what's happened is all this is good business for Patagonia in the past 10 years, revenue and profit at the company of roughly quadruple. It's private, but estimates are it does about a billion dollars in annual sales, which is sizable. And that's part of the reason why it's been such a fortuitous cycle as it's ramped up its activism and become more vocal on these things. It's resonated with the market. As the company branched out into other areas, including a venture capital fund for environmental causes and sustainable food, revenue reached a new peak of over $1 billion in 2017. But this was still small change compared to fast fashion heavywaste like Nike, who made $37 billion that same year. Patagonia's conscience hasn't always been reflected in its customer base either. Personalized vests have become the go-to corporate uniform. And the expensive price tag has helped the brand earn the nickname Patagonia. It's expensive stuff, it's expensive apparel, and that is part of their calculus in terms of the activism, you know, a lot of the more sustainable parts of this pie chain art. There's a premium for organic cotton or sustainable down. The Patagucci label is a symptom of that. So Patagonia products are very popular. Of course, with people who are active in the outdoors, but also with people who are not as active. For instance, you know, people in finance where the Patagonia vests go to the office. That's because...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1711,2022-11-22 02:55:38
19098," go and finance where the Patagonia vests go to the office. And that's because of the image that the brand projects. And so they have to be with the fact, although they preach for the environment and want to stand for good, they're victims of their own success. Patagonia set sales records in the first three years of the Trump administration. Now, in 2020, things have changed. His COVID-19 brought the business world to a halt, and the American people voted in a new administration. Patagonia, a point of Brian Gellert as CEO. As far as its CEO transition goes, this one's happening quite strangely. There's no real budget for next year yet, because of everything that's going on and all the uncertainty around that. Patagonia's new focus is going to be on forging a relationship with the Biden administration. It should be a more close relationship, but Gellert still has his guard up. During the Obama administration, they didn't always agree, and he expects the same with Biden in the White House. They plan to bring litigation wherever needed against any government needed about the issues that they care about, and that's climate change in the environment. chooses to raise our rights within itself as a country.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1712,2022-11-22 03:00:45
19099," Okay, you built this. So this is all. This is new since the pandemic. We assume Googlers would want more indoor outdoor options. I mean, it's so exciting. It's such a fun... It is. It is. But I would say the thing we're really excited about are these new buildings because we were building sustainability into everything we do. So really forward-looking. More? More? Good? Okay. From one of the newest workspaces at the Googleplex in Mountain View, California, this is Bloomberg Studio 1.0 with Alphabet CFO, Ruth Porat. We're not far from her childhood home. Her father was a physicist at Stanford, her mother, a psychologist. She graduated from Stanford herself and then earning a couple more advanced degrees. Porat landed her first job on Wall Street in 1987, where she would spend almost three decades until Google's co-founders lured her to Silicon Valley. It's wonderful to be here with you. It's great to have you here at the Googleplex. Thank you for having us. So we are at Google headquarters in Mountain View and at this very same time you are making massive investments in New York office real estate. You're expanding headcount in Atlanta and Chicago and Washington, DC. What's the strategy behind all of this? Well, at the core we believe in hybrid work. So we do want to bring people back on campuses, but not full-time. We're thinking it would probably be a three to work week, but we think coming together is just such a core part of innovation, serendipity, culture, every element of it. And we're growing in a really rapid clip. So we are excited to be expanding our real estate footprint. And then we also wanted to make sure that we're meeting people where they want to be. And so enlarging the number of sites that we have available for people in particular sites where you have great diverse populations. Sundar just told me that Googlers will have this option to work in a hybrid mode forever, like literally forever. Obviously, you're embracing this massive cultural shift. But what are the risks? What do you worry about? So the positive we've seen is there's a productivity uplift we believe in giving people the opportunity to be at home some of the time, not do the commute, be able to deal with everything else in their life, and coming into the office. So the risk is, I think, about my career, and so much of the benefit in my career was the informal.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1713,2022-11-22 03:04:39
19100," And coming into the office. So the risk is, I think, about my career, and so much of the benefit in my career was the informal coaching being pot-pronented meetings, all of the touch points that you have. And so I think that one of the most important things for all of us as leaders is we need to evolve the way we lead. We need to make sure that we're thinking about this hybrid work life and why that's the way to be the best magnet for talent and make sure that we're continuing to reinforce all of those great practices while opening up new great practices. Speaking of your career, before you were CFO of AlphaBat, you were CFO of Morgan Stanley. And you started your career on Wall Street in 1987. Talk to us about the journey of going from big banks to big tech. Why did you make that leap? And what impact did you want to have? Well, I love doing it Morgan Stanley. And I became CFO the day James Gorman became CEO, we asked me to join him in that journey. And that was January 2010. And we were still recovering coming out of the financial crisis. There were still some pretty rocky days and a lot of decisions that needed to be made. And then I got to a point where I felt like we were in a great spot at Morgan Stanley. And obviously, it's continued to do really well. And I just wanted that next chapter. On my view, in my career, I've always been focused on continually learning. And I feel like when you hit a plateau, the right questions, that's my highest and best use. And it's been an extraordinary time. You also survived Wall Street in the 80s and 90s, which is notorious Boyz Club. And Silicon Valley has sort of come to be known as a Boyz Club of its own. How would you compare those two cultures? Well, when I was starting my career many decades ago, it was tough and much worse than it is now. And it evolved. No question about it. Not where it needs to be. But certainly evolved. And I saw it through my career. I would say the biggest difference out here is the level of impatience. And I love it. As the view is, if you can do some of the extraordinary breakthroughs that we have out here, if you can do natural language translation, everything we do with AI, with VR, with self-driving cars, why can't you fix this now? And that level of impatience, I think, is fantastic. Legend has it that when you got to Google, you were going to rain in the spending, tighten up on the moon shots. Your nickname, I believe, was Ruth Vader. Was that a tough job to take on? So I think the narrative was written before I got here. And what I find most interesting about that is I firmly believe the single most important thing in capital allocation is investing for long-term growth. I think if you don't, you are sowing the seeds of your long-term decline. And I learned that really early on in my career. Now, if you're investing in an industry like this and trying to do truly transformative things, by definition, everything can't succeed. And so by definition, you should have the metrics and data and milestones to assess, is it working or is it not? Because if everything's working, or if you think everything's working, I would say one or two things are wrong. Either you're not reaching high enough, or you're not being honest enough with yourself about the pace of breakthrough, whether you're going to get there. So to me, a really natural part, kind of a sister organization to investing for long-term growth, is actually thinking about how are you doing with the risk that you're taking, stack, rack them, and figure out what's at the bottom so you can redeploy those resources to the top. They go together, actually. And so I find the narrative. It's a false choice to think that it's either about growth or it's about pruning, stack ranking. They go together. And you have to think of them as actually empowering one another. You advised the Treasury Department during the great recession. What lessons did you take away from that? What struck me is a lot of the lessons from the financial crisis are relevant in good times and bad times. So the most important is it's easier to prevent than to fix. And so that was really clear during the financial crisis. The financial crisis was about liquidity, and it dried up quickly. And it would have been really easy six to 12 months prior to build a interable liquidity. You couldn't do it in the moment. And so this notion about really building a solid foundation.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1714,2022-11-22 03:08:49
19101," And it would have been really easy six to 12 months prior to build indurable liquidity. You couldn't do it in the moment. And so this notion about really building a solid foundation on which you operate, you need to do that ahead of time. It needs to be all of the work we do on trust and safety and content, moderation, security. That is the foundation on which you can build everything else. The Hengpuls and at one point said to me, you have to have the will and the means. And too often by the time you have the will, you no longer have the means. His comment was be decisive, act early, even in the absence of information. I think that's true in this whole notion of investing for long-term growth. Because if you're not actually assessing progress along the way, and you just assume, you know what, we can keep investing in everything. At some point down the road, you'll say, I wish I had made those tough calls to double down on the things that really mattered. What times are we in now? What's your read on the economy today? Especially with rising inflation? Well, look, I think back to March of 2020 and where we were. And I think of all of the intervention and steps that have been taken since then. And you've certainly seen the recovery coming out the back end. And it's been really gratifying from those painful days to see the breakthroughs that we've had not just on the medical front, but we've also seen the improvement across businesses. I think one of the biggest concerns, in particular, as you're seeing us, go through a digital transformation and the acceleration of it, is ensuring that everyone has the skills, the digital training and skills to thrive in this new economy. Google now reaches more than half the people on the planet. Why shouldn't we view Google as a monopoly? We often say that people come to Google not because they have to, but because they want to. It's really opening the world for so many people, so that's the intent. I want to talk a little bit about regulation. You were drawn to M&A in your early days at Morgan Stanley. Microsoft is making some big acquisitions, deals that some think Google maybe would have wanted to win in a former life, is antitrust scrutiny constraining any of your business plans? And your ability to compete? So the main thing that we've done throughout the life of Google is really invest in innovation, its organic growth, and we're continuing to do that at a really rapid clip. We have then layered onto it, tuck in acquisitions and larger acquisitions, and we're continuing to be active. More on the smaller ones and the add-ons to be fair. But we think there's a lot of opportunity still ahead of us. And so we're continuing to invest in partnerships, in some acquisitions, and do you think that there's still upside in a lot of different areas? So would you say this regulatory scrutiny isn't slowing you down? It's really important for those of us in certain leadership positions.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1715,2022-11-22 03:13:19
19102," think that there's still upside in a lot of different areas. So would you say this regulatory scrutiny isn't slowing you down? It's really important for those of us in certain leadership positions to be very focused on constructively engaging and working with regulators on what are the issues, what is it they're trying to solve and how can we constructively engage with them. At the same time, our engineers should focus on innovation and continuing to kind of up the bar on everything we're doing, address what is most helpful for our users. Google is facing more serious legal threats at this time in the United States than the other big tech companies. How are those conversations with regulators going? Are they frustrating at this point? Well, there's certain elements that are frustrating because I listen to the outline of some of the proposed legislation. And I think it's inconsistent with some of the priorities for public policy. So as an example, there's a lot of focus on what is called self-preferencing. Are you putting too many of your own products together? But during the pandemic, one in three small businesses said they would have failed without digital skills. Why? Because what they were able to do is connect with their users in different ways. So if you go search for a small business, you can then go to a map and you can get directed to the small business, that's a good thing. We have 6,000 small businesses who wrote in and said, you know what, we need these digital tools and skills. Same with a number of things on racial equity. Real surge in searches about where can I, where's a black owned business near me and the ability to direct people through search and maps. So I think that what's really important, and that's why I said it's about constructive engagement, let's make sure we understand what they're trying to solve and work with them on what is it that we're trying to address through products so that the products are helpful in the ways that they want. Facebook has taken a serious reputational hit. Has that had ripple effects or created collateral damage for Google? Well, I think that whenever there's a backdrop that's challenging, it has ripple effects. But what we're really underscoring is all of the steps and investments that we are making to really protect the ecosystem the way we, our commitment to our users. So we know how sacrosanct that trust is and it's all about privacy and what are the steps that we're taking to make. Privacy could protect it for our users. What is it that we're looking at to protect content and content moderations? Google now reaches more than half the people on the planet. Why shouldn't we view Google as a monopoly? So I go back to the earliest days when Google, I first learned about Google back in 1998. And in those earliest days, when I heard about this like eight search engine, the question is why do you actually need it? And back at Morgan Stanley, it's working with our research analyst Mary Meekers. She actually had her team put up white pages all around the conference room and was doing this comparison, well provided the most responsive results most rapidly. And all of a sudden you could see, well, when did this Google thing actually, maybe we do need something new. And that's been the ethos at Google since inception. It's just continued to innovate to make this eight never better experience for users. And so if we can, if we can deliver on that, which is what drives people here, it's really opening the world for so many people. So that's the intent. Facebook and Twitter are exploring digital currency. What is your thought on the crypto market? And is there a play for Google? So we look at it. There's nothing to comment on now. I think we're much more interested in blockchain and the underlying technology and the implications for the business and also for the way we can support our cloud customers. So certainly a lot of effort there. There's considerable chatter in the crypto universe that Web 3 and the blockchain could circumvent the power of Facebook and Google and more. What do you think about the next frontier of the internet? At this point, I think there are a lot of different things ahead of us that are actually studyingly exciting that enable us to actually continue to address different needs and requirements. Like I look at, for example, in something like health where I think blockchain will be very valuable when you think about health and health records. There are also a whole host of us.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1716,2022-11-22 03:17:22
19103," requirements like I look at for example in something like health where I think blockchain will be very valuable when you think about health and health records. There's also a whole host of other areas where the data analytics that we provide are absolutely critical. Should we make excuses to our employer? Should we tell our like if I have to head to a parent teacher conference or take a kid to the doctor, do I tell my boss that or do I tell him? You don't let your boss, you've got to get over the guilt. You survived breast cancer twice. What was your biggest fear at that time and how did you overcome it? The biggest fear was I wouldn't make it and I remember when someone at some interview while I was going through chemo said where do you want to be in five years and I froze because it was I want to be alive and I learned a couple of really important things. One given breakthroughs in medical technology, I learned to love the word manageable. This journey does become manageable, not for all cancers but for many more cancers and that gave me a lot of confidence talking with other survivors about it is manageable get the best care and just plow through it. I was just very grateful. I'm grateful for all of the investments people have made over the years but for anybody out there and I think everybody sadly will be touched by cancer either themselves or someone they know and love. Many of these cancers are manageable and just go at it with gusto so that's what I did. You're a mom of three sons and I find that especially remarkable because I also have three sons. How have you managed that over the course of this incredible career? How do you find that right mix of focus and free time to spend time with your family and doing the things that you love? So my kids give me energy they're remarkable and I think one of the important things for me is this notion that you do have to have a mix. It's not about trying to find balance the physics of which is really challenging. I think when people try it for balance they always feel they're failing on something because something's out of whack. So this metaphor that life is like a kaleidoscope and you need to have different shaped pieces of glass and different color and sometimes one is larger than the other and what's beautiful about life is when it's constantly moving around and so to me that metaphor has actually been sort of an anchoring principle. The other is you have to put the kids first so like they they know that I'm there you know when they need always and and I think that just making sure that you're setting the boundaries the way",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1717,2022-11-22 03:21:48
19104," I'm there when they need always. And I think that just making sure that you're setting the boundaries the way you need to, I would say it's much easier today than when I was growing up in banking. We had a cubicle, there was a computer room, you were anchored to the computer room. One of the many beautiful things about going through this evolution in work is understanding that hybrid works. So how do we get rid of mom guilt? Especially in this new work world. I want to shake my mom guilt. How do I do that? Okay so even when you feel it, just say you know what, it's an investment in my career because I can stay in this longer and be operating at a higher level if I'm really getting the stimulus from all parts of my life. So you've got to drop the mom guilt and when on the other side mom guilt with kids, I think they get it, I think they understand what we're doing and you know they'll never forget during the financial crisis at one point I was working on AIG. We went around the clock. I came home to shower that one like right as we were landing AIG and my three kids had each written me a yellow sticky note with a message on it and one of them was based, you know the essence of which was I get why you're doing this and they saw it as the right thing for the country. I don't need to over dramatize what it was but that's what it felt like at the time and that level of pride I still have those three stickies right by my bedside because I get it, I get the mom guilt, I wish there were certain elements I could have done differently but I also see the relationship we have and they understand what it means to actually be engaged in society and doing something you care about. No mom guilt. No mom guilt. Thank you. It's not allowed. Thank you. Should we tell her like if I have to head to a parent teacher conference or take a kid to the doctor, do I tell my boss that I'm going to be? You don't tell your boss. You don't tell your boss. Guys don't tell their boss. So what do we say? I don't think you say anything. I actually made this point at an event at Morgan Stanley. I'm like do not tell your boss. You've got to get over the guilt. The only way to move on from it is realize I'm a professional. I do things when I can and it makes sense and I get it all done. I just do it on my own timeline and I actually had a woman who emailed me afterwards and said I know you said I'm not supposed to tell my boss so I won't but I can't not tell somebody so I'm going to email you. And I'm like okay that's step one. I'm going to step one. Step attorney. Do not tell your boss. Tell your boss you know what I need to do certain things for myself and I'm getting I feel guilty doing it but I get everything done. There's no question you are so beyond having to check in with people. Well thank you. To not. We're in the middle of this so called great resignation and people are reflecting and changing and making big decisions. What's your advice to people in this big evolution? You know huge choices ahead. Well I think you framed it really well. I don't think it's the great resignation. I think it's the great reshuffle and people are reflecting on what do they want and how do they want to work and how do they want to live their lives. So I think for all of us thinking about what does that mean for our institutions it is about evolving the way we work, the way we interact, the expectations that we have to say but I grew up in a cubicle on the 26th floor of a skyrise. It doesn't work anymore. And so what should we do as leaders and I think that our this generation appropriately and it's very exciting expects more from all of us. And so it's not just in how we work but it is in what we do. And I think all elements of what's the mission are you delivering on the mission is really important. Okay so if you rapid fire questions someone you'd love to have dinner with. Oh well I'd love to say my parents because they passed away in over years ago. Favorite family ritual? We do this crazy thing that we've done for years which is everybody gets to pick where we travel. We come up with the five different locations and then we all vote and then we get the grid and that's where we go. What's your favorite getaway? Probably I would say maybe Iceland was the vast that's an amazing one. New York or California? Oh so unfair.

Well, sitting here outdoors right now and knowing I can do that for the rest of the years for you guys, for the energy from New York. So I'm not going to, it's like my, I don't pick amongst children. So, in closing, Google is a massive company, multiple divisions, many bets. Where are you spending most of your time now? I'm spending most of my time on your very morning question about capital allocation because if it really goes to this core point, you've got to invest for long term growth and making sure that you're investing with the right intensity. I often say I don't want to get to the two-yard line but not score. So you need to make sure you're investing with the right intensity to support long term growth. That's the most important area where I would say I spend the bulk of my time and then of course you have to prioritize in order to recycle to support those efforts. What kind of discussions are you having with Larry and Sergey now about this next phase of Google? So when they made the announcement about the role of change, they really, they were very serious about moving to this board role and they've been, they're amazing board members. Sundar of course relies on them for council wherever whenever but most of the interaction is really around what are we doing at the board level and send great. And you have your freedom to allocate capital as you like. I work closely with Sundar and Phillip and Thomas and yes we work as a great team. So what's the vision for Google then 10 years from now? You know it's fascinating to, was I think I had the same reaction you did when I heard Sundar say search is the biggest moonshot and I think that continuing to find ways to be helpful to users to solve what they need where so many people are coming online and it is video going to be the first, the way they understand it's going to be about, you know, search is going to be a different type of experience so much of it's going to be about voice first and language translation. So it's going to continue to evolve. And what about for you personally? Like, where will you, you know, it's been so amazing to hear about your journey and I'm just curious about your personal growth. Like what you feel you've accomplished in the last, you know, since you've been here and what you hope to accomplish. I find that the opportunity to try new things and to invest in new things and as we think about well what does that mean for each one of our areas there's, I think that intellectual curiosity keeps you young and I think that continuing to learn is like your brain is like silly putty getting pulled in a lot of directions. So to me it's continuous learning. I'm really grateful for that. Thank you so much for joining us. It's been wonderful to be here. Thank you. Thank you. Great to have you on campus. Thank you.

He and I literally were talking about it last night. He's like that. You're the one who made me give up on it. I'm like, no, I didn't.

From Google headquarters in Mountain View, California, this is Bloomberg Studio 1.0 with Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai. Gordon raised in India. Pichai had almost no access to a computer until college, but just years later found himself rising through the ranks of the world's largest search engine. In 2015, it was Pichai that Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin chose to run Google and later Alphabet. Now valued at more than $2 trillion. It's one of the most powerful companies on the planet. Sundar, it's great to be with you today. Thanks for doing this great to be here in person. Google just hit a $2 trillion market cap Alphabet, I should say. Where is the next trillion dollars going to come from? You know, I've always felt, you know, your market cap valuation is an effect of the value you provide and I feel fortunate. Our mission is timeless. You know, there is more need to organize information than ever before. I still feel searches are biggest moonshot as a company. You know, people will want radically more conversational experiences. They will want what we call multimodal experiences. They may speak to search. They may look at something and ask what what the information is. Being able to adapt to all that and evolve search will continue to be the biggest opportunity. We are so excited about the YouTube cloud or hardware products, Google Play. So we're building a diverse set of businesses, but an underlying all of it is the investments we are making in AI. We've invested $100 billion in R&D in the past five years. And so applying AI in a deep way is probably where we will create the biggest opportunity ahead. For softest making some big acquisitions, apples, anti-adtracking technology is shaking up the industry. What do you make of these competitive moves? Your competitors say they're on the right side of history. Are they? I look at the fact that there are three billion people who have access to knowledge of their fingertips. I look at the opportunity we provide. I look at the skills people are learning through YouTube. I feel that everywhere when I go talk to people and providing access to information and knowledge, I think will end up being on the right side of history as well. Your predecessor, Eric Schmidt, told me that he feels the latest Facebook revelations are disturbing. Google also has access to massive amounts of our data. Why should half the world's population more than half the world's population trust Google to do the right thing? We are trying to do more with less data. One of the biggest changes we made was making order delete the default setting for new users signing in. And now over two billion users have their data continuously being deleted. We rely on trust for people every day when people come to Google. They place their trust in us in vulnerable moments. Maybe a healthy shoe on which they are trying to understand. There is no more important responsibility we have than doing right by that trust. When we provide Gmail to journalists and realize that there accounts may be under attack by an authoritarian government. That's what motivates us to make sure be privacy, be security, be trust.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1720,2022-11-22 03:34:43
19107," may be under attack by an authoritarian government. I mean, that's what motivates us to make sure be privacy, be security, be trust. We are doing the right thing. Over time, regulation will have an important role to play here. I think privacy regulation is important in areas like AI regulation will be important. And so I think those will be part of the answers as well. The Facebook fallout. That Instagram can be toxic to teens, for example. Has this raised more or new concerns for you about the impact of technology, tech addiction, algorithms, YouTube even, on our children and their development and their mental health? I mean, you're a parent, and you also have a lot of power over how this plays out. You know, I mean, like you, bringing kids up in this modern digital world is something I think all parents are anxious about rightfully so. I think it's part of why a few years ago when in YouTube, we were exposed to a set of concerns. We invested. It became our number one priority to work harder. The reason YouTube invested so much in developing YouTube kids as a safe destination for young children, so on. The technology is going to play a big role in helping give children the next wave of opportunity as well. So the answer is to develop it responsibly. We have changed our balance in these areas and saying, we think about content responsibility first, and then the pace of development for new features in areas like YouTube. And so that's how we approach it for a while. Facebook and Microsoft are all in on the metaverse. What do you think about the metaverse? What's Google's metaverse strategy? It's always been obvious to me that computing over time will adapt to people and people adapting to computers. You know, you won't always interact with computing in a black rectangle in front of you. So just like you speak to people, you see and interact. Computers will become more immersive. They'll be there when you need it to be. So it's always been excited about the future of immersive computing, ambient computing, AR. And we are in. Is that count as the metaverse? Is that what that is? You know, metaverse is, I think it means different things to different people. The way I think about it is evolving computing in an immersive way with augmented reality. As part of that, there'll be many experiences, some of which will be immersive interactive virtual worlds, which is the metaverse concept. And you know, but I think this doesn't belong to any company, right? I mean, this is the evolution of internet and the web, the internet, all of it will continue to evolve. Google was famous for its campuses, where you could go and never leave. You had everything you ever wanted. Now you've said they can be flexible. They can work from home. They can work at the office. They can be hybrid. They can work remotely, permanently, perhaps. Are you committed to really letting them do this forever? And if so, how does that change the future of work and society? Look, we've really embraced the fact that the future is going to be flexible. At Google, we've always tried to give, you know, agency to our employees. But we do realize the importance of bringing people together, the creativity, community, and collaboration that comes with it. So the balance we are striking is this notion of 3.2. And what we're giving, the strength of our company is we have more locations than most of the companies. So we're giving people a choice to move anywhere in the world. Four weeks they can work from anywhere. We're going to accommodate 20% of our workforce to be remote over time. So we're going to embrace that flexibility. Forever. Forever, yeah. And we're committed to it. Through it all, it forces us to design better products. And since people use Google Workspace to run their companies, I think gives us a chance to innovate and bring all that out. I think there is so much value in giving people more flexibility between their personal and professional lives. And I think it will lead to people being happier. And I think companies can be successful in that model. And so we are trying to get the best of both worlds, but embrace the flexibility and see where we go. How confident are you that when you look back?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1721,2022-11-22 03:39:05
19108," of both worlds, but embrace the flexibility and see where we go. How confident are you that when you look back, you'll be able to say Google did enough to help save the world. We are putting so much energy and resource into it. You grew up in India, you lived through droughts, water was scarce. How has that experience shaped your feelings about the urgency of stopping climate change? I grew up in Chennai, India, and a big part of my childhood was a really pretty severe water scarcity. We would get water trucked in for the streets and stand in lines and carry a few buckets of water at home. There was no running water for many years. But fast forward a few years ago, Chennai had 100-year flood, which was an extremely, kind of, drove home. That combined with a few years ago, waking up to the orange skies here in the Bay Area, seeing the look of concern on my children's faces and having to explain it, all kind of drove home in a deeply personal way for me. I think it's the most defining issue we all face and definitely something very motivated on working towards. I remember waking up to those orange skies too and having to have that same conversation with my kids. Do you think the commitments at COP26 went far enough? We have to tip our hat to the people who are working super hard, the issues and the trade-offs are genuinely difficult. You have to keep the economies growing. It really matters. But at the same time, it's a pretty severe urgent issue. I'm encouraged by the progress. I think it builds on the Paris agreement. So I can see the forward progress. There is a deep anxiety that it all may not be enough. But, you know, we have to be optimistic and keep pushing. Google has set some aggressive targets to run entirely on clean energy to be the first tech giant to do so 24 hours a day. So, I'm confident are you that when you look back on this time, let's say a decade from now, you'll be able to say Google did enough to help save the world. We are putting so much energy and resources into it. It's always been kind of a founding value for us. We've been carbon neutral since 2007. We've been matching our energy consumption with renewable energy over the past few years. So, you know, we are now pushing. It's a moonshot to be 24-7 carbon free. That means every search you do, every email you send, that we can do it carbon free. We were at 61% in 2019.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1722,2022-11-22 03:43:46
19109," To be 24, 7 carbon free, that means every search you do, every email you send, that we can do it carbon free. We were at 61% in 2019, the number is now 67%. We have set our goals to be 100% by 2030. And to do it globally, that means we have to solve new things which we haven't done before. Wind and solar alone won't be enough. We just started geothermal in Nevada. We will be investing in newer technologies including carbon capture, etc. over time. So that's what excites me. We are a technology company at heart. So part of there are many answers to this problem. Some of it is that we are going to have to innovate our way out of it. And you know, we want to push as hard as possible in doing that. Our Bloomberg New Economy Forum is happening this year in Singapore. And the Asia Pacific region is one of the fastest growing internet economies on the planet. Where do you see the most room, the most opportunity for Google to grow there? You know, it's such a fitting timeframe. You know, glad you're focused on the region. It's the most vibrant region we see. It's our 20th year since we opened our office in Tokyo. It was the first office outside the Bay Area. You have two and a half billion people on the internet. There are many areas in which they are, they are leapfrogging trends which are here. And embracing the future digital payments is a great example. So many of our products originated from APAC, Google Maps, Google Pay. A lot of our journey to bring computing to more people is playing out in the Asia as well. I am excited about also the work we are doing through cloud. Because the companies there are rapidly transforming themselves digitally. So a chance to provide that is something very exciting for us. So super dynamic region that I feel like we are learning as Google being in the region. And so I think it will transform the first 10 years I would have said we took products here and brought it to APAC. For the past few years, we are beginning to build things there. And some of our future global products will be APAC first and rest of the world later. You can't talk about APAC without talking about China. You are facing stiff competition from Chinese tech giants there and beyond. What should US policymakers know about competing with China? There is a lot of conversations about US and China, the competition is fierce. Many look at areas like AI and quantum computing where we are investing a lot. You know, Chinese companies are neck to neck. What I think about, you know, I was encouraged by the news coming out of Glasgow, about the US-China agreement on climate. To me, while we talk about all the areas where we are competing, some of the biggest areas, which are common challenges for all of humanity. The pandemic was one. AI and AI safety over time will be a shared one. Obviously sustainability is another area like that. So I think these are all areas in which the countries can come together. And so I think that's a way by which we think about as, you know, when we compete on the internet and there may be different visions of how the internet plays out. So I see opportunities both sides. What are the chances that Google search will ever come back to China? Or that Google Cloud would ever come to China? You know, today we don't provide most of our signed-in services in China. And I don't see that changing. But you know, there are ways, as I said, in areas like AI or sustainability. I think there will be opportunities for us to work together. Through Cloud, we will support multinational companies, which have presents everywhere. And so maybe there are opportunities to work that way as well. AI is advancing at an astonishing rate. And it is hard to understand sometimes what this really means. In concrete terms, how will our lives look different? Let's say 10 years from now as a result of AI. You know, done correctly, you know, in many ways it's going to be helpful to you. You'll take it for granted. The same way today, for example, in India, over one-third of the queries on many phones come through voice. But it's something people take for granted. You can do it. So over time you'll expect to speak and be able to understand any language in the world. And you know, those are all ways it's going to be.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1723,2022-11-22 03:47:45
19110," be able to understand any language in the world and you know those are always it's going to make it better. You may go to a doctor's office and go through a scan and the system may be prioritizing for the radiologist so that they don't miss some important things, maybe giving them a second opinion. You know so these are all ways in which it will seamlessly start playing a role and I think we'll you know we'll see that it's a fact. You mentioned if done correctly and there are concerns there are fears that AI will replicate the worst of society even under Google's own roof from your own researchers. What scares you most about AI? What keeps you up at night? It's the most profound thing we are working on as humanity and and anytime we you're developing technology there is a dual sight to it. I think the journey of humanity is harnessing the benefits while minimizing the downsides. The good thing with AI is it's both going to take time. I think I've seen more focus on the downsides early on than most of the technology we've developed. So in some ways I'm encouraged by how much concern there is and you're right even within Google you know people think about it deeply we publish a lot of research there are I think it's more important that there are outside academic institution governments non-profits looking at this issue as well so I think it's it'll it'll be an issue which will have a lot of attention which gives me a lot of comfort as well. You said you'd pick up some new hobbies in the pandemic what did you start? The cooking pizza this learning cup which I was never good at. I'm caught on a little bit better. you have presided over Google through massive social movements that reverberated in and outside the company. What have you learned as CEO since the walkout? For me you know it was a moment I think it changed the company for the better you know we've always been committed. It gave us an insight on what more we could do we undertook deep commitments and the biggest you know overall and diversity and inclusion I think if you're committed and you actually put in the effort behind it you can make a difference. Now we have stated clear goals we are on track to meet those goals but it forced us to think about new answers so for example you know tech companies used to talk about the pipeline problem but we are now going to places where the talent is we're working much harder so going to Atlanta going to DC going to Chicago going to New York that's improving our diversity and representation at all levels. The war for talent is even more competitive now in this new world what",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1724,2022-11-22 03:52:14
19111," into Chicago, going to New York. That's improving our diversity and representation at all levels. The war for talent is even more competitive now in this new world. What are you offering? Elon Musk has said, big tech is a place where talent goes to die. How do you respond to that? OK. I look at the fact that we are looking to hire 30,000 people next year. I look at the impact we have on many people coming and working in the latest cutting-edge things. And many people come in. People leave Google. We are proud of people who have left Google. There are, I think, over 2,000 companies that have been started by whom we call as Zooklers. I'm equally proud of that. I think we are one part of a big system. And I think I'm proud of the role we play in bringing in people. And the impact they have over time in the outside world. All right. That's most of the heavy stuff out of the way. We're going to do some rapid fire just to get to know you a little bit better. You said you'd pick up some new hobbies in the pandemic. What did you start? Hi, pizza, cooking pizza. Just learning to cook, which I was never good at. I've gotten a little bit better. Cricket or soccer slash football? Wow, stuff. Both. Please don't make a quiz. OK. Squid game or Ted Lasso? I watched both. The Ted Lasso is much more calm. And so I'd rather take Ted Lasso over to Squid games any day. I know you're a voracious reader. So what's the last good book that you read? You know, I've been on a podcast bench. So a lot more podcasts than books nowadays. OK. Favorite videos you watch on YouTube with your kids? A lot of music videos. Music videos. This whole notion where creators are watching other things and commenting on it. It's a trend which my kids are really into. And I've kind of gotten used to it now. So watching other games, it's a phenomenon. Screen time policy that's worked for you as a parent. And what's not worked? You know, I've kind of given agency to my kids. The only thing I tell them is that I can look at their digital well-being once in a while with them. And so. How do you do that? I asked them to show it to me. And they show it on their phones. So that's pretty much the only thing. So beyond that, it's agency and talking to them about it. And making sure we are spending time doing other things. And making sure they develop good habits, basically. Metaverse or real world? Done correctly. You shouldn't feel the need to make a choice. You know, you always want to be present in the real world. And when you feel the need to do something, you want to do that. But I do think presence and the realness of the real world will end up mapping for humans for a long time. Do you own any crypto? I wish I did. I've dabbled in it, but you know, in and out. In and out. OK. Larry and Sergey, I'm not going to make you choose. How many times a week do you talk to them? I talk to them regularly. It kind of ebbs and flows. And so there are times we get excited about something. And we spend a lot of time talking it through. But it depends on what I need. A piece of advice you wish you had in your 20s. And a piece of advice you wish you had in your 40s. 20s would be, you know, being patient. You know, I think when you're young, you're very impatient, which is a great thing. But sometimes you do amazing things by slowing down and being really focused and doing it over a period of time. And so I would advise the younger version of me to be more patient. Maybe at 40, I would say, you know, when I look at climate, you know, I want all of us to be impatient. So, you know, I feel like when there's an urgency towards something, I think the world needs to be impatient. So that's that advice I would give to a older version of me. How much do you personally wrestle with the decisions that you have to make? And how much longer do you see yourself being the CEO of Alphabet, not just Alphabet, but also Google? Yeah. On the first one, there are moments we all have to make tough decisions. And you know, in some decisions way on me. And it's a privilege to do it. I have very good people helping me think things through. So I think the comments.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1725,2022-11-22 03:56:32
19112," You know, and some decisions weigh on me. And but I it's a privilege to do it. I have very good people helping me think things through. So I think the combination makes it all fine. On the second thing, I am lucky. I am so energized by the things we need to do. You know, I didn't have much access to computing growing up. It changed my life a lot. The one laptop or child goal really motivated me to come into technology and when I look at last week, us launching a affordable smartphone in India, the chance to bring the next billion users in Asia and in Africa online. That gives me a lot of energy. We'll be watching from afar. Sundar Pachai. Thank you so much for joining us. Thanks, Emily. Pleasure to be here. However you get your news.

19113," Espero! Jeff Bezos shocked the world when he stepped down a CEO of Amazon. Less shocking was his choice for successor. Annie Jassy was not only one of his longest-tenured lieutenants, but the architect of Amazon's multi-billion-dollar cloud business, Amazon Web Services, a moonshot that helped transform Amazon into not just e-commerce, but enterprise juggernaut. Jassy then needed to find his own successor, tapping a former colleague who helped grow AWS in its earliest days, but had since left to run Seattle software giant Tableau. His job to continue the reinvention of AWS and in turn, Amazon. Joining me on this edition of Bloomberg Studio 1.0, new AWS CEO, Adam Salipski. You worked for AWS for 11 years and then went on to become CEO of Tableau Software in 2016. Then you get a call from Amazon to come back and run AWS as CEO. Tell me about that call. Well, I was having a one-on-one at my prior company and my Apple news alerts went off like everybody else's did. It's at Jeff Bezos, who's taking on a new role and Andy Jassy's taking on the CEO role of Amazon. Of course, Andy and I worked shoulder-to-shoulder about 20 feet apart for 11 years. Of course, I reached out and congratulated him and we started talking. The conversation turned to some of the possibilities and next thing I know a little while later. Here I am back at Amazon, absolutely delighted and honored to be the CEO of AWS and helping to shepherd this amazing business for our customers. In that process, did you talk to Jeff as well? I had some communication, but it was principally with Andy, who of course was, you know, knew the AWS business best and of course was taking on the CEO role. But yeah, there was contact as you might expect with a small handful of other people. So what did Andy tell you he wanted in the next chapter for AWS? Andy reminded me, not that I needed reminding, but that it has really still day one for AWS and for our customers. It is still so early in this business. And we shouldn't think that just because the business has grown rapidly or just because we're currently the leader in the cloud, that it's anything close to mature. And so he really reminded me that we have to stay hungry and evade as quickly as we ever have done in the past. You're about half a year into the job. What changed while you were gone that surprised you? Well, I think that so many more customers have really adopted the cloud and really decided that they're going to be able to do it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1727,2022-11-22 04:05:26
19114," What changed while you were gone that surprised you? Well, I think that so many more customers have adopted the cloud and really decided that they're going all in. So, I mean, it was a pretty decent-sized business when I left, but it's really grown and the customer base is really expanded. And so, now we have very deep relationships at the CEO level, the CIO level, across every country, every industry, every use case, and we're regularly interacting with the most senior people at our client organizations. So, you were working at Real Networks in the early 2000s, and I understand you were offered a job at AWS without even really knowing what it was. I guess AWS was in stealth mode. Well, it was very secret. So, it was hard that the company didn't want to talk too much about it, but of course, we had to talk a certain amount about it. So, the call I got went something like, we have this initiative to turn the guts of Amazon inside out and expose it to other people. And it sounded intriguing, although I confess I didn't fully understand what that was all about. So, I came in and started talking to Andy and a few of the other senior leaders and eventually to Jeff. And I would have to say that even by the time I took the job, I thought I mostly understand what they're talking about. And it sounds like a good idea. And I'm in. But I also was like, well, we'll just have to see how it goes and Amazon's a big place. And so, I think we got a lot of intent to succeed here. And that's the thing that impressed me was Amazon really had the desire and the intent and the belief that this could be a really good business. AWS comes out of stealth mode and is the first to market with a cloud infrastructure service in 2006. How important was that first start? And do you think AWS still has an advantage today because of that? I think the time to market advantage that we had, which was probably honestly five to seven years, had started before other companies really started to take this seriously, was an enormous, frankly, it was just one of the biggest things that happened to us in the early years. Because at the beginning, a lot of people didn't get it. I would get asked a lot in 2006. So what does this have to do with selling books? And I even had a slide with kind of a pilot books on it and a question mark next to it. And the answer was it has nothing to do with selling books. But the technology which enables us to sell books, being global, being at a massive scale, being secure, being low cost, being a highly performant. All that technology has everything to do with offering these types of services externally. Now AWS isn't a scrappy startup anymore. And you do have big rivals, even though AWS is still the leader, Microsoft and Google are big rivals. How do you make sure that being big doesn't slow you down? It's a great question. We are currently the leader. And I mean, depending on which third party you look at, we're probably a little bit more than twice as big as number two. And it's really important to continue to act as if we're insurgents and to be insurgents. And not to start to act like incumbents. And I like to talk about actually managing the business. We want our senior leaders to be managing product and managing customers. And I think as you get bigger and you put more and more layers into your company, it's all too frequent that you start managing math. You start managing ratios and percentages and growth. And I think it's a real disease if you stray away from really focusing at a deep way on the product you're building and in a deep way on what your customers are telling you. And so we try and organize both with our org structure as well as just with our culture and what we choose to focus on, and really making sure that everybody is thinking about one or both of those two things, product and customers. And if you keep even the most senior leaders engaged at that level, then all of a sudden you maintain the urgency and you keep acting like an insurgent. We got to feel that urgency every day. So keep acting like an insurgent. That's the motto. And structure yourself and build a culture that allows you to. It's one thing to say it, but it's easy to say it. But it's much harder to put in place enabling mechanisms that enable you to do so. And we focus a lot of effort on those mechanisms. Now, do you think the cloud keeps getting bigger? And that AWS and Microsoft and Google just get bigger.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1728,2022-11-22 04:09:30
19115," and able to do so. And we focus a lot of effort on those mechanisms. Now, do you think the cloud keeps getting bigger? And that AWS and Microsoft and Google just get bigger pieces of an ever-expanding pie? Or at some point, doesn't become a zero-sum game. And that fight for market share becomes more brutal and more bloody. Well, I mean, this is a very large market segment. If you look at global IT spend, it's in the trillions of dollars. I've seen estimates like $3 trillion. It doesn't really matter how many trillions. It is. It's very, very large. And we've always believed that this was too good a market segment opportunity for the really to only be one winner. And sure enough, you've seen robust competition emerge. And we all compete vigorously. But it is. The segment is just growing so rapidly that I think, really, for us, we believe that the winning business strategy for a long time to come, and I would maintain forever, is to focus not on the competitors, but to focus maniacally on customers and wake up every day understanding exactly what it is that they need us to build next. And then work backwards from there, back internally, to how can we build those things. And if we do the best job at building the most quickly, the things that are most important for our customers, then I'm really not worried about what the competitors will do. You worked 10 feet away from Andy Jassy in the early days. Tell us something about the Amazon CEO that no one knows, but you. You're going to get me in trouble, aren't you? You in your car. I feel like I don't have pain in my chest, I grew up in Seattle and Andy coming from New York has this fascination I don't understand with New York sports teams. So I've had to endure that for a lot of years. New Yorkers, yeah. So what are you going to do? Although he's, I think, come to adopt some of the Seattle teams, particularly the New Hockey team, the Kraken here. As he should. As he should exactly. So how do you expect Andy will be different from Jeff? Or how has Andy already been different from Jeff? Well, I think we're all different as leaders. I think it's all important that we, it's important that we all bring our own stamp to it and operate within ourselves. I don't think I would be a very good Andy. I don't want to presume, but I would assume that Andy wouldn't be a great Jeff, because Jeff's Jeff, Andy's Andy, and I'm me. So I think that Andy was certainly bringing a great depth of experience from AWS, which is one important part of the business.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1729,2022-11-22 04:14:31
19116," And I'm me. So I think that Andy was certainly bringing a great depth of experience from AWS, which is one important part of the business and will having operated that business for so long. And I expect that it'll also give him an opportunity, although he was involved in other parts of Amazon certainly for a number of years. We'll be able to bring a fresh perspective to the whole company just as I hope to bring AWS and I think that fresh perspective is often helpful, I think, just the mere act of change is useful for the business, for customers, for employees and just to shake things up a little bit. So I think just a fresh perspective. How will you be different from Andy? Well, I think that the world around us is changing so much that we're going to have to be different. It doesn't matter what we did yesterday. And right after I joined, we actually added two new leadership principles, which is very exciting. One's around striving to be Earth's best employer and the second around focusing on the fact that success and scale bring broad responsibility. And those are things about which I personally am very passionate and so I really personally look forward to digging in and helping the company to figure out what are those things that we have to figure out. Where can we innovate to be Earth's best employer and then also to figure out externally what can we do to really be great citizens of our local communities, to be great citizens of our national communities and to be great citizens of the global community. And I care a lot about those things as a lot of other people do here, but I plan to put a good amount of energy and time and focus and hopefully help Amazon innovate in all of those areas. How closely do you work with Andy day to day? Is he regularly weigh in on AWS decisions or not? Well, he's got a pretty broad scope of things to worry about now, so he's got a pretty intense day job, I believe. So he's really focused across the company as you would expect him to be. But that being said, obviously, AWS remains an important part of Amazon and so we touch base regularly, be it in person or via email, just on the most important things going on in the business. Does Jeff ever weigh in on AWS decisions? Yes, I mean, really from the beginning, Jeff was involved at the very, very beginning at some of the most fundamental decisions. How do you price EC2? What do you name S3? What does the detail page look like? Obviously over time, we, the business grew, but this, Jeff was always available when we needed him and I certainly anticipate that'll be the same going forward. So is he still available now? And what do you understand that Jeff's priorities are? Sure. Well, let Jeff speak to his own priorities, but certainly Jeff has been available when, for example, we've been doing our annual planning cycle as many companies have and it's been great to have Jeff weigh in on really where we're heading for the next year and beyond and to just make sure it's easy to get focused on the details of the business and it's great to have multiple people who can help you pick your eyes up a little bit. Now, you joined AWS in the middle of a pandemic. We came back to AWS in the middle of a pandemic that's hopefully moving into the rear view mirror. Moderna is one of AWS's biggest customers. If it weren't for the cloud, if it weren't for AWS, would we have had a vaccine as quickly as we did? I've got to tell you, I'm Iuse, but it's been an absolute privilege for us to work with Moderna because what they're doing obviously is literally life-saving and they've been so innovative and so creative. So Moderna took a drug development process to get to the vaccine candidate. That process would typically have taken them 20 months and doing that on AWS in conjunction with all the innovation on their side reduced that 20 months to 42 days, 42 days to get the vaccine candidate, the MRNA vaccine candidate for COVID-19. And that was really running on running multiple parts of Moderna on AWS. So if you look at the drug design part, they had their drug design studio running on AWS all the way to manufacturing with the new digitized manufacturing that they call their digital manufacturing platform. So it's really end to end and the ability to use massive amounts of resources and to pick the exact type.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1730,2022-11-22 04:18:06
19117," their digital manufacturing platform. So it's really end to end and the ability to use massive amounts of resources and to pick the exact type of service and capability for each part of the job and to really bring the full set of resources to bear. In addition to not having to focus on the IT and the infrastructure and the technology, and rather letting Moderna focus on the all important job of drug discovery. So working in partnership, it was just magnificent to see what they accomplished. Since you joined AWS, a number of long-time AWS leaders have moved on to Microsoft, to Stripe, to Tableau, does that concern you? Well, actually retention has been very good. If you mentioned the senior leaders, if you look at the VP plus ranks, the VP and above ranks at Amazon, the average tenure is over a decade, over 10 years. So that's actually very, very strong retention. So of course, you're always going to have some level of people coming and people going. And at the end of the day, that's actually healthy for the business. You want new perspectives to come in. Of course, in the right proportion. Amazon has opened an investigation after 550 employees supported a petition, claiming a culture of discrimination, harassment, bullying, and bias. What's the status of this? Well, we are incredibly focused. And I personally believe it's incredibly important to really have a very diverse, inclusive and equitable environment. And we're going to make sure that whatever it takes, that we've got that. So we believe that we're really doing a lot of things to deliver on that. And we've got a lot of innovative efforts around bringing in a diverse workforce, which we have to have both because we're going to serve our customers best, their diverse, who we have to match that diversity. And also, I just believe it's our responsibility. And it's the right thing to do. Any time there is any possibility that things are not, something is not gone the way we wanted to. We're going to investigate it thoroughly. That's what we're doing in the middle of doing in this case. And we'll make sure that we're operating in a way that's consistent with our values. And that's always the only goal. If you could rewind to the early 2000s, the earliest days of AWS, is there anything you would have done differently to build an inclusive culture, to start with a more inclusive culture, to make sure that it didn't become a boys club? Well, I don't think that's what we have. I think that we do have a really fun, exciting innovation led, an inclusive culture. And that being said, these are hard problems. I think we've done a lot, but we are no or close to where we need to be. We're going to be restless and dissatisfied with our progress on DE and I, just as we are with every other part of our business. Mark Zuckerberg is making a big bet on the metaverse. How big do you think it's going to be? It's such an interesting sense. The metaverse is real. Walt Disney queen on you really could get a statues book.

19118," MELON KALKING as the biggest trove of sensitive corporate data in the world. I'm curious how you think about the balance between data and privacy and freedom and civil liberties in the modern era. I mean, there are governments. There are nation states around the world that want that information. Hackers and criminals want that information. Well, we are very clear to start with that our first job is security. We often say security is job zero. It was on the first page of our operating plan pretty much every year that I can remember. But what about when governments request that information? So, subpoena that information. Sure. Well, we are very clear that our customers data is their data. So the data belongs to our customers. And not everybody operates that way. We are not going to look at customers data. We are not going to compete against our customers using their data. Their data is their data. And furthermore, we have all sorts of architectural best practices that our customers should be and are using for any sensitive data. And so a lot of that really relies around encryption. And so we build a lot of different encryption capabilities so that any sensitive data, which could leak for any reason, be it to a government, be it to a hacker, be it to anyone else, any form of security breach, that it's encrypted and useless to anybody else. Given the broad array of encryption solutions that we provide, it's actually very doable and powerful for our customers to safeguard their data that way. Mark Zuckerberg is making a big bet on the metaverse. Is AWS going to have a role in the metaverse? I think AWS already has a big role in the metaverse. So I think the cloud enables the metaverse. So if you think about all of the compute capacity, all of the storage, all of the machine learning, which is required to create, compelling a delightful end user experiences in the metaverse, a lot of that is already today running on AWS. So if you take Epic Games, for example, so Epic Runs Fortnite, massively popular game, 350 million users worldwide. And Epic Runs, almost everything on AWS from the backend, servers to the analytics and everything in between. So I think that's a great example of the metaverse at work and all that's happening today on AWS. And we anticipate that's only going to grow really rapidly in the future. How big do you think it's going to be? Such an interesting sentence. The metaverse is real. And yet it's virtual at the same time. I think that if we continue to do what we've always done, which is to provide a technology platform that allows organizations to transform then these gaming and entertainment and social media and other companies will be able to do what they do best, which is to focus on innovating on behalf of their end users. And I think that the metaverse in many other areas will be rich with invention. So this next conversation will happen in the spheres, in the metaverse. That's where we'll next meet. That could be, I'll meet you in the metaverse. All right, see you there. Now, I know that climate change and stopping climate change and your data center footprint is a big passion of yours. How fast will Amazon's data centers get to carbon neutral? Amazon is already the largest purchaser of renewable energy in the world. And we intend to be 100% renewable energy by the year 2025. We originally said 2030. We actually accelerated that by five years to 2025. And that's part of our broad or climate pledge that Amazon created, and to which we've now gotten 200 other organizations to sign on to. And the climate pledge is to be a net that's a carbon by 2040, 10 years ahead of the Paris Accord target. So we know how to do some of that. And other part are going to require invention.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1732,2022-11-22 04:26:57
19119," The pledge is to be a net zero carbon by 2040, 10 years ahead of the Paris Accord target. So we know how to do some of that. Other part are going to require invention, but we really look forward to it. And I think it's one of the most important things we can do for our generation. Amazon counts some of the biggest oil and gas producers as its customers. Isn't that a contradiction? Should you be kicking them off your platforms? Those customers are trying to get to sustainable business models which rely on new energy sources. And so many of those customers are figuring out how do they get to wind, how do they get to solar, how do they get into batteries, all new business models relying on renewable energy. And I think rather than abandoning them and having them maybe dig in more on fossil fuels, if we can enable them to move faster, to be more innovative, and to be more agile in figuring out new business models, new technical solutions, experimenting, failing fast, and moving on to the next idea, then the whole world will get to the renewable energy solutions that we need. At this year's re-invent conference, it'll be the first time that Andy Chassi is not giving the keynote. You will be, give us a preview. What can we expect to hear? We're going to have a lot of really exciting announcements. So I think across our service portfolio, you'll see that. We have a lot of exciting partner announcements. The partner ecosystem still remains to this day so important to what AWS is doing. And we have some great announcements lined up for that. And then I think people are going to want to see that we're making it easier and easier for them to consume the cloud and to work with AWS. And so we're going to continue to, in addition to building more powerful basic capabilities, we're going to continue to make it easier and easier in a variety of ways to interact with AWS.

Since this, very first YouTube video was uploaded 16 years ago, the world's most popular video network has exploded to more than 2 billion users in the farthest corners of the planet.

19120," Uploaded 16 years ago, the world's most popular video network has exploded to more than 2 billion users in the farthest corners of the planet, now raking in billions of dollars every year. It's evolved a long way from cat videos to become a one-click journey to the center of the zeitgeist, pop culture, and kid culture. Amplifying some of the brightest and sometimes darkest traits in all of us. While YouTube has elevated a generation of creators, and educated and entertained generations of viewers, it's fought misinformation, terrorism, racism, and violence many clicks along the way. Lately, YouTube's biggest battles are focused on eliminating COVID and vaccine misinformation and keeping the platform safe for kids and teens. On this edition of Bloomberg Studio 1.0, we rewind to talk about where YouTube has been, and fast forward to where it's going next, with one of the longest tenured employees and women at Google, the CEO of YouTube, Susan Wajitski. It's been five years since we last talked on camera, and we have a new president. We are weathering a pandemic. The most watched video on YouTube is... Baby Shark? Baby Shark. So a lot's changed since 2016. How do you feel about YouTube 2021 versus 2016? I feel good about it. It's definitely been a while, and in technology things moved so quickly, so a lot of things have changed since 2016. And overall, I've been really pleased that we've continued to grow and grow our ecosystem of creators, with invested a lot in responsibility. And that's been a really big focus for us, and with weather through a pandemic and a lot of hard challenges, but overall, I'm feeling really good. You've been at Google for 20 plus years, going all the way back to Larry and Sergey in the garage. You've been the CEO of YouTube for seven plus years. How has your job changed in that time? Since I joined being the CEO of YouTube, I would say one of the biggest things that has changed, certainly, has just been maybe the recognition of the importance of digital video. So when I first joined, actually a lot of people would say, oh, like, why did you join? I was running ads beforehand, and that's been the main way Google generates revenue. And so a lot of people said, like, why did you leave that and go to YouTube? But I always believed in digital video, and I believe that now we see that the world also believes we've seen a lot of adoption of digital video and the benefits that that can have. You've championed this diversification strategy at YouTube since you started. What's working and what's not working? Well, our main way of generating revenue is from advertising. But we also have really grown our subscription revenue, and that has been really, really important from many different reasons. So that has enabled our users to have an experience where they can have music, YouTube music and premium. We just announced the 50 million subscribers that we were really excited about. But we also see other ways that our creators generate revenue. So our creators, for example, generate revenue with channel subscriptions. They may sell merchandise. We also have things like digital goods, so like super chat, super thanks. And so we've basically diversified the number of ways that our ecosystem is generating revenue. The original tagline for YouTube was broadcast yourself, and that concept has exploded. You have ordinary people in the spotlight. When they grow up, they want to be an influencer. They want to be a YouTube star or a YouTube creator. What do you see as the future of the creator economy? I see a lot of possibility with the creator economy. And because I see that many people have a lot of interest, and they have a lot to offer. And beforehand, they went up and able to have shared that with the world. And so there are so many people depending upon what their talent or their interest is, whether it's a sport or cooking or gaming. Or hairstyles that people have come out and really been able to share that and create a lot of jobs. So we actually see, like our, we actually saw a 35% increase in the number of creators that are generating.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1734,2022-11-22 04:35:27
19121," a lot of jobs. So we actually see like our, we actually saw a 35% increase in the number of creators that are generating six figure income out of YouTube. And in the last year. And so that's just an example of like how the creator economy is continuing to grow. Well, and for years, YouTube was the only company that actually paid creators, but now a lot of companies are paying creators. Facebook and Instagram, Snap, TikTok. How do you see that competition playing out? Who wins? Well, it is a competitive landscape. And in general, I mean, competition's good. It makes everyone work harder and that's good. I mean, we look at creators and we say, they're going to come to us if we do the best job. And creators come to us looking basically for fame and fortune. Like, how can I, I have a skill or I have a talent, something I want to share with the world like, and YouTube can help that be known, can help them provide that fame, but also we can generate revenue for them. And so as long as we're doing a good job of that, creators are going to come to us. If we start to fail, then they're going to leave us and they're going to go to another platform. And so we just need to work really hard to make sure that we deliver that for our creators. A year ago, during the Black Lives Matter protest, YouTube made big commitments to Black creators in particular. What's been the progress there? And how do you see YouTube, the potential for YouTube to be used as a tool for social justice? Well, so we've made an announcement that we were going to do a $100 million Black Voices Fund. And so we're continuing to develop content there. But one of the other thing, and I think there'll be, there's been a lot of great content that's come out and we'll certainly see more. But, you know, because YouTube doesn't have any gatekeepers, like you can just post and become a creator, you know, we've, we have seen a lot of people of different backgrounds and underrepresented backgrounds become creators and have audiences. We never really measured it beforehand, because we didn't have a way. And so one of the things that we've done is within, with enabled creators to now tell us what backgrounds they affiliate with so we can have a better understanding of how they're doing on our platform. Let's talk about YouTube shorts. It seems to be a top priority. Yeah. We all know that TikTok is on the rise. How important are YouTube shorts to the platform, to the company? So YouTube first, it's very important. We see that creators and users want to watch all types of content, long form, short form. It turns out that the first video that was actually ever uploaded to YouTube, me at the zoo, was an 18 second video. So it was a short form video. And we have lots of short form videos. And we've had it way before TikTok did. But what we have really been leaning into more is just enabling those to be found. And then a lot of the creation tools. And so bringing a lot more mobile creation is really important for us going forward. Did you notice that viewing time was being lost to TikTok? Did you see that trend? And do you see TikTok as a sort of existential threat? I mean, we definitely see many competitors in this space. What we're just focused on are like our own metrics like do we see our users engaging? Where's our opportunity? We're always looking around and seeing what our competitors are doing. And if they're doing something that we think would be good for our users and our creators, we're also going to look at how we can improve our own economy, creator economy, and what's good for our users. I think a lot of people, you know, we talk about vaccine hesitancy and they blame social media. They say YouTube's not doing enough. One of the big things for us is to continue to work with public health experts to get their messages across.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1735,2022-11-22 04:39:53
19122," Well tonight I have all sorts of songs. Boys and girls! Today's your big day, are you excited? Mama is tired. You have to feed your creativity. So this tree house, you guys ready for the movie? See what we can do. At this point, you two have become a hub for discovery, for information, for, you know, it satisfies our curiosities, right? That comes with a lot of inspiration, but also with misinformation. When it comes to vaccines, vaccine hesitancy, videos that cause a public health risk, where do you want to see YouTube do better? We've taken responsibility very seriously. It's been one of my top priorities. So first of all, we want to make sure that if there's information that violates our policies, we came up with 10 different policies around COVID. Then if that's a violation of policies, then that's something that will remove. We removed over a million videos associated with COVID, but we also want to make sure that we're raising up information that we think would be that come from trusted and authoritative sources. And we've really been able to do that. I think a lot of people, you know, we talk about vaccine hesitancy and they blame social media. They say YouTube's not doing enough, you know, how do you respond to that? Yeah, I mean, I think, first of all, we're always learning. I just, just to be fair, like, we're always thinking about how can we do better? We're looking at the feedback and working with public health experts across the board. And, you know, I think one of the big things for us is to continue to work with public health experts to understand, you know, what are the ways that we can partner with them to get their messages across. And I really believe that that is something that's really changed is the evolution of bringing creators, musicians, experts talking about public health. We never would have seen that before the pandemic. How much do you internalize the criticism of YouTube's content? Do you take it personally? And how does that influence the decisions that you make as CEO? I want to be doing the right thing. And I care about that. I care about the legacy that we leave. I care about the world that we leave to our children. I care about how media is consumed by the next generation and by everyone today. And so I really have put a lot of time and effort to make sure that we are acting responsibly. And there's always a balance between the free speech and the right, but being responsible and taking down content that we think could lead to some kind of real-world harm. And so, I mean, sure, I think whenever you're in a position like that, there's going to be a lot of criticism. But our goal is just to continue to talk to experts and evolve. And how do you make decisions in those tough moments where it's a tough call? Like, how much of it is making a decision or leading by consensus and how much does it come down to you? The goal is that when we have tough decisions, they're not, we're not, they are like improvising in some way. Like, we've made a concrete set of decisions beforehand and then we're looking and saying, is this something that meets our standards? Is it a violation or not a violation? And if it seems like there's some set of issues with the content that we have on the platform, we're going to go back to experts and then reevaluate. Should we be making changes to our policies? YouTube helped keep a generation of children connected, educated, entertained, distracted through the pandemic. What have you learned from that experience and what do you see as the potential future of YouTube as a tool for learning, as a tool in schools? What I mean is, I think, the opportunity experience plays an important role in trying many strengths.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1736,2022-11-22 04:44:23
19123," What have you learned from that experience and what do you see as the potential future of YouTube as a tool for learning as a tool in schools? When I meet people and they find out I'm the CEO of YouTube almost always they tell me about something they learned on YouTube or someone that they're something their family member learn. So I see that as being a very significant part of YouTube and during the pandemic we certainly saw that a lot more education went online and we had all the home schooling. We had people who had to also just learn a lot of skills that they hadn't learned beforehand. But probably the biggest thing that we also learned was just and that I really saw was the need for us to continue to work with educational institutions and the need for us to be able to integrate with some of the learning tools that the kids are all using because they are using YouTube. And there's a lot more that we can do to really help educators have YouTube be a key part of the curriculum. My kids are on YouTube a lot and sometimes more than I want them to be and sometimes it's super productive and they're learning something cool and sometimes it's not productive at all. How are you innovating to make the time that kids spend on YouTube more valuable and of course safe? It's very important to me as a parent to make sure that we're giving parents options about how what they want their kids to see. And that's one of the reasons that pretty much as soon as I got to YouTube we started working on YouTube kids, which is a separate app, which is important for kids in terms of how we can control the quality and we can give parents a lot more control about what kind of content is appropriate for them and their family. And you know there are many other things like we actually just came out with a supervised experience for tweens because tweens was one of the age groups that was actually hardest they usually don't want to be on the kids app, but they're not 13 to be on the on the kids. So it's really important to be on the on the main app and so the supervised experience is something that we recently came out with. The Wall Street Journal has been doing some in-depth reporting on Facebook. The report is that Facebook knew that Instagram was toxic for teen girls and didn't do anything about it. Does YouTube look at the impact it has on teen users? The influence it might have on someone's body image or self-esteem? It's a very important topic and we do have a panel of experts that we work with to be able to help us understand what are the different ways that our product could be used or what are how do we face some of these challenging issues to make sure that we're getting the best advice. And we certainly do see for a lot of really tough issues that YouTube can be a really valuable resource. So body positivity, mental health, we see a lot of creators actually talk about mental health. And that for a lot of kids it's really like destigmatizes and enables people to talk about what's happening and what's going on with them. The potential long-term impacts of YouTube on teens and on children, whether it is toxic or whether it's addictive. Is that something that you wonder about? Is that something that you struggle with not just as a CEO but as a mom? We certainly want to make sure that we are doing what we can to be responsible with kids and in every way possible. And that's one of the reasons that we actually have worked hard to give parents as many options as possible for them to decide what is important for them and their family, whether that's like limiting screen time, like limiting what is the content they actually have access to. Even letting parents just say, these are like the 10 videos, my kid can only see these 10 videos. And so that is really important for us to give the tools back to parents for them to decide what is best for them and their family. Are you concerned about looming regulation? There may be regulation that is well-intended but actually then has a really negative impact. Thank you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1737,2022-11-22 04:48:35
19124," Delicious Quare ruining the host's Amazon No lies Ha ha, I would like to begin by addressing the heinous attack on the United States Capitol. Like all Americans, I am outraged by the violence, lawlessness, and mayhem. How much did President Trump test YouTube and how much did it test you as a leader? The election integrity is something that we see incredibly, it's incredibly important. And we've leaned into in every way we possibly can. We treat all public figures and all public leaders the same as we treat any individual. And so, meaning that everybody is held to the same standards. And so we definitely held President Trump as we would hold all other presidents and all other elected officials to the same standards that we hold our creators and anyone else on YouTube. What was that difficult for you as the CEO of the company? I mean, that's kind of, that's like a big responsibility. I mean, yeah, it is difficult, but it is very important and we also are global. So we're dealing with leaders from all over the world. And there were a number of leaders that, and there continue to be a number of leaders, that poster that there's content that may be a violation of our policies. But we do hold a consistent standard across everything that we do. YouTube was the last platform to ban Trump. And you have said his channel will be reinstated when an elevated risk of violence has subsided. How and when specifically will you make that decision? Well, we'll make that decision based on a number of different factors, whether that is like events in the news, signals we're seeing from the government. And we'll certainly continue to evaluate that based on a large number of signals that we see. And will he ultimately be reinstated? I mean, we've stated that we will reinstate him when we believe that there is no risk to public safety or no public danger. Google just removed a voting app for the Russian opposition leader, Alexi Navalny. The Russian government seems to be stepping up requests to take down content. You've talked in the past about your family history, your grandparents living behind your right hand being concerned about censorship back then. And Russia is a huge YouTube audience. Yeah. How concerned are you about Russian government overreach? One of the things that we're is important to us at YouTube is the fact that we do enable so many voices and that we do enable people to express themselves and really celebrate the freedom of speech. And we certainly, yeah, that's a core value of ours. But when we work with governments, there are many things that we have to take in consideration, like whether it's local laws or what's happening on the ground. And so there's always going to be multiple considerations that we're going to have to take into consideration. Navalny said that YouTube deleted a video, one of his videos. Was that at the request of the Russian government? We certainly get requests from governments and we look and consider why are we getting the request, what's actually happening on the ground. And based on a whole bunch of different factors, we make a decision. So we don't always, those are not always requests that make sense for us to honor, but in certain cases, we will...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1738,2022-11-22 04:53:00

We've seen Mark Zuckerberg. We've seen Jack Dorsey now testify before Congress multiple times. And I've heard it said that YouTube is getting a pass. Do you think you should be up there testifying? Well, I think we do get a lot of scrutiny. I feel like there's a lot of scrutiny. And because YouTube is part of Google, Sundar has testified a number of different times and answered many different questions on YouTube. So I do believe there's a certain amount of scrutiny. And you know, if I were ever asked to testify, it certainly would go and testify as well. You're one of the most senior women at Google. If not the most senior woman at Google, Google has faced a lot of scrutiny for how it treats women in recent years. How much progress do you think Google has made in hiring and promoting women across the company? And how much progress do you think still needs to be made? I see a really big effort across technology as a whole to be able to be more inclusive. And I think that is really positive. I've been a big supporter of it. It's the very beginning. And I mean, I think at Google, there are many efforts and there's a lot of a lot of work that has been done. And I'm sure there's a lot more for us to continue to do. And if you just look at the stats, you can see they're not enough women. We need more women in technology. And I think we have made a lot of progress, but it's still hard. It's harder to be a woman in technology. It's harder to be a minority of any kind. And so I think there's still a lot of work for us to do. When we last spoke five years ago, you know, I asked you about being a mom. You have five kids and you said something that really stuck with me. You said being a mom makes me a better leader. I prioritize better. I see something growing fast. And I run towards that. If something's growing closely, I'm like, I don't have time for that. How has that management strategy played out for you? I think it's played out really well. Thank you, Sven. I mean, rare sensation is everything when you look at it. Because we have a lot of opportunity. There's a lot of moving pieces, very dynamic environments. So if you can prioritize and say, these are like the most important things to do, then you're going to get there faster. Larian Sarge, have no left. How long do you plan to keep running YouTube? How long do you plan to stay at Google? As long as I have a mission that I believe in and that I, and things that I'm excited about getting done. So I have a lot of ways that I see that YouTube can continue to grow. I have a lot of products and ideas and things that aren't yet released and things that we don't aren't yet doing. And I'm excited about getting those done. So I think if there comes a time where I no longer have a list of projects, or I feel like I don't have that much more to add, then it'll be probably time to do something else. Would you throw your hat into the ring to be Alphabet's next CEO, or if the board asked you, would you step up and do that? Well, I think Sender's doing a great job. I'm very, very pleased. I think he's doing, I mean, it's a very challenging job. There's a lot of different constituents and a lot of product, a lot of different issues. And I mean, I'll just say I'll always do whatever would be, wherever I could be most helpful to the company. Do you still talk much to Larry and Sergey? I do still see them socially, though, not workwise. Do you ever talk about work? I mean, sometimes we'd be casually, but our business is very complex right now. And there's a lot of things that are happening. And so it's hard for, I mean, people may have different opinions, but to really engage it's a long conversation. What do you want your legacy to be? I am proud of the way that we've been able to enable people to have a channel, to have an audience. Like, I just met with a number of three creators. And like, YouTube really was able to let them shine and create audiences in a business and employ people that otherwise never would have happened. And so that's certainly one, continuing to grow that. I'd say second, it's been really important to me to see a lot more women in technology.

And this is now about Genesis. Bloomberg understands that bankruptcy is an option if they fail to raise capital, which they've been trying to do after the collapse of FDX, cause a lot of the counterparties to run for other options. Currently, a little bit of stabilization in Bitcoin at $15,800, the futures for Bitcoin don't do any favors for the outlook. It's unmistakably bearish according to the market's life team. Let's check in on how the markets elsewhere are faring in specifically Asia and about rulers in Hong Kong. Join us now. Thanks, you, Seth. You have just taking a look at JD.com as we come out of the lunch break for mainland China and Hong Kong because we did have that breaking headline just crossing the last 10 minutes or so. Essentially, we hear that JD.com could be planning to cut management salaries by as much as 10 to 20%. Now, if that goes ahead, it'll be interesting to see how traders do interpret that. Again, we did just have those third quarter earnings, strong earnings upside coming through with those with a lot of analysts really liking the cost cutting measures that are coming through at the company where they say we're already starting to see that impact the bottom line. And actually some of these Chinese tech giants are well ahead of their US peers in this space. Otherwise, we are seeing tech just selling down generally. That is, of course, given we are seeing COVID cases, as Manus was just saying, really expanding in China today, reporting more than 27,000 new infections. So we are back to levels so we haven't really seen this since the start of the pandemic. In terms of the broader picture today, we are still seeing the CSI 300 clinging on to gains as we are for the likes of Japan as well, India just online in the last hour or so. Manus, this is really being led by what's happening in the energy sector. Absolutely, and it's a heck of a wild ride there, isn't it? Thank you very much, Annabelle Trudeau is in Hong Kong. Speaking of the oil market, I mean, we've said it a little bit. It was a wild ride. We got these conflicting reports. It's possible. I put increase. That's what the traders digested first of all, and the demand picture on China, putting it together as a reporter, Stephen Stachinski. Stephen, I'm quite surprised that his Royal Highness came straight out with such a firm denial of the journal report. It just shows you that they want to retain complete control of the narrative until we all meet in Vienna in 10 days time. Yeah, I mean, that report when it was coming out, traders and folks in the market were saying, well, maybe this is a coordinated leak by Saudi to sort of test the market prices fell. But it was a bit of surprise. You don't usually see them come out so strongly against the report, and that's likely why prices recovered. So sharply, they ended the session yesterday, a little changed. OPEC seems to be keeping a tight control on the tap. It doesn't look like they're going to be adding supply quite yet. There is some time before they make an official decision, and it could turn out where they do do that. But the fact of the matter is, demand in China does remain weak because the country continues with this COVID-19 policy. For much of the year, the discussions on when Chinese demand will pick up has been in the forefront of all the sources and traders we talked to, and we were expecting a demand pick up by the end of the year, and that does not look like it's going to be in the cards as they continue this harsh policy. Steve, let's flesh that out a bit in terms of the key data that is going to drive the OPEC plus decision-making come December, what do investors need to look out for and how could it make a meaningful shift? When you're looking at China, you look at imports and run rates at the refineries. You have to look at what the traffic data is, you have to look at which regions are actually under lockdown, what the COVID cases are. That's the China picture. The other picture is also Russia. The EU is coming out with this price cap. They're going to launch it some of it as early as December, going to full force in February with all oil products. And the reaction from Novak, how Russia reacts, if they can't find other markets, they had signal that they would reduce output. So if they're reducing output and the market is tighter because of that, that's another thing that OPEC plus will have to digest, whether they say a cup.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1741,2022-11-22 05:09:49
19128," do's output. So if the reducing output in the market is tighter because of that, that's another thing that OPEC Plus will have to digest, whether they say it publicly because Russia is part of OPEC Plus is another question, but it is one piece of this larger element. And lastly, where are we in terms of the global economy, recession, recession, recession is something that the traders have been really banging the drum on. Are we closer to recession? Is there going to be a slight recession? That's something to also keep look at. Stephen, thanks for that. That's Bloomberg's energy reporter, Steven Stepchenski. Now, Bloomberg has learned that digital asset brokerage Genesis is struggling to raise fresh cash for its lending unit and is warning potential investors that may need to file for bankruptcy. Bloomberg News Crypto Market reporter, Siddharz Ashokla joins us now from Mumbai. I said, I mean, what's the latest update then on FTX? Given all of its different entities around the world, and what can we expect next in terms of litigation? So in the ongoing FTX, yes, so Bloomberg has learned that crypto investment firm, Genesis is struggling to raise funds for its lending arm. And if it's unsuccessful, then it might have to file for bankruptcy as well. This comes after we learned last week that BlockFi, a crypto lending firm as well, which was earlier bailed out by FTX may again be in the process of filing a bankruptcy as well. So that uncertainty reigns supreme in the market at the moment. And the contagion due to the collapse of FTX continues to spread. Yes, and that contagion, you know, funds are trapped inside FTX. There's an exodus from other platforms. Now, look, after declaring bankruptcy in terms of the amount of funds that were stolen from FTX as well, do we have an update on that? Because yesterday we heard the liquid editor, they'd find some balance sheets that were positive and find some cash. So what do we know? So regarding the theft that occurred at FTX after it had declared bankruptcy, we had learned that approximately more than $400 million worth of assets were stolen. At the moment, it seems like the hacker or whoever is behind this theft is swapping the assets for Ethereum and Bitcoin. So likely at the moment, cashing out of those assets seems to be a major challenge for the culprit. But it continues to be a major overhang on the market because the individual behind the theft became one of the largest holders of the Ethereum token. And people are concerned that if the entirety of the tokens are dumped into the market, that could further add to the existing setting. It sure has reverberations. We saw that last week, of course, when we understand that finance sold some of the tokens related to FTX and that that impart added fuel to the far. Thank you very much, Sid, for being with us. Siddhartha Shukla, the very latest on the FTX story. Some other big tech stories that are worth reflecting on, you know, if you look at Tesla, the time is 6% yesterday at one juncture. You've got the closed times in China, but you've also got this discount, this Elon discount, it's just spending far too much time on Twitter, but they've also got a recall of 300,000 cars. Yes, so now we're at the lowest level since 1 November of 2020. And I can't imagine anybody being surprised by this because if you look at his tweets and if you were to divide it up in ratios, before most of it will be dedicated around SpaceX and Tesla, now you add Twitter into the mix and his concentration is focused as a time is arguably not as readily available as it was before. And that is something together with the supply chain issues that you just mentioned that are weighing on investor confidence. This used to be a surefire by, wasn't it? Yeah, well, I mean, you got to believe in the future of the of the battery technology. There is a line of disclosure in all of the reports that Tesla put out there, which is the dependence on Mr. Musk is listed as a factor in the security finance. We're showing the imagery of Twitter. And of course, he is knee deep in the revolution of what Twitter is going forward. Twitter has lost almost 5,000 employees since Elon took over and he plans to fire more sales staff and it's our title on Austria is a hard core part. And this is",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1742,2022-11-22 05:13:57
19129," For instance, Elon took over and he plans to fire more sales staff and it's our title on Austria is a hard core part. And this is in part the risk. This is the Elon discount in Tesla as a result of taking over a major organization which you need to redesign in his view. So hard core version revamp at Tesla is on the way. I mean, the issue for me here is really around whether or not Twitter can remain credible and influential at a time when he's cutting left and right sales and beyond. And this is something where the sponsors and the partners of Twitter and that's something that's been flagged before have issued with. How deep do you cut before you start affecting what this platform is truly about? Look, I'm just going to tell the truth. I'm just waiting for Donald Trump's first tweet. Everything else is moderately, moderately, super-affirmed to that. We've got to wait and see on that. First one headlines. Let's get you up to speed. Let's choose the morning. We've been talking about COVID. We'll shine as daily COVID infections have climbed to near the highest on record. More than 27,000 new cases were reported for Monday. It left officials facing confusion about whether to use SNAP lockdowns and mass testing. This is Beijing trying to soften the economic impact of COVID-0. How authorities have outlined plans to boost hospital capacity in the sign that they're expecting even higher case numbers?

Seven European football teams have decided against wearing rainbow on bands at the World Cup to show solidarity with the LGBTQ rights.

As we work to bring policy to what we call a sufficiently restrictive stance, which really in simple terms means the level required to bring inflation down and restore price stability. We will need to be mindful. Adjusting to little will leave inflation too high, and adjusting too much could lead to an unnecessarily painful downturn. San Francisco, President of the American Daily, urging policy makers to be mindful as the rate hikes roll in. Trade is adjusting the latest Fed speak, China's next steps, and the country's new COVID cases are near a record in this pandemic. A lot to digest. Alan Marcus is fab managing director, head of asset management. joins us now. Good to have you with us. It's the perennial debate about where is the terminal rate. Daily talks about being a rate that is sufficiently restrictive. When you see freight prices dying by 75%, when you see lumber prices demolished and home starts imploding. Do you think they should pause now at 4%. Well we've seen as we suggested, food price inflation has come down, and as you said, those other measures also coming down. But it doesn't mean to say that the inflation battle is beaten yet. And we are in this period of very sticky inflation. Terminal rate certainly in our opinion is 4 and 3,5. Well above what we said six months ago at the same time. Earnings suggest that the Fed still has a dry powder, so to speak, in terms of trying to normalize the rate in order to tackle inflation. So we will have higher rates for longer, even if we do get to a point where things start coming down a little bit. How credible are the equity market moves in response to what the Fed is going to do to the geopolitics, to the weakness in China? And is this maybe a point to say, hey, we might have actually hit the process of bottoming up. Well, CEOs have been quite gloomy in terms of their outlook for next year, 2023 earnings estimates don't look too good. And the markets obviously fearing that the recession could be a lot more protracted, a lot more deeper in certain parts of the world. The earnings season was pretty decent overall. And I think the markets are more focused on what the outlooks have been, which have been quite negative. Higher for longer. And yet, Master talks about the cadence. The cadence is the word that she used yesterday, which I think is quite interesting. The market is coalescing around 50 basis points in the December meeting. But the cadence, do you see longer intervals between the hikes next year and a little bit more digestion of information? So rather than deeply front loading 50, 25, 25, 25, 25, do you see a different cadence, perhaps to what we've all assumed? Well, in terms of previous rate hikes, rather than raising rates every single month, we may get to a place where you have a couple of hikes per quarter. As you know, the market's priced in 50 for December. Yep. Two lots of 25s going into Q1. And then we'll see where we are. Maybe by Q2, we level off a little bit. They made pause, but it doesn't mean to say that rates will start coming down either. We are in this period that inflation is still very much interrupted. And the supply chain disruption is still not over. The market's life team has been doing some deeper thinking, as they always do, might I say. This time around, they're doing the market's life pulse around the question of what's going to be the next major catalyst? Not the smaller moves, because the S&P 500 has been stuck around the 1% level in the upside or down sign in the last seven trading sessions. But what's going to be the next major shift for global markets? Is it going to be geopolitical conflict, US CPI cooling to less than 3% or skyrocket to 10% or maybe something completely different? I think CPI numbers are going to stay where we are, around 6-7% if you look.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1744,2022-11-22 05:22:50
19131," So 3% or skyrocket to 10% or maybe something completely different? I think CPI numbers are going to stay where we are, sort of around a 6-7% if you look forward, say 6-12 months time. Geopolitical wise, we've still got some umming and eyeing about the oil markets as you've covered in your stories, but also the Iranian question in terms of supply chain, sorry, supply of crude oil into the market still very much could be alive and that could actually be a positive for the markets. We don't have a deal yet, but certainly the invisible hand, so to speak, in terms of what's going to happen next year, isn't too apparent to us. We worry about the fed or other central banks going a bit too far, with rate hikes, but as we've seen in the past central banks generally overreact to the negative or to the positive. I think that's probably a little bit more to do with J.P. how wanted to be Volca rather than Arthur Burns. You know what happened to Pearl D'Arthag? Got it a bit wrong. Nobody really knows whether there's a recession actually. I was looking at this, New York Fed 23%, Cleveland Fed 25%, Bloomberg. Our estimate is 100% probability of a recession. Hi, Prokhor Willett B, and where do you take protection? Do you reduce US equity exposure or do you hold firm to the belief? I think it's a given that the markets are slowing down dramatically from where we were in previous quarters. A shallow recession, but a more protracted recession, I think is the bigger worry. If you look at the UK for example, it's going to be all year for 2023 going forward. In terms of where you pitch yourselves in the market, so we still think yields are beginning to look very attractive now in the bond market. At some stage in Q1, it may be an idea to add on the investment grade side, as we've said previously. On the equity side, we need to see the shakeout value has obviously outperformed growth considerably, and I think at some point growth will come back, given valuations have fallen quite dramatically in 22. The greenback is after three day winning streak. You're still bullish on the Bloomberg dollar index and sort of the dollar more broadly. I'm wondering what kind of cash cushion you have been dollars or otherwise, and that you may deploy in the next few weeks as the opportunities arise, maybe in equity. So it's a de-risk mix of asset classes in bills, cash, and sort of short-duration bonds on fixed income equities. We've stuck to value overall. The dollar index seems to be holding around the 106107 area, and I think if it bounces back, it will bounce back to try the one 10 area again. Given that rates will continue to rise faster in the Federal Reserve than they will at other central banks. So we're in the status quo of it's more of the same, and you have to stick to sort of very nimble investing. The Middle East certainly looks attractive and we've had a blockbuster IPO in America on a recently, and the market's rotating to obviously very high oil prices, which looks a good diversifier to us. All right, we leave it there. Always a keen to get your insights. Thanks for that. That's Alan Marcus, the FAB Managing Director and Head of Asset Management.

That's your Bloomberg business flash. I want to take you back to the big picture view on Middle East equities, a broadly negative picture in the previous trading session with losses led by the Tadaule, the lower energy price. Fact was factored in there and that is likely to continue to weigh on sentiment.

San Francisco's Mary Daily repeats that she sees interest rates rising to at least 5%. Plus Tesla in the tailspin, traders are anxious after city nebeging returns to lockdown, putting both production and sales at risk. Let's see how these markets are fairing. We are nervous in terms of the renewed lockdown risk in China. Annabelle is in Hong Kong with the very latest. We go from ecstasy to agony on a daily basis in terms of understanding the narrative from China. That's right. It's a very difficult one to chart menace certainly. But in terms of what we're watching this afternoon as we head into the afternoon session here in Asia. So we're actually seeing a bit of cautious optimism creeping back in. That's what I'd say here. Basically that's being most reflected in in part in the currency space. So we actually had seen dollars strength that's now giving up a bit of softness coming back in and the likes of the yuan rising here around 3.10%. It's also playing out in what we're seeing in the equity space given we do have the NICA also up around 7.10%. And the CSI 300 still clicking on to those gains of half a percent. But yes, as you say, it really is down to this uncertainty around what China will do in the face of COVID cases that are rising there 27,000 or just a notch over that reported in the last 24-hour period. The other sector we're watching today is what's happening in China tech. This is a different story though. If you just change on now and take a look at how JD.com is trading in the afternoon. So we are seeing it extend those losses now down more than 3% in the broader tech sector selling off in tandem. Now we did actually have a red headline crossing earlier. Essentially we understand that JD.com could be planning to cut salaries for managers to up to 20%. Now those that funds, well those funds will be redirected into staff benefits. And actually the company CEO himself is said to be also putting a 14 million dollars of his own money into these benefits. So this really comes down to one of the signature policy drives from the president Dan Xi Jinping, which is common prosperity use F. And then briefly, can you run us through the deadline that Malaysia is facing to name a new prime minister? What are markets bracing for? Yeah, so just to give a bit of context here in less than 30 minutes from now, that is the deadline set by the Malaysian king for lawmakers to name who will be the next prime minister. We did have that election over the weekend producing the first hung parliament ever. Now in terms of what markets are expecting, there's a few different views coming in from this city banks take. So essentially they're saying that firstly, a PN lead government is a bit of a surprise. They weren't expecting other coalitions or major parties, BN and PH to give up so much ground, but essentially a PN lead government would maintain a populist slant. They did actually promise in their election manifesto the most fiscal spending. The concern here is that could put some pressure on the fiscal deficit also around inflation concerns as they expect the central bank to be sticking to a hawkish bias. If you just change on now quickly, see what may bank is expecting instead. Essentially they say markets are ready for any outcome here. They're still recommending a focus on health here, consumer staples, financials and tech and they're expecting growth.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1747,2022-11-22 05:35:42

Lubric, certainly, it has the latest requirement. So, Jules, how is this likely to evolve in the next few hours? Well, it's less than 30 minutes now, Yusuf for the King's deadline for either party to say that they have formed an alliance. And it's coming down to the former ruling coalition, BN Annabelle, just telling us a few of the details there. And of course, a key number of this dates like Parangang and Parak and also the island nations of Borneo. So, really a lot of deal-making you would assume has been happening since Saturday's election, which resulted in Malaysia's first ever hung parliament. Anway Ibrahim Confident that he will get the 112 seats needed, but that does mean that he needs to form this alliance with the former foes of BN. And we have heard that they have been meeting with Anway Ibrahim's Pakistan Harapan party today, but also BN could go with the pro-Malay Islamist party PN and form a government with them. So, we could remain in opposition. It's interesting too that the police chief of Malaysia has really warned against social media being used to promote hate speech if we continue to see a political gridlock here. And just adding to this political uncertainty that has really dogged Malaysia over the last four years, Yusuf Manus. Good to see you out and about. Good to see you ahead in the story. We'll see you through the morning. For the first full day of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar got underway. Iran versus England, the Netherlands versus Senegal, and the US took on, well, Simone Foxman is in Doha. So Simone, again, some talk of major developments from Qatar today. This is on the LNG front. Yeah, that's right. Let's focus on the World Cup first before I take you through the LNG where a major deal was signed. But on the pitch, we were watching specifically the England, Iran game. There was a lot of controversy in the lead up to this event, especially how Iranian players might or might not express support for demonstrations at home. And they delivered. They didn't sing the national anthem. And that was seen as expressing that support for protesters back in the country. Also in the stands pretty, I mean, it was clear that there were people protesting as well. Some brought Persian flags, apparently those flags. In some cases were taken away. Others sang the Persian national anthem. Again, this is anti-regime. And as well, there were signs saying women life freedom, the slogan that has defined so many of these protests. Also, I was walking around in the streets. You know, I want to say that the vibe was much more busy than things had been on Sunday. And that obviously good for Qatar's ambitions to turn this into a tourist juggernaut. What are some of the key events expected today on and off the pitch, Simone? I talked a lot of fans that are very excited for the Argentina, Saudi game to be played in Los Alistair stadium. But for the most part, these games today, much less political, much less controversial. That said, we do expect to see US Secretary of State meeting the Qatar's foreign minister to open a US strategic, US Qatar strategic dialogue. Not expecting a lot of massive headlines out of that, but something to watch. We're also going to be continuing to carefully watch expressions of LGBTQ rights. We were told that some people were turned away from various venues for wearing rainbow colored hats, rainbow colored shirts. Various issues developing there. There were also some ticketing issues. Those are kind of top of mind two things that we're going to be looking out for today. Say the best of last. What was the deal that they signed?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1748,2022-11-22 05:40:03
19135," issues. Those are kind of top of mind two things that we're going to be looking out for today. Save the best of last. What was the deal that they signed with China's sign-up act then? Yeah, let's start with the we started with the football we get to the LNG. Sign-up acts signing a $60 billion deal with Qatar energy to supply some four million tons of LNG. Well, Zubai four million tons of LNG from Qatar energy each year starting in 2026 as going to last through 27 years. So that's a pretty lengthy deal. And it's just very notable given all the attention, the global attention on Qatar right now. Who is signing the very first agreement for the supply that Qatar is going to produce with its massive LNG expansion project? It's going to Asia despite the fact that Europe is looking for replacements for Russian natural gas. It's going to Asia. It's not going to Europe guys. Simone, thanks for that. That's Simone Foxman at the Qatar Financial Center in Doha. Now with Revenge Tourism in full swing and the World Cup bringing more people to Dubai, how are the airlines coping with this surge in demand? Let's speak to Paul Griffith, he's the CEO of Dubai Airport. So Paul, what's changed for you in terms of the activity through the airports, through the terminals, as a result of the World Cup? What is the data telling you? Well, we've got about 120 flights in and out every day between DWC and Qatar. We're expecting Q4, DWC, to be about 494,000 passengers. So I think the contribution that the airports are making to attendance at the World Cup is quite considerable. Are those flights full? 494,000 is what we're expecting. It really depends on the playoffs and how we end up through the tournament. I think it's pretty popular at the moment. They're certainly operating. Would you say you've scaled enough to accommodate the inbound waves of travel? Or would you say that there could have been a little bit more done either from the airlines or from the airport infrastructure side? No, I think we've scaled perfectly. Probably more by judgment than luck, fortunately. By keeping, I think, most of our resources in play, because we always knew that the rebound of travel would be pretty quick. You can't lock down 3.9 billion people across the world under some form of lockdown for over a two-year period. Without there being a pretty resolute number of people wanting to get back onto airplanes at the end of that. You're going to have the numbers, 18.5 million in the quarter. So we're back at pre-pandemic levels. You have to have an eye-spend every day, pre-varicating over where the China is reopening, stepping back and quarantine. We even went on the Emirates site this morning, still no flights up there. We can't get a flight to China even yet. Even platinum members? Even platinum. I don't even know whether I've turned gold or platinum. When that rush comes, and I don't think anybody really understands when that exactly will be, how much more can that add to the throughput? Because you're right. They've been locked up for two, three years now. So what will China reopening? What are the models tell you we will get? Well, the thing is, China is obviously an incredibly important market for us. In a growing market, it has been over the last few years. There's a lack of frequency, obviously, at the moment, because China's being closed. But actually, most of South Asian recovery has been pretty sluggish over the last few months, which is why our transfer numbers are slightly behind where they need to be. About 72 percent of total traffic is transferred. So the point-to-point market to Dubai has been absolutely brilliant, though, over the last year. In fact, last December, we were at a hundred and nineteen percent of pre-pandemic levels in terms of visitors to Dubai. So the slow recovery in some of the transfer markets has been more than compensated by visitors to the city and the economic multiplier of that for Dubai is obviously very significant. I mean, it looks like we're on a bullet train into a recession 2023. How do you build resiliency in the Dubai International Infrastructure and Business Model to get you through that? This is not your first downturn. You come from quite a bit of experience in",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1749,2022-11-22 05:44:22
19136," Ziliency in the Dubai International Infrastructure and Business Model to get you through that, this is not your first downturn, you come from quite a bit of experience in the industry over many decades, how would you do it differently this time around? Well, I think we're in the very fortunate position to have a very effective and efficient business model now. Our capacity, we think we can get to about 118 million passengers a year without a huge investment in infrastructure and we're looking at that at the moment because if we can actually sustain that level of capacity at DXB, that means we've still got a significant headroom without adding additional operating costs. So I think we're in pretty good shape to weather whatever the recession throws at us, but obviously I think at the moment demand is so strong, there's some shortages on the supply side as airlines have rationalised their fleet. So we're seeing a bit of a boom in air travel which hopefully will carry us through a recessive situation if we end up there. We look at the release India, Saudi and the UK in terms of numbers, 6.8, 3.4 and 3.2. We're looking at sterling against the Durham. Yes, they may welcome flooding in, no, this will be the last hurrah one could say from the UK. Is that a risk to the business in 2023, the plummet and sterling and a recession which is marked up by the bank of England? How big a risk is your number three market for 2023? I think what's happened is the economy here has diversified significantly and you're not just seeing people coming to visit. There's a great influx of people who are actually seeing the UAE and Dubai in particular as a very attractive place to be based. So a lot of people take in the opportunity of increased mobility and obviously being able to operate remotely to base themselves here in the sunshine. And if you compare the weather, not just the sterling currency in the UK with what's happening here at the moment, you can see why that would be attractive. How much of connecting traffic in the meantime is coming through DXB from Russia? And how do you expect that to shift as the geopolitics play out vis-a-vis Russia in Britain? Obviously, we still have operations to and from Russia and those flights are incredibly full at the moment. So there's a lot of interest in going backwards and forwards as we're operating one of the major corridors. Obviously the political situation is very difficult at the moment and we'll have to see how that changes over time. But for the moment demand is very strong. One of the other anomalies of war is that you have trouble or difficulty for US carriers over Russian airspace. And this is something we just channelled about before the show. Has that meant anything strategically different in terms of those redirected flights from India? Are you seeing an up-tick from India as a result of that? Well I think obviously flight routines have had to change but fortunately the geographic position that we hold means that that hasn't been a huge deviation from operations between Russia and Dubai. And obviously transfer traffic that has now other way of getting there is seeing Dubai is a very attractive hub. Your busiest route at the moment is what? The busiest one in the world is rear Dubai, isn't it? It's the second busiest at the moment, that's right, yes. And how does that change into 2023 or do you think that sustain is given the boom we're seeing in the kingdom? I think KSA traffic is going to be the big success story actually of next year. KSA traffic is increasing quite significantly to all points in Saudi Arabia. And I think actually the two cities, major cities between here and ReAD, are going to see very significant increase in numbers. It's a conference over there that I'm speaking at to encourage tourists in between the two countries and we see them as a very good opportunity to boost travel to the GCC overall. Shall we give it one last try? Yeah, there's a slate of 10 IPOs, you got back with a bang, you're roaring on all cylinders, surely you must have a new valuation for the business and is there any discussion about doing an IPO for the business? All I can say is that airport value",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1750,2022-11-22 05:48:39
19137," valuation for the business and is there any discussion about doing an IPO for the business? All I can say is that airport valuations across the world in particular those that have gone to the market's post pandemic have been very very encouraging. Does that wet your up? I think that's an evolution from last time. No, let's just push them one more. That mean we're getting closer to the edge of an IPO. But realistically 2023 is it something you will have a firm conversation about? I don't think it's my pay grade to start a live on television so I think you'll have to get my business. I mean I'd be willing to bet on it. We're embedding more with the world cover stuff. I put money on to my airport. It's coming to market in 2023. You know what he's got to do? He just got to send Shake Archmede and then we can put him on this spot. Paul, thank you very much. Paul Griffiths, definitely dealing with the questions for the IPO Slater roster. The CEO of Dubai Airports, Plenty More Head on Daybreak Middle East. This is Blinberg. We will never break. We will never break. Build on a foundation. Strong enough to stay. We will never. That's a stick with IPO's. The Middle East markets need to be well dissected. Our equity expert, Farah Abahar, joins us for the sex size. Morgan Stanley has an outlook on the banking sector. Morgan Stanley prefers SNB, Saudi, British bank and Riyadh bank. You said that's due to their higher sensitivity to the rising interest rates as well as their higher liquidity and capital in general. But still if you just take a look at Morgan Stanley's note from yesterday, they said that margins will actually be peaking for every single bank in Saudi Arabia by the first quarter except for banks Saudi-Frenzhi and Arashhi-Kapita. At the same time, they also think that EPS will be 6% lower than they expected for 2023. Looking at what's happening with the Tadal right now, it's actually set for the worst year since 2015. That's pretty major for an index that's been leading for so many years when you compare it with emerging markets and with oil pulling back with all the uncertainty about OPEC. And banks leading for so many years, this is a space to keep an eye out on for sure. So, Pizzahut, Baskin Robbins, Pizzahut and there's a few others. I don't really feel with that. This is 19 AG9. Me too. Yep, there you go. That was the last KFC that I had. We alive in 1989. Yeah, I was. I was through what I was doing there. Shep is Bush Rinderbite. Come on, what's going on with the Marri-Can-I IPO? What's the news? Americana. It looks at two rates, $1.8 billion, Manus and its IPO. That's been really highly anticipated.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1751,2022-11-22 05:53:04
19138," What's the news? American look said to raise $1.8 billion dollars, man, as in its IPO. That's been really highly anticipated. And the reason that I'm personally very excited for this one is it's going to be a dual listing. The first one we get between Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia. So we've seen them raise the offering for the retail price for the retail sector. So certainly there is a lot of demand for this one. And it's a household name. So again, now that we know that or at least looks set to price at the top end of the range, the first day of trading is going to be the key milestone for Americana. I know you've got a detailed agenda in terms of IPO items that you need to stay across. Could you pass this on to our global audience? What is it? Well, it's been just so busy. But the most recent one, it was actually, it came from Reuters. They said that the public investment fund in Saudi Arabia, has hired Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Saudi National Banks Investment Banking Arm, as well as EFG or Mazz for the IPO of ADES, which is an oil and gas driller. Again, we're just discussing what's happening with the commodity space. And while there has been demand moving into next year, how that shifts in the investment space here in the Gulf, if you're we're bringing more and more energy plays, how that will affect these IPO's coming to the table, it's going to look set to be a $1 billion IPO. So again, not a small one. And it's coming from the P.A.F, which the market typically trusts their investments as well, at least in Saudi Arabia. So a key one to watch out for. OK, Farah, thank you very much. Get out there, get yourself a TGI F. A little bit of KFC. Farah, thank you very much. Farah, I'll borrow your guy with the red legs. On the equity markets, the IPO train keeps on rolling right here and the GCC on Bloomberg. The top names in climate change are on Bloomberg. Building out local wind, local solar, hydrogen, these are solutions to not just climate issues, but geopolitical issues. We are in a position by 2030 to have 80% of all electricity generated by wind. Renewables are the safest, the cleanest, and the cheapest form of energy today, especially for countries such as Greece. Nobody covers climate change like Bloomberg, your global business authority. This is a market that over the past few weeks has made it clear it wants to go higher. It got a little spooked by the idea that geopolitical is going to be a potential horizon. I want to check in on the markets again for you and talk about Coinbase because it's getting sliced and diced that $41 a share in after our trade. But what's set out to me was that you've got woods, arc investment management funds buying on the 1.3 million shares of Coinbase. It's the start of November. That's about $56 million based on Monday's trading price. It's according to data compiled by Bloomberg. So Kathy Wood from these arc funds has been snapping up shares as the crypto world gets shaken by what is going on with. Genesis in terms of potential bankruptcy of the cryptocurrency brokerage and the FTX cataclysmic disasters. There's no other way of putting it, man. It says there. Yep, are in terms of the latest information the bank.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1752,2022-11-22 05:57:17
19139," Cryptocurrency brokerage and the FTX cataclysmic disasters. Is not the way of putting it, man. Is this there? Yeah, in terms of the latest information, the bankruptcy shows a cash balance of 1.2 for billion. But this is the crypto world, the crypto complex at the moment. As you can see, Bitcoin firmly below 16,000. Contasion is rife as you see. Genesis warning of bankruptcy, if they don't get funds, they had about $175 million locked inside the FTX world. Solano up 610 to 1% in the FTX, token itself down to 610 to 1%. The US regulators, now, we're hearing senators step into this, not the regulators, but politicos. Fidelity must reconsider Bitcoin exposure in 401Ks. That's the latest nuance, political twist from the senators on Capitol Hill. Yeah, we'll, of course, be discussing this for many more weeks, for sure. I want to flip the board and get to your equity futures. You've got the Fed voices chipping in once again in the last few hours on where they see the terminal rate and the Fed moves into the new year. But JP Morgan is now saying that the Fed needs to cut rates before asset prices can actually rise. BlackRock favoring stocks over bonds in the next decade on the S&P 500 mini. We're just turning negative in the last 15 minutes. The coverage continues from Dubai, London, and the rest of the world. This is Bloomberg. Nutruring also can come from men, and it's one of the qualities, I guess, that you found in your mentors that also pushed you up. Do we need even more nurturing post-pandemic? Is the way that we talk with employees going to change? I think talent becomes the single biggest differentiator of a successful entity versus an unsuccessful entity. So you've got to do everything possible to hire, train, retain, put your arms around talent. You really got to focus on your talent. In the past, it's always been given money. Show them that they have upward mobility and can make even more money, and that's the only reason people come to work. I think post-pandemic, we're seeing more and more people say, I have to worry about me as a person. I have to worry about my family. I want to worry about my well-being, my mental health. So we've got to start encompassing people as holistic humans as opposed to the tool of the train, which means that we have to engage with their head, heart, and hands. Not just head and hands, the heart has been engaged. So we have to be sure more empathy, show that we care that the citizens of the community, your members of the family, and all of those have to come into consideration as we help an executive or an employee, be an employee and be a pus to the community in the family. The stakes are higher. We're in the early stages of a sustainability revolution that has the magnitude of the industrial revolution coupled with the speed of the digital revolution. Nobody covers climate change like Bloomberg, your global business authority. This is really a reminder, isn't it, just how sensitive the markets are to any commentary about trade. We did see pressure in the U.N., we did see pressure in the future. That is now being reversed.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1753,2022-11-22 06:01:51
19140," This is really a reminder isn't it just how sensitive the markets are to any commentary about trade. We did see pressure on the U.A. and we did see some pressure on the future. That is now being reversed. This is Bloomberg Daybreak. You're up on Son McKenzie in London with Manus Cranny in Dubai and these. Are the stories that set your agenda? Dunshiff Gaines Momentum, the Fed's merry daily warns about the lag effects of rate hikes. While the Red Amastor says 75 basis points isn't needed next month, stocks are mostly higher. FTX4 like Crypto firm Genesis warns of bankruptcy as it struggles to raise cash. US prosecutors began probing some bankman-free empire months before its collapse. Plus, keeping the lid on, oil whipsaws, the Saudi Arabia denies a report saying OPEC-plus is weighing a production increase at the December meeting. Tom Good Morning, I mean that oil market was vicious, done by 6% and then bang the big denial. Tom Good Morning. Yeah, that was remarkable isn't it? The moves in Brent WTI on the back of that speculation, the reporting that an increase was in the offing as you say a very strong denial from Saudi Arabia. We continue as well to look at what is and what is the commentary from these Fed officials then. There is no backing down from higher rates and a higher terminal rate but is just how high they go come December and in the months that follow that is in question slightly more dubbish arguably in terms of the size of these hikes, Manus. I like the Red Amastor's use of language. She refers to the cadence. The Fed can know, don't shift from 75, we are in a new cadence and what does that mean in terms of the interval between the next set of hikes and of course that builds on Bostek so you've got Bostek, Master and Mary Daley all cooling a little bit in a dubb. A cacophony of doves, there you go, triple C. A cacophony of doves. JP Morgan's Clanavitch as well of course, the ultimate ball at the beginning of this year saying that actually you're not going to see a significant tick up in these risk assets until you get not a pause but a cut from the Fed Reserve. We'll have a look at these markets then as we weigh up some of this commentary and also what is happening in China. Just a reminder, this is the context you are looking at about a fifth of that economy that is facing COVID controls now in China. Now the MSI Asia Pacific actually notching up gaze of just three tenths of a percent. The future stateside broadly balanced, not a lot of movement. You saw some modest losses yesterday both in the US and Europe as well. Officials in Europe are also sounding a little dovish, fill up lane as well suggesting that maybe a tick down to 50 basis points from the ECB is appropriate at this time. That's that futures unchanged and Eurostock's futures pointing to a very modest gain of about a tenth of a percent. Manus. Yeah, who blinks first is the Fed of the governments when it comes to the pain needed to take inflation done. Quick snapshot, oil is rebinder from a 6 percent trashing yesterday. The dollar has halted a three day rally as we see this new cadence language coming from the Fed. You're looking at two-year yields dropping ever since slightly 4.49 percent where we're going in terms of hard landing and Brent just pausing for breath up to tenths of 1 percent this morning. As RBC says, OPEC is likely to err on the side of caution as we go to Vienna and Bitcoin scrambling for breath of 15,771 is the money flowing into Bitcoin as a result of FTX. That is the moot. Tom. Okay, let's get to one of the other big corporate stories of the moment. Elon Musk laying off more Twitter workers from the sales side of the business. Further trimming a headcount already diminished, of course, by cuts and resignations. Elsewhere for masks signs that China is increasing COVID-0 curbs, as I mentioned, rather than removing them, is adding to a litany of investor worries over Tesla. Joining us with more is Katrina. Nicholas in Singapore. Katrina, what are the other factors then that are weighing on Tesla? You've got the China effect. You've got the concern about just how much attention Elon Musk is able actually to pay to Tesla.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1754,2022-11-22 06:06:04
19141," On Tesla, you've got the China effect. You've got the concern about just how much attention Elon Musk is able actually to pay to Tesla. Exactly. And you know, China is Tesla's most important market after the US. It recently upgraded its factory there in Shanghai to double capacity to about a million cars a year. And last month, it shipped about 72,000 electric vehicles from that plant. That's a lot of supply that's going into the market. At a time when consumer sentiment may not be as strong as it was and amid recession worries. So that's one concern. Another is this recall of about 300,000 cars due to faulty tail lights. And that was in the US over the weekend. And unfortunately, that was something that was able to be rectified via an over-the-air software update. But again, not helping the stock in any way. It's down about 52% this year. And that puts it at levels not seen since November 2020. The debate is, to what extent do you have to discount Elon Musk's, as opposed, focus on Twitter, focus on SpaceX? It's already in there in the securities disclosure that he has other interests. And that may distract him. Is the Elon discount coming to bite? Well, I think that could be what you are seeing here. I mean, Musk has been certainly preoccupied by his newly acquired social media platform, tweeting at all hours, leading some investors to worry that Tesla's strategy may have sort of fallen by the wayside. There was an analyst recently Jeffrey Osborne from Cohen. And he wrote that hedge funds also seem to be shifting to something of a negative bias on Tesla since Elon acquired Twitter. Due to the risk that there has been this loss of focus, Tesla did lose its trillion dollar valuation status in late April. And now it shares only need to fall another about 6% before it dips below that $500 billion mark. OK, well, we're keeping an eye on it today, because it's certainly taken a little bit of wind out of Elon's wealth at losing over $100 billion this year. Katrina, thank you very much. Katrina Nicholas, with the very latest on Twitter and Elon Musk's empire. Well, as you've talked, modestly higher in the afternoon session, let's get across to Annabelle Drew, as she's tracking the moves. I suppose Annabelle comes down to no further bad news on lockdowns is maybe what the market is desperately clinging on to. Yeah, that seems to be the story, man. It's sort of difficult to weave a narrative into the session today because we have been pretty range bound really. In terms of what we're watching, well, the NICA is advancing in the session today. The week Yen had been something supporting that in the days trading. Otherwise, the CSI 300 now shifting to flat. It was earlier high by as much as 710%. There are two main stories as well. In addition to those COVID restrictions that we're monitoring, firstly cases, yes, they had come in more than 27,000. So we're back to the levels of the highest of the pandemic, but also China giving more support to its property sector in that it's telling regulators to stabilize banking loans to a developer and also to construction firms. So that was something that had been lifting this sector here by as much as 2.5%. And then we're also keeping an eye on how companies are continuing to respond to the signature policies of Xi Jinping. JDCOM is one of them are basically saying it's going to be a cutting management salary. The other story we're watching today in Asia is what's happening in Malaysia. Given we did have that election over at the weekend, and it produced a hung parliament. Now, lawmakers have been given the deadline of 6am London time, where you are, of course, Tom, to tell the king who would be the next Prime Minister. We are still awaiting the outcome of that. What we do understand so far that be and is saying it's going to be part of the opposition that would lead a PN or an MP parliament to be the majority coalition there. OK, fantastic. So we're just speaking to Freda Newman of HSBC about the Malaysian economy later in the show as well. Annabelle Drewler, thank you for a wrap of the Asian markets. Let's get to the story that, frankly, is Manus' favorite story of the hour oil studying, after a wild ride, following conflicting reports, of possible OPEC output increases. And as traders continue to weigh the demand.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1755,2022-11-22 06:10:26
19142," and I say his favorite story of the hour oil, steady after a wild ride following conflicting reports of possible OPEC output increases. And as traders continue to weigh the demand picture in China, which is looking pretty fragile right now. Our energy reports of Stephen Stubtsinsky has more. Stephen, just walk us through what's happened in the last 24 hours in these oil markets. Well, we first had is we had the journal report that Saudi Arabia was gonna add oil back to the market, potentially with an OPEC plus increasing supply in their next decision by 500,000 barrels a day. They had cut it by millions of barrels before that. So that would be a surprise decision. Oil prices plummeted. You saw WTI fall essentially $6. Then Saudi Arabia came out surprise the market again and said, that's not true. We're not considering that. And then prices jump back up and they ended the session little changed. Now we're in the situation where traders don't know how to weigh it because we are in a crossroads. The market is looking at China. Chinese demand is weak. They continue to have these lockdowns across the country with COVID cases rising. That has everyone worried that the world's biggest crude importer won't have much demand over the next few months, adding more supply into the market. At the same time, the EU is going to execute a Russian price cap to stop Moscow from getting money over the war in Ukraine. That's going to be implemented in December. And Russia warned that they were going to essentially reduce output with if the customers are putting a price cap. They're not going to sell to those countries. And that could also maybe potentially tighten the market. So you have these two tightrope to be walking between bearish and bullish elements. Traders don't know what to do. And Saudi Arabia as well with OPEC plus decision coming up in December has to also navigate that difficult situation. And that's where we stand. OK, and we will talk a little bit more later on in the show on the LNG contract, Symitin Kata, and the East, which is a very big message for global energy markets. Stephen, thank you very much, Stephen. Stepchinsky there with the very latest force on the volatility in the oil market. Tom, we're going to talk about FTX. The contagion effect is now... We're able to put a little bit of quantum around this. So we know that Genesis, which is another one of these exchanges, has worn... We're going to be bankrupt if we don't raise funds. And then part of the reason is because part of our capital is trapped inside FTX, which is $175 million, is locked inside an FTX account. They have no plans. I've got to say this very, very clearly. We have no plans to file for bankruptcy imminently, but they are trying to raise funds. Yes, so this is Genesis, as you say, a brokerage and it has a lending unit. That's where the concern is. Genesis link to Gemini as well. They do business together, Gemini owned by the Winklevoss twins. So there's another linkage in this sprawling web of connections to FTX. Also, the development as well that we mentioned, Manus, around the DOJ, at least regulators, officials in the U.S. and New York, I believe, who had in the months previous to this fallout and collapse of FTX actually started probing the business. So that is interesting as well. I'm waiting for new details around that. A latest line as well on the reporting. Around FTX Group, apparently they have a cash balance of around $1.2 billion U.S. But we know that Sandbank-Prinfrid said there's about an $8 billion whole. So some gaps still. And again, more details coming through as we unpick this web and regulator starts to probe, Manus. Yeah, I mean, the combined cash balance of $1.24 billion. And then if you look inside Alameda Research and the radio firms, they had cash balance of $401 million. I think the other really important line here is that you've got senators now coming out in the U.S. Fidelity must reconsider Bitcoin exposure in people's 401k. So again, another salvo coming in the form of, let's say that, but a Cathy Wood never far. I mean, you caught up with her recently, so you can tell me whether this is another road of the dice for her. She's buying up Coinbase. I mean, ARK funds now have increased their position by 19%. In Coinbase. And that's certainly what you call jumping on the opportunity, isn't it Tom? I mean, when I spoke to her, and this will leave a lot of people saying, you know, scratching their heads, she reiterated their call that ultimately Bitcoin can get to a million dollars per coin. I mean, given all of this.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1756,2022-11-22 06:14:47
19143," When I spoke to her and this will leave a lot of people said, you know, scratching their heads. She reiterated their call that ultimately Bitcoin can get to a million dollars per coin. I mean, given all of this, there's a pretty remarkable, remarkable proposition and forecast for Bitcoin. Currently, as you say, you're seeing a little bit of a bid for the biggest cryptocurrency currently up just 7.10 of 8% matters. Bit of a journey then, Tom. OK, coming up and they show the Fed officials have broadly maintained their steadfast stance in the fight against inflation, but JP Morgan's Kalanavitch sees more dime-side risks until the Fed stops hiking. We'll discuss on Brinberg. COVID has changed everything. People are changing the way they work and the way they travel. Can you explain what you mean? I think the world is never going back to the way it was fully before the pandemic. And one of the changes I think, David, has been a change in how we work. Many people had a job at an office. They're not going to be required to come back to the office five days a week. And I think that I don't think CEOs per se are going to determine these policies. I think workers will, because all of us CEOs, I think, want the best talent. And I think flexibility is going to be the second most important benefit after compensation. All of this, David, has culminated in the Airbnb not just being a company about traveling, but now a company about living. So this is a whole new category of travel that's not classic two, three nights in a city. It's not long-term housing and it's completely emerged because of the pandemic. As we work to bring policy to what we call a sufficiently restrictive stance, which really in simple terms means the level required to bring inflation down and restore price stability, we will need to be mindful. Adjusting to little will leave inflation too high and adjusting too much could lead to an unnecessarily painful downturn. That sounds like Mary Daley's looking for gold elox in terms of rates that San Francisco, Fed President Mary Daley coming through with her view and speaking about the potential impact of Fed policy. Her Cleveland counterpart, Loretta Master, said she's open to slowing the pace of rate hikes. Meanwhile, JP Morgan's, Kelanavitch says the Fed will need to start reducing interest rates for the to be a sustained rally in risky as is, but that's not likely any time soon. So let's take that confidence or thought to Stephanie Zwick, senior portfolio manager at fish at fish asset management. Great to have you with us this morning and drawn to Master's reference on the cadence. She talks about cadence of rate hikes that we're going to have. What does that mean to you 50 basis points in December and thereafter? What would you project on a new cadence? So I think the pet will become much more flexible and predictable. I think actually after the lower CPI prints in October, which is really surprised to the downside. I expect some more cooling coming also beginning of December and this will leave a bit more leeway for the Fed to act. So here I think the Fed will actually.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1757,2022-11-22 06:18:53
19144," Cooling coming also beginning of December and this will leave a bit more leeway for the fat to act So here I think the fat will actually pause starting in January so they will probably hike in December But after that they will rather digest the cooling inflation figures and trade a bit longer So we will have higher rates for longer But the positive here is this will be much more digestible for equity valuations because it's also on the same time becoming more predictable less data dependent That's a big call Stephanie that they're going to pause after a December hike does that suggest it sounds like you would push back on on Kalanavitches call that you need to see a cut before you're going to see any sustained rally in risk assets Yes, actually I really think that the the the inflation figures are cooling and there will be some basic facts So actually the fat will still be committed to taming inflation But they will probably take more time so they will they will rise rate rates over longer period and not not in a hurry So you've decided to to join BlackRock and the chorus in terms of wanting to get on the credit bus Where am I sufficiently compensated to get on board the credit bus So I think fixed income investors right now are not well compensated by taking on additional risks First of all in years investment rate corpus you currently earn a year towards around 5% which is even above the current earning yield of the S&P So here that's actually true alternative for equities on top you don't really see a get a pickup towards emerging markets If you look at investment rate emerging market uh spreads usually they were trading as with a pickup to investment grade corpus but right now this pickup really has disappeared So I think right now really investors should stay focused on US and also your investment grade corpus Stephanie if you were to push out into high yields Where would you where would you be looking within this environment I think energy really offers rising stars so actually currently um as we have recessionary pressures we favor defensive sectors with stable cash flows such as talcos but also health care companies Um we are underweight cyclicals and that's what is interesting so energy had historically been a very cyclical sector High bidder sector but today energy is really offering stable cash flows um cash rich companies are strong uh fundamentals So here we are really keen on adding opportunities to our good full use Also currently oil price is absolutely elevated but still if oil prices are starting to fall let's say back to 60 um US dollar per barrel we still think that companies can continue to operate profitable in this environment Um I think a lot would have to go wrong in the world to get us to 60 bucks I'd be very worried of oil is at 60 dollars. I'd say we're heading to we would be heading towards a pretty hard landing Is that what it takes to to get oil to 60 dollars? Yes I agree here um but that's what I wanted to say so really even if we have a hard landing um then um companies will will still continue to operate profitable in this space I'd say that there's been a lot of focus in the last couple of weeks on what's happening with China it's inability to extract itself from COVID-0 on the reopening play on China when that happens and you have the lights of state street saying it's not going to happen to the second quarter of next year how do you position for the upside there? um so China actually um we are not um full on on the China reopen um trade right now we still stay a bit cautious here so we are still a bit underway in the Chinese space however if we would change uh see a change in things we would start to to add onto the consumer side where we think there's still potential for growth and also reopening to happen okay sounds like we're not there yet but energy is the clear call there from Stephanie'swick senior portfolio manager at fish asset management thank you very much",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1758,2022-11-22 06:23:22
19145," it's not a good thing to be in the middle of the night. But this is a good thing to be in the middle of the night. Okay, sounds like we're not there yet, but energy is the clear call there from Stephanie's week senior portfolio manager at fish asset management. Thank you very much indeed for those insights. Right coming up back to business. Yes Bob Iger, we talked about this yesterday, taking the first steps to reshape Disney. We've got more details now on how he's changing the management structure and his plans for the day with us. This is Brindal. China's appetite for energy is enormous. The country consumes about a quarter of the world's energy supply 35% more than the US annually. Its energy needs more than triple since the year 2000. That consumption has helped to fuel astonishing growth, but it's come at a cost. China is the world's largest greenhouse gas emitter. There is no way to tackle climate change unless China reduces its emissions to net zero. The country's reliance on fossil fuels is also a hindrance to its own growth and the well-being of its citizens. China is not energy secure. It has a massive import bill for things like oil and gas. It has a long-standing pollution problem and it is also prone to outages that severely hamper industry. All this has led the world's biggest polluter to take steps towards a radical transformation. Welcome back to Bloomberg, David, you're behind Tom McKenzie in London with Manuscranny in Dubai. Bob Iger, straight back to business after making his surprise return as CEO of Disney, taking the first steps to reshape the media giant. Junior's now is Rachel Chan, who leads our media team in Asia. Rachel, what are the steps being put in place by Bob? He faces a number of challenges. You outlined these for us very clearly yesterday. What are the changes he's made so far? Right, that's right. He's moved very quickly. One of the first things he did was to remove a business head of streaming right now, which is a close, who was a close Bob Chepack ally, you know, removing those that owe God and kind of returning to his own folks to these roles. And we know that the streaming platform is a massive concern for investors right now. Laws is a 1.5 billion under-inormous pressure related to the ability. And so that's one of the first things that he's done. Another thing that he's done is to promise the company really that he would restore control to the business heads, the creative heads, and business is something that internally people are really unhappy with Bob Chepack with that centralization of power away from the creative heads, which really have a lot of influence in the company. Rachel, I'm always fascinated by people's paychecks. What's he picking up for two years work? So we know that Bob I was going to get a lot of money for two years. And what's pretty significant? Well, that's more than actually what Zumba has calculated that Bob Chepack will get as an exit package, which is probably only around 23 million. But you know what is really interesting about I guess package is that the board has made it clear the contract's only going to be for two years. And they've said that one of the goals is for him to the groomer successor and find that successor by the end of these two years. So they're trying to send a message that we are trying to find a new plan. You know, the obviously the old plan",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1759,2022-11-22 06:27:57
19146, send a message that you know we are trying to find a new plan you know the obviously the old plan went really badly in terms of finding success successful I got and the question remains whether Disney can move into that new chapter with a leader that's not about I got Rachel do we have a sense of whether we saw we saw the stock market reaction to his reappointment yesterday but do we have a sense as to whether or not he can rebuild relations with those activist investors who have been kind of lobbying lobbying for change at the top yeah I mean I think people are happy to seem come back because the city pal has is very well known in the industry as well loved by talent Hollywood those are all the things those are the relationships that Disney wants to repair right now but there is a question whether or not yeah those activist investors are going to be happy it's all like a continues in this role for too long you know we do know that some of them oppose the fact that you're basically going back to somebody old to get this company through these bunch of new challenges a lot of them as well emerged from I got time you know the streaming platform with his idea so you know that's going to be that one challenge that he has to address concerns that Disney doesn't have a plan beyond him well sometimes you just got to go back to study the ship in the first instance Rachel thank you very much Rachel Chang the very latest on Bob I got on what he's going to do Tom it's interesting in the stories that we've written up there are the two major institutional investors in which are activist investors you got Dan Loeb at third point and you've got Nelson Peltz again pushing for change and it's interesting I got of course both businesses on the way up I wonder what he might sell to crystallize some value on the way I think there's a line in here Loeb is pushing for this sell off with the spin off of ESPN yeah and some some nodding at Hulu as well really interesting he was a massive dealmaker as you say in his time really interesting to see whether we unwind some of those assets in this environment right coming up Malaysian politics thrown into disseray after the weekend's election led to a hung parlor we'll look at the economic implications this is Bloomberg after hardly a full year of name image and likeness deals being a reality UCLA quarterback chase Griffin already has more than 20 deals with major brands venture and charitable groups all while balancing graduating undergrad in just two years and fighting for playing time on the field chase Griffin out of the gun we are joined by UCLA quarterback chase Griffin not just UCLA quarterback but name image like this superstar I am psyched for this one this kid could actually be the president of the United States someday when it comes to building generational wealth it's not about the money that you make in college I'm very excited that I made the amount of money that I made last year I am even ten times more excited that I know how to make that money I think that it's hard to put your head around any narrative let's just be honest we've had sort of a shift in are we in some sort of sideflation fears moment before talking about that all day yesterday Bloomberg you're a man is cranny and Dubai Tom McKenzie at London HQ with the stories that set your agenda downshift games momentum the feds Mary daily war,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1760,2022-11-22 06:32:16
19147," If Dave Rekh, you're a Pymenez, Cranian, Dubai, Tom McKenzie, at London HQ with the stories that set your agenda. Downshift Games momentum, the Fed's Mary Daily warns about the lag effects of rate heights. While Loretta Mesta says 75 basis points isn't needed next month. Stocks are mostly higher. FDX fallout, crypto firm, Genesis warns of bankruptcy as it struggles to raise cash. US prosecutors began probing sand bankman-freeze empire months before it collapsed. Plus, keeping the lid on, oil whipsaws of Saudi Arabia denies a report saying OPEC Plus is weighing a production increase at its December meeting. Tom, let's pick it up right on that point because it's the whipsaw that you refer to in the headline, dined by 6% and an immediate rally. Because out, straight out of the traps came, Prince Abdullah's has been someone with a firm denial. We are not in the process of hiking and so the market turned to run. Have your glasses, Tweet last night makes this point. In the statement from the Saudis, this is what you call buying optionality. If there is a need to take further measures by reducing production to balance applying demand, we are always ready to do that. And therein lies the point. This is about the preparedness to do more. What a global brujaha we had over the two million barrel of day cut. Last time we were in Vienna. That was politically awful between the US and Saudi. So, Tom, the Prince is keeping his options and his pardor dry, but they're prepared to pull that trigger again to reduce production. Tom. Yeah, that is fast. You have to ask what, to your point, around the geopolitical brujaha between DC and Riyadh, what that does. If they do go ahead now, potentially, as you say, a nod to a cut, a further cut, what that does to relations between the two powers, which already soured, of course, on the back of that two million barrels a day cut. In terms of the China factors, well, no doubt official to Riyadh are going to be watching very closely what happens with COVID-0. And you have a reminder from State Street saying they don't think China is going to actually open until the second quarter of next year. Well, watching COVID cases continues to surge there. That is part of the mix for investors this morning, as is the commentary from these Fed officials. Across the Asian benchmark, then, you're just seeing very, very modest gains. There's a lack of direction really for these markets. Just up a tenth of a percent. The futures in the US range bound, really, for S&P, E-minis and NASDAQ futures. It was tech that pulled the S&P lower yesterday, just modest the European stocks also ending in the red yesterday. Futures though, here in Europe, pointed to gains of two tenths of 8%. We did hear from Philip Lane suggesting that a move down in the pace of rates from the ECB may be in the offing as well. So some dovish commentary from ECB officials as well building and what we're hearing from the Fed. Let's switch focus over to what's happening more broadly in Asia. In particular, the politics of Malaysia, which have been thrown into disarray after the weekend's election. It resulted in a hung parliament. Recent headlines on the Bloomberg Terminal say, the Malaysia Kingmaker Coalition, Barrison National, will not join rivals racing to form a government and is opted to be part of the opposition, joining us now to discuss this and markets in the region. Is HSBC's Chief Asia Economist and Co-Head of Global Research, Frederick Newman? Before we get on to the Malaysia story and it specifics around the politics there, I just want to get your view on the US dollar and its implications for that part of the world. Are the risks around strong greenback now being put to one side for Asia? For the time being, yes, in fact, you saw some of the currencies across the region kind of rally a little bit in the last couple of weeks or so on the expectations that the Fed is getting closer to a halt here at pause early next year. And of course, that provides relief for regional central banks. Look at the tie-bought, for example. Look at currencies even like the Korean one. All of them starting really on the last few weeks on the firm of footing. And that's really driven by expectations around the Fed and hence everybody's watching the minutes coming out this week. What's it going to mean for FX reserves, Fred? Because that also is an underpinning in part of the narrative of Ryan D'Aja. Well, we've seen central banks not being shy to spend some of the reserves accumulated over the last couple of years and not so much to prevent depreciation but ensuring an orderly depreciation, providing that dollars.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1761,2022-11-22 06:36:33
19148," The reserves accumulated over the last couple of years and not so much to prevent depreciation but ensuring an orderly depreciation, providing that dollars into the local markets to have an orderly unwind. And so that's been actually an operation that's been fairly successful. I know the headlines about the rapid reserve losses, but broadly speaking, most central banks in the region still have ample ammunition here, but it's all about ensuring financial stability, not preventing effects depreciation at all cost. Yeah, very different set of circumstances compared to the Asian financial crisis. If we go to the specifics of Malaysia then, Fred, a hung parliament, your course, have tension between these major parties, question marks about investor sentiment, but this is an economy that's benefited in terms of the boom around energy and electronics. Does that continue to hold up despite these political risks or is there sentiment now changing around foreign investors in their exposure to this country? Now we're actually in a sweet spot in Malaysia for the economy and so markets can potentially shake off some of the political uncertainties until we know really what the outcome of the election is. Remember that this is an economy that continues to attract enormous amounts of foreign direct investment into manufacturing, joining the regional supply chains. Then you just mentioned energy, yes, energy prices have come off a little bit, but still it's a net exporter of commodities in general that's benefiting Malaysia. So the political issues there are really at the moment not really going to derail economic growth or coming year to some issues around tax policy, reducing subsidies, fiscal policy. That's really medium term stuff. Really going into 2023, we should see fairly robust growth coming out of Malaysia all considered. What impact if at all will the reopening in China have? I mean, globally it can have a significant impact. But within that geographic and economic impact, hinterland. Sorry. Well, they're really sort of two issues here. One is that we're seeing a very rapid deceleration and trade, right? You see new export orders coming off very rapidly, electronic sector is struggling. And so having reopening in China would actually help to put a floor under the regional trade cycle. It's very important. For most economies in Asia, China is a larger export market than the U.S. And so that would help to kind of offset some of the weakness coming out of the U.S. That's the positive sign. On the other hand, a reopening China could actually lend support to commodity prices. So it's not quite visible at a moment, but as we get into the middle of next year, China comes back, commodity prices might benefit. And that could actually help to support inflation. And that would make it hard for central banks in Asia to cut rates. So in that sense, it's double-edged soar. But generally speaking, it'd be a stabilizing factor for the region overall. Yeah, that's really interesting. And it's interesting to think that China has done something of a favor to central banks by holding back and not reopening and not leading to a further surge in terms of energy costs that a reopening would lead to this year and what that's done for inflation. Fred, in terms of what's happening in Korea, I know this is a story that our Asia team have focused on, but we've kind of overlooked it to some extent. But there was a blowout in yields there on the back of a concern about a developer around entertainment parks. Is the systemic risk has it been contained in Korea? It has probably contained, but we did see, of course, widening bond spreads in Korea, a bit of a stress and shorter money markets there for a while because of one particular issue. But it's broadly contained. It's a semically not threatening, but it may impact how the central bank thinks about further tightening. Their meeting this week, and of course, that will impact how they're going to think about further tightening. We think probably one more hike, and then they're done. Because we're seeing already the effects of monetary tightening of higher interest rates on corporations, on households. And that is something a central bank needs to take into account when setting policy going forward. Energy is a huge debate around the world, whether it's Russian gas, LNG, or dependence on fossil fuels. When you look at Malaysia, I mean, we're trying to work out with the next $30 bucks, $10 bucks.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1762,2022-11-22 06:40:46
19149," on fossil fuels. When you look at Malaysia, I mean, we're trying to work out with the next 30 bucks, 10 bucks is in oil. If Opac caught, we could sort of roadtask 100 bucks again. If there is a real slowdown in the world, it's down to $60. Just took me through the energy component and the oil risk or two Malaysia. So Malaysia is, of course, an exporter, a producer of oil, but it's also very significant producer and exporter of gas. That's really what drives ultimately the balance of payments going forward. And we have seen, as you know, a bit of decoupling between oil and gas prices because of the issues in Europe, they're spilling over into Asia as well. So to the extent that we see continued, elevated gas prices, that actually remains a positive for Malaysia, even if you see oil drifting a little bit lower. So I would make that distinction. The other thing to consider here is again going back to China. That is that China has taken a lot of oil demand off the table this year, but to the extent that coming back next year, that should actually help to put a floor under energy oil demand across Asia. And in that sense, stabilize even revenues for a place like Malaysia that's still gaining fiscal revenues from oil and a particular gas prices. Yep, let's see if we can retest the $9,900 level on oil as we go to Vienna. Good to have you with us this morning, HSBC's Chief Asia Economist and Head of Global Research. It is Frederick Newman there. Let's get the very latest on the crypto crisis. You've got the digital asset brokerage Genesis. It's struggling to raise cash. This is for the lending business. It warns it may need to file for bankruptcy. The concerns are that Genesis and other crypto outlets such as BlockFi are pretty much unnerving the investor community on the back of some bankman freeds FTX empire imploding that you've got to sell off in Bitcoin. That's paused for the day. The token remains near the lowest level since November 2020. Our executive editor for Asia Markets, Paul Dobson is here. We begin to understand the quantifying of money from Genesis trapped inside FTX. Is this the beginning? Is this one of understanding contagion from FTX? Yeah, I think that's definitely one of those channels. I think that it has, I've put 175 million tied up in FTX, which as we know is inaccessible right now, which makes it harder for it to get its own liquidity. Customer withdrawals have been halted there as well. That starts that chain of events going. It's very much a question of trust across the industry right now. If you can't trust your brokerage, you can't trust your trading partners, you can't trust your trading platform, then it makes it very hard to want to do business in that space. That's why we're seeing liquidity starting to fall out of the market. We're starting to feel that element of trust or mistrust just continuing to build. Yeah, it was fascinating to read the story, the reporting from Bloomberg around Bane Capital, and their due diligence they did on behalf of Tiger Global. Of course, they got that one wrong, didn't they? So in terms of trust, if they can't get it right, who can? Where else in the crypto space is this fallout being felt, Paul? Yeah, well, I think it's just this big intertwined web as our story puts it of context. So all across the crypto industry, there's cross holdings, there's counterparty risk. So the contagion can spread pretty rapidly. If you look, we had an opinion piece I think yesterday by Bill Dudley who used to be one of the Fed governors talking about how it reminds him of 2008 because of that trust and because of the fact that even if there's a calm in the storm, more blowups can happen. And the difference, of course, with the banking sector is that they have a central bank, if you come and stand behind them, whereas the crypto sector by design does not have that back up there. So if it all does start to unravel and go wrong, there's not the same kind of support mechanisms in place to rescue people and to save people's money. And I think the other thing that's really important to remember and recognize for all that it's a wild story, these are real sums of money that real people are losing and there's a lot of pain and upset and discontent out there.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1763,2022-11-22 06:45:11
19150," Put into remember and recognize for all that it's a wild story, you know, these are real sums of money that real people are losing and you know, there's a lot of pain and upset and discontent out there as well. Yeah, indeed. Echoes are 2008. What a warning. Okay, Bloomberg's executive editor for Asia Markets, Paul Dobson. Thank you very much. Indeed. Coming up, Shell plans to evaluate the plan for 25 billion pines worth of investment in the UK as the government expands the windfall tax, the very latest from the CBI conference, risk and reward investing in Britain on Bloomberg. The top names at the Fed are on Bloomberg. I think it will probably be appropriate soon to move to a slower pace of increases, but we have additional work to do. Nobody covers the Fed like Bloomberg. When I started, I had no idea it was going to turn into this, which is a trix new empire. I don't have any investor. All this is all money in. This is me going out in Hustlin, bringing that money back and just building it, building it, building it. I think about a person that was homeless at one point, didn't really have any money coming in. The fact that this person was relentless and just determined to succeed and not let rock bottom define him as an individual. I can take things and put them together and take them apart and make them better and put them back together. I respect the craft, so I don't want to minimize and disrespect the value of each step of the craft. And do by machine what should be done by hand. Welcome to Bloomberg Crypto. Winful taxes and exceptional circumstances, and this is clean and exceptional circumstance that make sense, but they need to be designed in a manner that really has an off switch as well as an on switch. And I think, you know, specific to, for example, the energy profits, the version 2 that is hitting ourselves, I would say, you know, part of the change we have at the moment is it doesn't currently have that off switch. Okay, the Shell CEO here in the UK, that is responding to the British government's expanded Winful Tax Plan, which was announced last week. Shell says it will push for changes to the tax and quote evaluate its plan for as much as 25 billion pounds of UK investments. So we've put a breaking news, Tom, it's gone red. This is NL, the Italian energy company, the title of the press releases preparing the business for the future. So repositioning of the business and its geographies for a sustainable electrification. This is what they're saying. The last six, two cut our debt by 21 billion euros. The guidance for net adjusted income next year, 6.1 to 6.3 again, quite a bit away above the original estimate from the market of 5.86.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1764,2022-11-22 06:49:21
19151," must have income next year. 6.1 to 6.3 again, quite a bit away above the original estimate from the market of 5.86, but a very detailed document on the strategy, the repositioning of the business for geographies to focus on electrification and securing growth. So that is the top line from NL Tom. Yeah, this is big, isn't it? 21 billion euros. Of course, we know that borrowing costs have increased and of course we know that these energy companies are going to have to spend a lot within this transition to transition and pivot more quickly and more significantly to renewables. So we'll continue to watch this story for you as well and get the more details as and when they come through. But as you say, 21 billion euros of assets is what they're looking to sell. NL. So we go from NL now and we heard from the UK head of Shell and that takes us to the politics, of course, because of that windfall tax on energy. UK Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, addressed a meeting of the UK's biggest employers. That was on Monday, doubling down on his brexit-y credentials. Bloomberg's Lizzy Burden joins us from the conference in Birmingham, Lizzy. How are the Prime Minister's comments then received? Given all of the speculation the reporting over the weekend that maybe just maybe they were reconsidering their relationship with Brussels? Well, let's just remember why Rishi Sunak was rebutting the idea of a Swiss style deal so vigorously, Tom. Switzerland accepts the free movement of labour from the EU, it accepts the EU's market regulations and it pays annually into the bloc's budget. So these are all red lines for the Brexit wing of the Conservative Party on which Rishi Sunak is relying to hold his government together. And there are Conservative MPs who are suspicious that the Chancellor Jeremy Hunt is a classic remainder because, of course, he voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. And only last week he told the BBC that unfettered trade with our neighbours is good for growth in the UK. So there are suspicions that there's a split between numbers 10 and 11 downing street on Brexit. Hens the tough talk from Rishi Sunak, but interestingly, you asked the business response. I spoke to the CBI Director General Tony Danki yesterday. He said that the kind of Brexit that business wants is a Boris style Brexit. They just want certainty. They want what's already been agreed to be implemented. He said that closer ties with the EU wouldn't be as silver-bullet to fix the EU's, the UK's labour market issues. And that's perhaps not what you would expect to hear from the boss of Britain's biggest labour group. And we'll be speaking to the president of the CBI by Brian McBride later on today. Yeah, well, certainly an interesting one. Six years on from Brexit. And there's still a deep sense of a lack of clarity. Larry Summers here in Dubai, yes, you're talking about the UK being a patient in hospital. And we will all realise that it might be a little bit more terminal. That was on the platform here in Dubai. Lizzie Greatwork at the CBI. The conference continues in Birmingham. Lizzie will join us through programming throughout the day. Coming up in the show, Tom and I are going to dig into this Saudi Arabia stance as OPEC pluses planned to cap oil, I put and further cuts. They're not inconceivable this statement from Saudi Arabia. I'm live bad. COVID has changed everything. People are changing the way they work and the way they travel. Can you explain what you mean? I think the world is never going back to the way it was before the pandemic. One of the changes I think, David, has been a change in how we work. Many people had a job at an office. They're not going to be required to come back to the office five days a week. And I think that...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1765,2022-11-22 06:54:03
19152," The fifth change is I think, David, it's been a change in how we work. Many people had a job at an office. They're not going to be required to come back to the office five days a week. And I think that I don't think CEOs per se are going to determine these policies. I think workers will, because all of us CEOs, I think, want the best talent. And I think flexibility is going to be the second most important benefit after compensation. All of this, David, has culminated in Airbnb not just being a company about traveling, but now a company about living. So this is whole new category of travel. That's not classic two, three nights in a city. It's not long-term housing. And it's completely emerged because of the pandemic. We're in the early stages of a sustainability revolution that has the magnitude of the industrial revolution coupled with the speed of the digital revolution. Nobody covers climate change like Bloomberg, your global business authority. It's daybreak Europe with me, Manuscrennie, and Dubai, along with Tom McKenzie in London. So your market has steadyed itself, but we have conflicting reports of the possible output increase. And traders continue to weigh the demand picture from China. But of course, a production increase was firmly rebutted by his Royal Highness Prince of Dulles. It's been Salman. Steven Surchinsky, watch the news store, have your blast, tweeted this. And really dug into the statement where the Saudis, they rebut that they're thinking are by adding barrels. But more importantly, they buy themselves optionally. Steven, let's take a look at what his Royal Highness had to say. This is a bite. If there's a need to take further measures by reducing productions to balance supply and demand, we're always ready to intervene. I'd say that that's about giving himself optionality. What do you make of the statement? Good day, sir. Yeah, I mean, I think the statement the market reacted appropriately. You know, you saw the oil prices jump back up after they rebutted the Wall Street Journal report that they were considering a OPEC plus 500,000 barrels a day increase in their meeting in December. They said that they're sticking by their 2 million barrel a day cut through the end of 2023. But that statement does give them a little bit of wiggle room. And that's really been the position of OPEC plus this whole time. Up until the very last minute, they've given themselves enough rope just in case they do have to add barrels to the market, take away barrels to the market. They're never really leaving the door closed on anything. And you've seen them make some pretty surprising decisions over the last few weeks and months this whole year. So anything can happen in December. But I think the real focus, as you mentioned, is what's happening with Chinese demand with their COVID-zero policy? And also what's going to happen with the EU price cap on a Russian supply of oil, which could also cut supply into the market. If Moscow decides they don't want to sell, kept oil. Yes, Stephen, that was part of the journal's reporting, wasn't it? That this would be a fillet from the Saudis and OPEC plus to the Europeans as they look to put that price cap in place in December. But on the China story, the Liza State Street saying it's not going to reopen now to the second quarter of next year. Does that put a further cut firmly on the table for OPEC plus? I mean, it's really unclear to see because yeah, you look at the supply and the market. And the market does seem pretty well-supplied. You know, you have WTI even before this discussion with the Wall Street Journal on whether OPEC plus will increase supply. You've already seen oil prices really come down. Do in part to this week Chinese demand. I think a lot of folks thought that by the end of the year, China would really be opening up. We saw some headlines about them reducing quarantine for folks coming into the country. But despite all of that, you're still seeing hard lockdowns in some places, Beijing, it's still closing museums and some transportation options for folks there. You know, they still have their foot on this virus. And if the demand doesn't come back in the world's biggest importer of crude oil, you do have a problem for the market. And that is something that OPEC plus is going to have to reconcile in December.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1766,2022-11-22 06:58:16

The analysis is always on point with Bloomberg's energy reporter Steven Sturczynski. Thank you, Steven. The other interesting story as well was this deal from for LNG between China and Qatar as well for a long-term contracts, Manus. Yeah. And that flow of LNG just as Europe is, I suppose, full with storage. Where does the next long-term contract go to? We'll keep an eye on that. We'll hand it over to Bloomberg Market Europe up next with Anna and Mark. This is Bloomberg. DPDHL is sending a consistent message with its investments. The company spent 123 million euros to upgrade its logistic centre at the Clone Bon Airport, designing it around key strategic goals. What I love about this building is it actually shows the big mega trends which formed our strategy 2025, which was inaugurated in 2019 when this building opened. So globalisation connecting the world. E-commerce, we have a lot of sortation facilities here for smaller e-commerce shipments. Sustainability, it's a very sustainable building, there's solar panels on the roof and everything, and digitalisation. And, well, you can obviously see that it is quite automated. How did the team pitch this investment to you initially and how hard was it as a sell for them? How quickly did you turn around say yes, this is worth 123 million euros. Of course, you always have to make sure that you have the right capacity for the growth in the network. And at that time, they came and said hey, we will really see a strong growth in e-commerce volumes on top of the regular B2B growth. We need more sorting capacity, we need this building. And of course, they're always debates, does it really have to cost 123 million euros and so on. But fortunately, they convinced us because then with COVID and the volume search, we urgently needed the capacity. Why do the biggest names in business choose Bloomberg? Great question. Great question. Good morning. Welcome to Bloomberg. Mark is here. The cash trade is just less than an hour away. Downshift gains momentum.

19154," Ladies call for a rethink of immigration laws while Prime Minister Rishi Sunak denies seeking a Swiss style relationship with Europe. Lizzie Verden is live at the CBI conference for us later this hour. Welcome to the programme everybody. It's just on 7 o'clock here in London. So an hour away from the start of cash equity trading and this is what the future's picture looks like for Europe right now. Euro stocks 50 features up a tenth of a percent or so, bit of upside-bats on the London market. DAX features pretty flat that not a great deal of movement seen in these features right now. We saw small drops on European markets yesterday, little more than small drops on US markets yesterday. So Europe looking to make gains perhaps on some of its markets. US equity futures look pretty flat to negative down a tenth of a percent on E-minis and now that futures similarly a little bit weaker this morning. Let's have a look at the GMM and where we are, what stories we see there and where we've been through the Asia session. MSC I Asia Pacific actually up by one tenth of a percent. So really not a great deal of movement on Asia markets at this point overnight at least. There's a bit more movement and interest in the FX markets. We'll have a guest to talk FX shortly. But we've got the dollar reversing some of those gains of yesterday. The dollar back to its winning ways in yesterday's session but losing ground today down by one tenth of a percent. And you can see other currencies managing to make some gains as a result of that. Certainly the Chinese Remn inbeat stands out in the second column there as does the Russian Rubel in fact. Let's get to commodities and we see some movement higher in some commodities. We'll talk a lot more about what happened over the last 24 hours. In terms of the oil price we saw some huge volatility in session yesterday on reports and then denial from Saudi Arabia about its production plans. Parm oil actually moving higher up by 3.2 percent in fact in today's session that as a result of increased production and also concerns around strong shipments. So that is something or data sorry around strong shipments. That is something that is moving the markets this morning. That's what we see on the GMM then. Let's get to some data out of the UK. It's the CBI conference. The big focus on the private sector and what business wants from government right now. Lizzie burden will be with us to tell us more about that later on. But we're just getting some data on UK budgetary matters. So the UK budget deficit excluding banking groups. Remember we still have of course a stake in some banks. Excluding the banking groups 13.5 billion pounds in October that looks to be far from what had been anticipated at least the estimates there was something more with a 19 handle 19.1 billion and the previous number was 19.24 billion. So that is what we see on the the public sector finances right now. Let's get Able in both first word news updates. Alice Hackens joins us with that briefing. Alice good morning. Morning Anna. COVID restrictions now weigh on a fifth of China's economy as infections continue to rise and mining Beijing's call for more targeted COVID zero measures. More than 27,000 new cases were reported on Monday near a record with the seven manufacturing hub of Gung Zao, the current epicenter. Many local authorities have been expanding testing and shutting schools and offices despite recent directives to ease measures. Indonesian officials fear the number of people killed by a powerful earthquake may rise as we search the rubble of homes and buildings. Reports suggest at least 162 lives have been lost with hundreds more injured after the magnitude 5.6 quake struck the West Java region of Monday afternoon. Trimmers were felt in nearby cities including the capital Jakarta where office workers fled buildings. Elon Musk has laid off more Twitter workers from the sales side of the business further trimming as staff already diminished by cuts and resignations. Last week the billionaire asked workers to commit to his more hardcore version of the company or leave the business. Almost 5,000 staff have quit, all been fired since Musk's takeover. A group of European football teams have decided against wearing rainbow armbands at the World Cup after threats from FIFA. The sports governing body suggested players could get a yellow card if they wore the one love armbands in support of gay rights. England captain Harry Kane instead wore a FIFA approved armband saying no discrimination.

Thanks very much for the update Alice Alice, Alice, Alice, here in London with the first word news briefing. Coming up on the programme, we'll get the latest on crypto. Genesis is the latest FTX casualty with the crypto firm warning of potential bankruptcy. Plus we'll dive into the FX traders, China, Covid worries have some traders looking back at the dollar. Up next, oil's top-sea-turvy session, simmers after Saudi Arabia dispels rumours of a production hike plan. Could they in fact be carrying on with the cuts? We will get all those conversations shortly. If you have any of your own questions, please send them to us. IV plus TV GO is the function to use. We'll get into a market's conversation next. This is Bloomberg. China's appetite for energy is enormous. China is the world's largest greenhouse gas emitter. China is the world's largest greenhouse gas emitter. There is no way to tackle climate change unless China reduces its emissions to MEN-0. China's climate is also a hindrance to its own growth and the well-being of its citizens. China is not energy secure. It has a massive import bill for things like oil and gas. It has a long-standing pollution problem and it is also prone to outages that severely hamper industry. This has led the world's biggest polluter to take steps towards a radical transformation. Welcome back to Bloomberg Market and set Europe a pretty mixed picture for the futures and industries of exchanges. FH is trading impressive in Europe this weekend and it causes Ethiopia 오늘은 in forced expectations, the central bank will slow their pace of interest rate increases next month, even as they stress the need to keep on tightening. Cleveland's Loretta Master said the Fed can downshift from 75 basis points, while San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly urged officials to be mindful of policy lags. As we work to bring policy to what we call a sufficiently restrictive stance, which really in simple terms means the level required to bring inflation down and restore price stability, we will need to be mindful. Adjusting too little will leave inflation too high, and adjusting too much could lead to an unnecessarily painful downturn. Mary Daly, there joining us now. Christian Keller, barklies head of economics research. Christian, very nice to have you with us this morning. So Mary Daly, there, I mean mentioning the L word, talking about lags, but I mean the world isn't so simple that just because you talk about the lags doesn't mean you're necessarily dovish and certainly other parts of what Mary Daly was saying there, emphasizing the need to continue hiking. Where do you think we've got to in the expectations around how many more hikes there are and where the terminal rate ends up? I think right now, I mean what she said is what...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1769,2022-11-22 07:11:47
19156," We need to continue hiking. Where do you think we've got to in the expectations around how many more hikes there are and where the terminal rate ends up? Yeah, I think right now, I mean, what she said is, part of the Fed says, there are more hawkish speakers like Bullard, but overall, I think, Paul prepared the markets for a slowing of rate hikes. And we had a very optimistic November CPI print. So I think the market is pricing now slowed down to 50 basis points in December. We actually think, though, they would do another 15 and another 25. So we end up at the end of the first quarter with 525 at the upper band. Markets are pricing around 5. And I think there's a risk, you know, that they would have to go further, right? I think this is what some people like Bullard said. And I think that risk remains, but markets seem to be comfortable on 5 right now. OK, so you think the risk there is that they do more, not that they've already done too much and they need to be more mindful of those lags? We are quite concerned that inflation, maybe more stickier than, you know, that one print in November now showed. And we had earlier prints at surprise on the downside than were followed by prints on the upside. So we generally believe that, in particular, as long as their labor market is as strong as it is, you know, that inflation could be quite sticky. OK, what about where this leaves strategy then? When you're thinking about where we get to on the Fed, stocks versus bonds versus cash, where do you, where are you falling in all of those arguments? Yeah, I think it's first and in a long time, you know, that we think actually its bonds that are where you're better placed than equity at the moment. I mean, equity markets right now still seem to be very eager to rally, you know, they think the pivot of the Fed and maybe the slowing of the Fed in December is already enough in a way to come bullish again. We think that it's not taking account the recession that we likely to see. And the Fed seems to actually, they may not say it openly, but they need to slow down the labor market. We do see a recession in the US. And we think that in that kind of combination, you see how much bond markets have adjusted. A year ago, 10-year treasuries were at 1.5, 10-year. We're now at four. Yeah. We think that by now, you know, the fixed income markets have priced the situation better than equities have. And so I think one should be long bonds, rather, and probably a bit more of the short end. So you think recession phase reigns interesting bonds? Yeah. And we think there's, you know, cash is now quite interesting. If you look at the short end of the curve, you can make 4.5% or so. That's an attractive offer. So there's no longer no alternative. Yes. Let me ask you about what's going on with recession expectations, because there's actually quite a wide range of expectations here. In terms of percentage chance of recession, I know Bloomberg economics has their models suggesting a 100% chance of a recession in the United States. Some of the Fed models put that at as low as somewhere in the 20s. You know, it's quite a range of views as to whether we actually get into a recession in the United States. There is a range. I mean, 100%. So certainly you never have. But when you see the, particularly the three months, 10-year yield curve in vert, that stupidly has been a very good sign. And we think we will see a recession, as I said, because the Fed really needs to slow down the labor market. The labor market is too hot. And, you know, right now, we still have unemployment rate of 3.7%. We think by the end of next year, there will be close to five. When you get such an increase in employment, that typically creates a recession. OK, so that's what drives the recession. And how company balance sheets cope with all of that is an interesting one. I was looking at some data that a colleague put together on the Bloomberg, which talks about the ratio, well, interest rate cover, essentially, the ability of US corporates, investment grade, this is, to cover their interest rates, you know, the interest that is due. And if you look at EBIT-DATA interest, it do. It actually looks pretty resilient. Balance sheets looking healthier, dropping down a little bit in terms of that cover, because interest rates have been on the rise. But the pain isn't sticking to these balance sheets, and the balance sheet seemed robust. I suppose that puts US corporates in a good place to head into recession. I think in January, that is true. Even though, you know, I would say, then, the high yield market, you know, there are some corporates that are more highly indebted and maybe not have that healthy of an outlook on the balance sheet. But you're right, on average, yes. But I think the market also has to take into account earnings, you know. And there we are not so sure whether the market is fully incorporated or recession yet in the outlook or maybe of a, you know, mild but still several quarters of negative growth. OK, so when you look forward, carefully with those EBIT-DATA forecasts. OK, Christian, stay with us. Christian Calabarke, he's head of economics research. Dialogue for 20s.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1770,2022-11-22 07:16:03
19157," mild but still several quarters of negative growth. OK, so when you look forward, carefully with those EBITDA forecasts. OK, Christian, stay with us. Christian Keller, Barclay's head of economics research, does stay with us this morning. Let's get on to the conversation around oil, because oil has steadied following conflicting reports of possible OPEC output increases. And the traders continue to weigh the demand picture in China. Let's get to our energy reporter, Stephen Sapciinsky, who has more detail for us. Stephen, walk us through what North happened over the last 24 hours because when I left the office yesterday, we were sort of around the mid 80, I 87, I think. We dropped as low as 82, then bounced straight back up again. Take us through the twists and turns. So yesterday, the Wall Street Journal reported that Saudi Arabian OPEC plus members were considering to add 500,000 barrels a day to the market. That's a reversal of their previous two million barrels a day cut, which was quite a bearish signal and unexpected. Folks thought that OPEC plus would keep the market tight, especially since there was a lot of uncertainties surrounding a lot of factors, be it Russia, China, as well as a recession. Then a few hours later, Saudi Arabia came out, surprised everyone again, and said essentially that the report was incorrect. They're sticking with their two million barrels a day cut that they agreed to previously. They will come back into the market, make adjustments as needed. But this consideration of 500,000 barrels a day plus was not being considered at the moment. So that broad price is back up, and essentially yesterday, prices ended little changed. Today, now everyone's trying to figure out where we will stand, because there are two forces going forward. You have the potential EU price cap, which could cut Russian fuel in the market, because Moscow had said that they will not sell capped oil, which could lower production out of their country. At the same time, you're looking at China, where demand remains weak because of the COVID-19 policy. And then you look at the recession, as you were talking about earlier, you have the United States and other countries potentially going to a recession, which will also weigh on demand. So there are a lot of factors that traders have to weigh going forward, and OPEC Plus will have to do the same in December. Yes, exactly. And so some of the things you just mentioned there, on the demand side, certainly Stephen, focusing on the weakness. So does the weakening demand picture from China? Does it put further cuts on the table for OPEC Plus? So going from reports about the possibility of increases to maybe actually cuts. And if you looked at the Saudi Arabian statements of yesterday, that would seem to suggest that yes, cuts are still the order of things. Yeah, I mean, I think anything is in the cards. It's really hard to predict OPEC Plus this year. They've had some turns and some decisions that surprise the market. But I think we are in a general oversupply situation. You're seeing the price, contango potentially come forward. You're also looking at Chinese demand remaining. We can, doesn't look like the Chinese government is going to open up and really allow for the economy to jump to the situation where you would see a large uptick and oil demand there. And at the same time, it's also the recession. You know, you have the higher chances of a global recession going forward. That's also going to cut back on consumption. All those things together, you do look at a more bearish market. You do look at a more oversupplied market. And that would indicate cuts from OPEC Plus. But it's really unclear at this moment. We're going to have to kind of read the tea leaves over the next few weeks. Stephen, thank you very much. Blinberg's energy reports is Stephen Sapchinsky. Let's get back to our conversation in studio. Christian Keller still with us, Barclays head of economics research. Christian, then thinking about commodities, I noticed that your forecast around oil, say, Brent $98 is your number for 2023. And if you look at the fourth quarter of 2023, you're expecting Brent to average $103. So far from the concerns around demand, perhaps, maybe you have other dynamics in focus when it comes to the oil price. I think it is a very complicated outlook. I think your colleague just nicely put it. We have a lot of uncertainty on supply, how will the world react to potential disruptions to what Europe will do to Russian supply. We have the question of reopening of China. We think in the course of 2023 at some point in China, so it should be coming back. I think that will increase supply. But then you have a third factor and that is in a way, supply being restricted maybe also through the decolonization. We have efforts now to move away.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1771,2022-11-22 07:20:05
19158," will increase supply. But then you have a third factor, and that is in a way, supply being restricted maybe also through the decobinization. We have efforts now to move away, and that has already impact investments. So I think when you take all these three factors, a short term supply demand, but also then some of the more structural supply side issues, our analysts believe we do get to a relatively stable and high oil price, at least from here, over the medium term. And how quickly do you assess China as being likely to come back? Because some people have been wrong-footed over recent weeks. Yes, we've seen this more talk of something a little more like normal, or not quite COVID-zero in China, a bit of a pivot in policy. But then we're heading into a cold patch, and some of our colleagues cautioned us yesterday as to assuming that any pivot happens very, very quickly. So how long does it take China to get back? Probably quite a long time if they want to keep death rates under control. Yes, we've been consistently quite bearish on this. And when I mentioned coming back, we're talking about later in the year. I mean, for now, we don't think before the end of the first quarter or so. And there were the continuously these ideas that maybe there's some pivot in the policy and some kind of a loosening of the zero-covid. But it doesn't seem to be the case in particular, as long as China is not willing to accept higher death rate, higher hospitalization. And they don't really have a very convincing vaccination strategy in place, and the effectiveness of their vaccines is not there. Then even if you kind of change a little bit on tweak on the exact implementation of the policy, you will not get the proper reopening. We did see headlines yesterday that did say that vaccination rates had increased amongst that key elderly group, but so absolutely your points are interesting and well-made. Christian, thank you very much for joining us. Christian Keller, barkly's head of economics research.

19159," Well, flat to positive, shall we say, DAX features suggest someone's performance in Germany, but elsewhere, a little green on the screen. Let's get to the crypto conversation. Crypto firm Genesis is struggling to raise fresh cash for its lending unit, his warning potential investors that it may need to file for bankruptcy if its efforts fail. Anna Herrera, our crypto senior editor, joins us now. Anna, good to have you with us. So what is the significance, then, of this Genesis story? The brokerage saying it's struggling to raise fresh cash may need for the future. It may need for file for bankruptcy. This doesn't sound good. No, it doesn't. So Genesis is one of the biggest brokerages in crypto. They also have a big lending unit that came after the brokerage. So they're kind of everyone's counter-party, which means that if they can't phrase, I think we talked about 1 billion. If they file for bankruptcy, again, we'll probably see the ripple effects of that. They said they had some money locked up with FTX and probably that's one of the sources of their holes. But they also had some effects before in the crisis. They needed to be bailed out once before. So everybody's watching to see what happens. Yeah, they had 175 billion. All of us locked up at FTX in an account there. They then as a result of FTX, collapsing face of liquidity crunch, they had to suspend withdrawals. They have been in talks with Binance. Nothing coming at that? No, we're not sure what's happening of that. Binance obviously has been a big player in this recent crisis. They were in talks before to buy FTX and that fell through. So I guess everybody's watching. Clearly, it would be a bit hard now for people to pull out 1 billion with confidence. There is a crisis of confidence in the sector, so we'll see if they manage to raise. And this has impacts on other businesses, doesn't it? So you go from Genesis to Gemini, which is the business made famous by the Winkleross twins. Winkleross, Vos, twins. Sorry. They were hit by the suspension of withdrawals then. Genesis goes on to hit Gemini. I mean, this is sort of a cascade that we see happening. I mean, in quite slow motion, perhaps. Yes, it doesn't feel like slow motion when you're following closely. But yeah, so Gemini had a lending relationship with them. So they suspended redemptions or withdrawals on that part of the business, only not the exchange. But obviously, it's quite clear that if this continues to happen, we'll slowly see it trickle again and again through various firms. Okay, so we were sort of on watch for all of the ways that this could get from crypto into other parts of the economy, I suppose, Anna. Because we've seen, yes, a lot of contagion within the crypto space. And at some cases, we've seen contagion passing into other assets on the day that FDX collapsed. There was talk of that impacting on the US futures picture, for example. Is there a sense that this infects other assets at this point? I think for now, the contagion is quite limited. It's not systemic at this point. Obviously, there's been talks by central banks that if this were, if stablecoins were to grow, which are, you know, those assets attract the prices of mainstream assets like the dollar, that might become systemic. But I think for now, and I don't want to jinx us, but I think for now, it's quite limited to crypto. It's interesting as well. We need to think about some of our reporting here. And I should say that some of the five top red stories that I saw on the Bloomberg terminal this morning were all about crypto. So there's a lot of interest still in this story, systemic or not. US prosecutors have been probing FDX apparently long before its collapse, also doing the Bank Secrecy Act. Does that surprise those who've been following the sector closely? No, not really. So we know that US authorities have been quite focused on money laundering and terrorism financing. And obviously, crypto, some of the exchanges were offshore, like FDX. And so, you know, we've seen recently that they didn't really track things very well. So there are questions about how their KYC was and all their anti-money laundering practices. So there might not be shocking. Okay. There's something that's found there. So, yeah, the know your customer stuff. Okay, thanks so much. Thanks for bringing us up today. And it ran rejoining us there from Bloomberg's crypto team. Let's just get to some breaking news across the Bloomberg. A redhead line tells me that Societe is general and Alliance Bernstein, forming a joint venture in cash equities. Sockgenn is to take a 51% interest in this joint venture with Alliance Bernstein. Sockgenn has an option to reach 100% in the JV after five years, which is perhaps interesting. Looking for further detail coming on that, this according to a statement, Alliance Bernstein and Sockgenn planning to form a joint venture combining their cash equities and equity research businesses out of interest. So we'll go from equity to FX shortly. Coming up, Cleveland Fed president, Laretta Mester says she's open to slowing the tempo of rate highs. We'll get all of the impacts of that on FX markets.

So the inflation environment has been changing a little bit. Inflation has been very low for 25 years. Now people think inflation is coming back. How are you going to deal with that? I think many of the tools that we've historically used to battle inflation, no longer work in the same ways they used to. I think people oftentimes thought of housing as a way or especially retail and real estate as a way to hedge against inflation. Less and less possible the way we've invested in it. I think commodity similarly have been thought of as a way to hedge against inflation. There are challenges over the long-term equities have been a hedge against inflation. We will continue to do what we have done in the past which is build a diversified portfolio. Where there are many different opportunities that have the possibility of hedging against inflation because different types of inflation have to be hedged in different ways. So if it's a very quick increase of inflation as opposed to a slow rise of inflation, is it temporary? Is it a long and persistent type of inflation? So for us, I never model myself an economist that can predict where inflation is going. And so what I need to do is build a diversified portfolio where there are different options that can fight the different types of inflation and to pay close attention to it. And fundamentally it's done through the equity markets. Welcome back to Bloomberg Market, you're a half an hour until the start of cash equity trading here on your top stories. Downshift gains momentum. The feds Mary Daley warns about the lag effects of rate hikes. While the Retomestor says 75 basis points isn't needed next month. FGX fallout, crypto firm Genesis warns bankruptcy as it struggles to raise cash. US prosecutors began probing San Bankman frees empire months before its collapse. Plus Brexit back in focus, British business leaders call for a rethink of immigration laws. While Prime Minister Rishi Sunak denies seeking a Swiss-style relationship with Europe, Lizzie Burtburden joins us shortly from the CBI conference. Welcome back to the programme everybody. Let's have a look at the futures picture then. Yesterday's trading, well we have a modest movement across European equities, broadly speaking and US markets fell more. Today we look for a little bit of a rebound actually from yesterday's moves. So the first 100 up by 3.10% of 1% in terms of the futures picture. DAX futures actually recovering a little bit this morning. So they're negative but not really by much. US futures are flat to negative this morning. There's a lot to factor in whether it's the feds language, the latest on China, the oil price moves.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1774,2022-11-22 07:33:01
19161," a little bit this morning, so they're negative, but not really by much. US features are flat to negative this morning. There's a lot to factor in whether it's the Feds language, the latest on China, the oil price moves, all of that very much in the mix. Let's get a blue boat business slash Topper corporate stories we're covering this morning. Here's Alice Atkins. Hi Anna, Elon Musk has laid off more Twitter workers from the sales side of the business, further trimming a staff, already diminished by cuts and resignations. Last week, the billionaire asked workers to commit to his more hardcore version of the company, or leave the business. Almost 5,000 staff have quit, or been fired since Musk's takeover. ML is to sell off assets worth 21 billion euros to cut debt. Italy's biggest power company has maintained its adjusted net income target for next year at between 6.1 and 6.3 billion euros. The company had already reduced its guidance for this year, citing the effects of the energy crisis in Europe. Disney will pay Bob Iger about $27 million a year for returning as chief executive officer under a new two-year deal. Iger is to get a million dollar base salary, a similar size bonus, plus stock awards with a yearly target value of 25 million. Shares surged on news of Iger's return to the helm of the world's largest entertainment company. That's your blue boat business, Flash, Anna. Thanks very much for that. Alice Atkins here in London. Let's give out the Fed conversation. Two Fed officials reinforced the expectations the central bank will slow their pace of interest rate increases next month, even as they stress the need to keep tightening. San Francisco Fed president Mary Daly urged officials to be mindful of policy lags while Cleveland's Lures semester said the Fed can downshift from 75 basis points. Today, inflation is an unacceptable high in the US. It's very elevated in many other countries as well. The dollar fell after advancing yesterday, amid appetite for haven assets joining us now with Sonia Martin, DZ bank chief FX strategist. Sonia, so we heard from a master, we heard from Daly, both of them talking about the need to keep hiking, of course, but also acknowledging certainly in the case of Mary Daly, the lags that might be operating here. Where do you think we've got to in the peak dollar conversation? Because, of course, many people watching whether that Fed hawkishness has led us to peak on the rise of the US dollar or not. Yes, definitely. We have seen the dollar lose considerable ground in the last few months. I mean, we had a massive dollar rally throughout most of the year. That sort of came to an end in September, and we've seen the dollar weaker since then, and the Fed has definitely played a major role in this. So we have seen the market becoming a little bit more cautious on its expectations for the Fed, while we are still looking for the Fed to hike rates further into the first quarter of 2023. It's now pretty clear that the pace of rate hikes is going to slow down as confirmed by the comments that we've heard in recent days. We're looking for 50 basis points in December, and then we're moving on to 25 basis points moved after that. And that makes sense, because as you pointed out earlier, the Fed has already hiked rates aggressively throughout the year, and it is now time to come to an end and to take stock of what has already been done, and to give these rate hikes some time to pass through to the economy, because otherwise, obviously, the Fed is going to be able to run the market. And so, you know, we're looking at the Fed's economy, because otherwise, obviously, the Fed is going to risk and even harder landing than we already likely to see. And so, you know, where does that leave us in terms of FX Volatility? So that's what you think the Fed is doing right now. We've seen quite a lot of FX Volatility as the market tries to understand where the Fed is in its hiking cycle. I was interested in some data. So some city data showing that FX traders are long for dollar, but if you look at the latest CFTC data on leverage funds, as well as the global market, the Fed is finding that this sort of positional conflict, this position- we could see positional pain, causing exaggerated moves, I suppose, in FX markets. Yeah, definitely. I mean, that's what we have been seeing all year round. And that's what we'll continue to see into the next year. There's massive market volatility during, by the fact that investors are basically acting without clear guidance. I mean, this scenario that we're currently witnessing of recession and inflation is something that we haven't seen before. 25 years and I've never experienced anything like this. And that basically means that governments and policymakers, monetary policymakers and investors are flying blind. So it's a bit of a guessing game, right? It's just it's uncertain, it's uncharted territory. And that will continue to create a considerable volatility and I think as we move into the coming.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1775,2022-11-22 07:37:48
19162," are flying blind. So it's a bit of a guessing game, right? It's just it's uncertain to unchartered territory and that will continue to create considerable volatility. And I think as we move into the coming year, the discussion is going to start being about how many more rate hikes will be get. So moving away from the current discussion of how much we're going to get to a stage where we're going to be guessing for one meeting to the next, are they going to hike another 25 or are they going to take pause now? So that's going to be the discussion and that's still going to go hand in hand with considerable market volatility as investors are looking for guidance. Talking about uncertainty, a lot of uncertainty around the UK public finances in recent months, of course, Sonja, and that has been something that has weighed on the pound. Interesting to see today that the UK borrowing, a government borrowing grew less than forecast in October and raises, raises the question as to whether the market is being too conservative in its sort of borrowing expectations for this fiscal year. That's the UK debt side of things. What do you think is in the driving seat, though, for the pound right now? Well, we obviously had massive volatility, you know, fall in the events in September and has come down considerably after sale. I'm a bit surprised how, how, how well the currency has been able to recover because while things have settled down a bit in Westminster. Obviously, there remain plenty of us ahead. I mean, you were, you case in heading into a major recession. We have sky high inflation and still I would say somewhat fragile political situation. So I think there's still downside risk ahead and I think that maybe the rally that we have seen this lightly, we're done at this point and. Basically, I think the market is being a bit too optimistic at this point in time. Hmm, you think that there's a severe recession in the UK. I mean, even the government technologies that we are probably in recession right now. We heard that from the chancellor speaking in the House of Commons and the bank of England predicts a fairly long long recession, perhaps over a number of quarters. How bad does it get to you, Sonja? Well, it gets quite bad. I mean, obviously the bank of England was at the forefront of that forecast, which is very unusual. I mean, normally central banks tend not to be that pessimistic on their own economy. And the bank of England was a real exception there coming out with a very aggressive recession forecast early on in the game. So it's going to get bad, but the thing is, let's face it, it's going to be bad everywhere else too. I mean, recession in the UK isn't exactly an outstanding factor. We have a recession in Europe. We have recession in the US. So there are many countries that are going to be facing recessions over the winter and then only very moderate recoveries after that because inflation remains very high. Consumers are suffering from high prices. The consumption will remain subdued. So it's going to be a difficult year, 2020, I think. A difficult 23 and perhaps a difficult 25 for the Eurozone or certainly parts of it, Sonja. And the ECB then, the conversation there seems to be around whether we see a step down from 75 basis points to 50. If the Fed is going to step down, does that mean that the ECB sets down as well? Yes, they're both going to step down, although I don't necessarily think that the fact that the Fed is doing it is the triggering factor for the ECB. In the Eurozone, we have the same problem. We have a recession still very high inflation and the ECB hasn't done anywhere in years much as the Fed obviously. But it's also reaching a stage and I think they've signaled this pretty clearly where they want to slow things down and see what happens. So we're looking for 50 basis points in December and then down to 25 basis points here as well. But of course, in case of the ECB, there's also still the question of quantitative tightening. Will they begin tapering their investments under APP early next year? I think that's very likely to happen. But again, wait and see at some point because they'll have to see how these rate hikes have impacted the economy. And of course, for us in Europe, very close to the situation in Ukraine. We have a major problem with energy. So those things will also make the ECB tread carefully as we head into the coming year. What's your best call at the... what's your top call in the FX universe at this point, Sonya? Where do you see the best opportunity? Maybe that's underappreciated by others in the market? Well, I'm definitely going to say that the only real call that we can make at this point is that we're going to have very high volatility in the market. And that's an opportunity, obviously, as well. In terms of big calls, I think when you're looking at your dollar, there's a lot of speculation now. Focuses are very varied. Some people are looking for further downside. Other people are looking for it. It's considered upside. And I think it's tempting to forecast the quite aggressive your dollar development. Given the risk in the US and given the fact that the Fed is nearing the end of its rate hike cycle. And that's focused we normally would make. But I think in this case, actually, the biggest call is to say that we're not doing that. And we're actually looking for fairly moderate development in the dollar because, well, we see some downside. There are plenty of risk elsewhere too. So I just don't think.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1776,2022-11-22 07:41:46
19163," the biggest call is to say that we're not doing that. We're actually looking for fairly moderate development in the dollar because while we see some downside, there are plenty of risk elsewhere too. So I just don't think we're going to have some major lasting trends going to be year of volatility and sort of zigzag patterns that we're going to see throughout the market. Unfortunately, not a great development for many investors as well. OK, volatility ahead, Sonya. Thank you so much for joining us. Sonya Martin, DZ Bank Chief FX Strategist. Coming up on this program, the UK Prime Minister of Rishi Sunak says the UK won't align with EU laws. We're live at the CBI conference to talk what impact that has on business. Also post-budget reaction from business. This is Blinkback. When I started, I had no idea it was going to turn into this, which is a trix new empire. I don't have any investors. All this is all money in. This is me going out in Hustland, bringing that money back, and just building it, building it, building it. Yeah, I think about a person that was homeless at one point. Didn't really have any money coming in. The fact that this person was relentless and just determined to succeed and not let rock bottom define him as an individual, I can take things and put them together and take them apart and make them better and put them back together. I respect the craft. I don't want to minimize and disrespect the value of each step of the craft and do by machine what should be done by hand. We're in the early stages of a sustainability revolution that has the magnitude of the industrial revolution coupled with the speed of the digital revolution. Nobody covers climate change like Bloomberg, your global business authority. I'm your host, Andy. Under my leadership, the United Kingdom will not pursue any relationship with Europe that relies on alignment with EU laws. I'm not going to be free to do that is an important opportunity of Brexit. And that's my agenda and I'm confident that that agenda is not only right for the country, but can deliver enormous benefit for people up and down the UK in the years to come. That was, of course, the UK Prime Minister Rishi. Sooner speaking, at the CBI conference yesterday, talking once again as we are about Brexit. Now, Bloomberg is at a Lizzie Berth and is in Birmingham at the CBI conference and I know that was a big topic of conversation over the past 48 hours also then Lizzie, as was response to the UK budget. Where do we take the conversation next with UK PLC? Well, that's a conversation. I'm going to continue now with Tom Keith Roach, President of AstraZeneca, UK, who joins me now, Tom, thanks for being with us. We've got a taste of soon economics in that speech yesterday. He focused on innovation. He's thought to want to create Silicon Valley on terms. Do you hear a plan for growth? Do you hear ideas and rhetoric? Well, thanks, Lizzie, and it's great to be here. Look, we think there's a tremendous opportunity for innovation in UK human life sciences. We had a taste of that through what this country was able to achieve through the pandemic. I think everybody now understands.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1777,2022-11-22 07:46:13

19165," COVID has changed everything. People are changing the way they work and the way they travel. Can you explain what you mean? I think the world is never going back to the way it was fully before the pandemic. And one of the changes I think, David, has been in change in how we work. Many people had a job at an office. They're not going to be required to come back to the office five days a week. And I think that I don't think CEOs per se are going to determine these policies. I think workers will because all of us CEOs I think want the best talent. And I think flexibility is going to be the second most important benefit after compensation. All of this David has culminated in the Airbnb not just being a company about traveling, but now a company about living. So this is whole new category of travel that's not classic two, three nights in a city. It's not long-term housing and it's completely emerged because of the pandemic. Welcome back to Bloomberg markets at Europe less than six minutes to go until the start of cash equity trading. Let's get to the stocks in focus with our stocks to watch. Joe Eastern joins us. Equities reporter here at Bloomberg. Joe, good morning to you. Let's start with the banking sector. An interesting joint venture with Sock Gen. That's right. So we're France kicking off in the world cup. We'll start with a bit of French news today. Sock Gen, they're announcing a joint venture with the US firm Alliance Bernstein. This is on the equities business and Sock Gen will have around a 51% stake in the joint venture. The company's kind of looking to increase its investment banking sales at the moment, given some analysts are warning that it could be peaking. And also the retail business is struggling a little bit as they pass on a lot of central bank hikes onto consumers. So a positive one for so. Yeah, I was looking at some of the China news and how that's weighing on Tesla. This is something that's hitting a number of automakers here in Europe too. That's right. So Volkswagen could sell around half a million fewer cars and expected in China in this year. This is according to the German newspaper Handles Black, which has an interview out today. The company is still looking to double its sales output in China in the years ahead. They also follow news last week. They are actually scaling back some of their electric vehicle plans, given some software delays. So this is potentially negative for VW today. And to big news out of the Italian energy business NL around numbers, but also a big asset disposal plan. That's right. So NL could be selling around 21 billion euros worth of assets. Could be a positive one as they look to cut their debt, which is currently at around 71 billion euros for NL. Thank you very much. We'll be back soon with the latest on the stocks to watch the open over. China's appetite for energy is enormous.

19166," is enormous. The country consumes about a quarter of the world's energy supply, 35% more than the US annually. Its energy needs have more than tripled since the year 2000. That consumption has helped to fuel astonishing growth, but it's come at a cost. China is the world's largest greenhouse gas emitter. There is no way to tackle climate change unless China reduces its emissions to an emitter. The country's reliance on fossil fuels is also a hindrance to its own growth and the well-being of its citizens. China is not energy secure, it has a massive import bill for things like oil and gas. It has a longstanding pollution problem and it is also prone to outages that severely hamper industry. All this has led the world's biggest polluter to take steps towards erratic transformation. We will never break, we will never break, build on a foundation strong enough to stay, we will know. Welcome to the European market, open everyone a minute to go to the start of cash, I go into trading in front of the Lackua in London with Tom McKenzie. And these are headlines, downshift gains momentum, the Fed's merry daily warns about the lag of facts of rate hikes. While the Retomester says 75 basis points is not needed next month. FDX fallout, crypto firm Genesis warns bankruptcy as it struggles to raise cash, US prosecutors well they began probing sandbankment free zempire months before it collapsed. Plus, keeping the lid on oil whipsaws as Saudi Arabia denies a report saying OPEC pluses weighing a production increase at its December meeting. All eyes on oil, eyes on the markets, so we are a couple of seconds away from the open and it's very clear that markets Tom are quite mixed, you can see the FTSE 100, gaming some 2 tens of 8% in futures, DAX features actually down, so we look at Fed speakers and of course we look at COVID in China. We do indeed a fifth of that economy now facing COVID restrictions, I would argue there's a bit of lack of momentum given that mix then for these markets you currently seeing just very modest losses on the Spanish Ibex. Now that's turned to gains of 2 tens of 8% over in Spain. Similar picture here in the UK, the FTSE 100, up 3 tens of a percent we continue of course to monitor the language out of the Prime Minister, Rishi Soonak, Lizzie Burden on the ground at the CBI around potential easing of the relationship between Brussels and London and push back there from the right wing of the Conservative Party currently is engaged at 4 tens of a percent. JP Morgan's Klanovich says in terms of this broader market sentiment you're actually going to need to see a cut before risk assets really rally significantly. We'll switch it over and see how things are looking futures stateside then after modest losses yesterday. Yes, the Fed officials coming out saying look we still expect hiking that has to come through an terminal rate above 5% but we could start to moderate and certainly the market's pricing in around 50 basis points for December. Future stateside currently range bound euro dollar just supported upside on the back of softer dollar today. You saw some gains for the US dollar yesterday. Little softer day offer about 2 tens of percent reflected in the single currency currently gaining 2 tens on euro dollar 102. The two year you've seen yields down on the two year across the range actually across the Treasury curve. 4.50 is most pronounced on the front end. 450 on your two year. That inversion though 2.10 still pronounced about 70 basis points. Brent 88 dollars a barrel again there of 1%. France saying said real fascination around what's happening in the oil markets. The reporting from the Wall Street Journal around a potential increase to output than the sound is coming out very strong. You say no not so fast.

19168," the whole market. The reporting from the Wall Street Journal around a potential increase to out, but then the sound is coming out very strongly. Say, no, not so fast. In fact, we're going to give ourselves optionality as to whether or not we even consider a cut. China, absolutely a fact there. Francine. Thomas, this is a picture for the sectors that are on the move the most. So, out of the 23 sectors, I think about half are actually gaining and half are losing. So, again, it goes back to the idea that it's really a mixed bag. If you're a growth stock, you're probably not doing too badly. In today's trading session, utility banks, basic resources are actually some of the biggest gainers you have real estate technology, auto parts and construction on the down. Then the rest is really, you know, some of them coming out with an outlook that's maybe more concerning than others. I know there's a lot of pressure on industrials and this is also because they have to pay for raw material costs that could go higher, including the price of oil time. Yeah, and the turmoil in the crypto markets also is drawing our attention hourly, daily, certainly turmoil within the crypto space. This time, the focus is on the brokerage firm Genesis. It's warning it may need to file for bankruptcy. That is a mid-contagion from the rapid demise of FTX, which is contributed to reduced liquidity in the crypto markets. The saga is spooking investors Bitcoin trading around the lowest level since November 2020, currently at 15,734. Joining us now is Anna Erreira, Bloomberg senior crypto editor. Anna fantastic to get you on to walk us through the developments we've seen just in the last 24 hours. So it's now Genesis where the scrutiny is. Is this company on the brink now? Yeah, so we've heard that they're trying to raise $1 billion. Obviously they were in snarled in FTX. They had 175 million. They set locked up with FTX and they're one of the biggest lenders and also one of the biggest brokerages. And obviously if they go down, if they're not able to raise, that could have very dire consequences for the rest of the market because they're everybody's counterparty. So we'll see essentially the FTX saga, but even what began this summer in spring with Terrell Luna sort of spreading onto the crypto markets. And obviously today we're seeing it. It's affecting prices as well. So Anna, when do we know when the last as it were, like TikTok has fallen? How long does it take for us to work through the second round of facts of some of these potential fall out? It's very hard to say because we're seeing even with FTX, we saw the new CEO say that they weren't really keeping track of things very well. So there's also a sense that some of these first might not even know themselves who they're exposed to. And we feel that we get a sense from the market that everybody's in wait and see mode. People are investing as much as before. Everybody's holding off. And they're seeing if their other counter parties are exposed so it might take a while actually still. Yeah, there's still questions about the due diligence or lack of due diligence. Some reporting from the Bloomberg team around around Bane and their role took to kind of check and stress test some of the investments for Tiger Global. But we are hearing and we are reporting that regulators in the US had started to look at FTX months before the bankruptcy. So maybe the regulators were on to something when maybe possibly the due diligence teams were not. I think they were looking mainly at the AML and K.Y.C. So the anti-money laundering and know your customer practices because obviously that's been a big sore point in crypto for a while. Some of these firms are quite young and quite new and their compliance units aren't as strong and big as those of banks. And so there have been issues with having people on the platforms that weren't supposed to be. So I think that's what the authorities in the US were looking at in the story of your reference. But obviously we've talked about due diligence. One of the biggest questions people have is how did no one notice what was going on at FTX? They raised lots of money for very big and firms and professional investors, even a pension fund. So the big question is why didn't anybody see the numbers didn't add up? And I guess the point is there was so much foam at the height of the market. So fear of missing out and everybody was jumping and maybe they weren't thinking about it too quickly. They just thought if I don't don't invest in it now it will be a missed opportunity. But Anna, what exactly are we looking at? So I know the FTX bankruptcy filing shows a $1.2 billion cash balance. Is this, I mean could we talk about a Ponzi scheme or is this maybe a rival trying to call them out or is it just really lack of regulation? I don't know that we can talk about a Ponzi scheme now. The big question is really what happened. We know what happened in front sort of the, I guess on Twitter what the exchanges between CEOs but we really don't know if there was a hole that they tried to fill by trading or in getting more sure then what kind of work we will show up on now.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1782,2022-11-22 08:08:00
19169," I guess, you know, on Twitter, what the exchanges between CEOs, but we really don't know if there was a hole that they tried to fill by, you know, trading or if, but I think Ponzi scheme might be too strong at the moment. I guess we need to figure out where the money went, right? That's what the creditors probably are really concerned about now. And thank you so much, Anna Erreira, there are Bloomberg, senior crypto editor. Now we're also talking to Patrick Armstrong, chief investment officer at Plerimi, wealth Patrick, we have many, many questions, of course, on equities and what you're seeing in inflation. But what's your take on crypto? It's the lowest it's been for since 2020 and I think it's the highest it's going to be for years to come. You asked about a Ponzi scheme with FTX. I think if you go back a few levels, the whole Bitcoin itself and the genesis of it, you can even characterize that as a Ponzi scheme to some extent. It's the main focus for crypto investors and speculators is the get rich quick. I don't think it solves a fundamental problem. I don't think it's a medium of exchange. So it's not a transactional currency. It has the claim to be a store of value, which is questionable. But the medium of exchange, I think there will be a crypto that fulfills that role that basically displaces Bitcoin at some point. So that's not there right now and the vast overwhelming majority of participants in crypto are speculative investors who are just looking for a quick win. Okay, Patrick Armstrong, there it is, definitive, not buying crypto at this point, despite the valuation drop that we see. Patrick, when we link this to, and this is linked to what's happening with central banks and the Fed and tightening, given what we've been hearing from officials just over the last few days, my question really is, what is most important for the equity markets is it the journey or is it the ultimate destination when it comes to rates? I think the Fed's going to be playing less importance in the direction of equity markets in the coming year. So I think it's probably been the most important driver of equity markets, quantitative tightening, higher interest rates, higher real yields, all of that's coming from the Fed. The direction for equities in 2023 are going to come down from margins. The companies are able to achieve and revenue growth if they're able to achieve that. And I think that's really going to be much more important than the Fed. The Fed's got another 100 basis points and hikes ahead of it, maybe 125, I don't think they'll do that because the economy slows. But after that, it's going to come down to company fundamentals and economics fundamentals rather than the Fed because the Fed's pulled the carpet. 2023, it's going to come down to good companies that are winning and poor companies with poor business models probably being punished by the market. But Patrick, is that just the companies that can deal with inflation versus the ones that can't? So we had a US CPI ticking lower for October, but actually stuff may not be getting much cheaper in Europe anytime soon. I do think inflation is going to be part of it. It's going to come down to companies that can defend their profit margins. So consensus estimates for 2023 are that the S&P 500 delivers a profit margin of 13%, which is a record high. I don't see that happening with a consumer that's going to be strained by higher petrol prices, utility bills, mortgage rates. It's going to be very hard for companies to continue to pass higher prices on to consumers. They've done that very well in 2022 and they've just raised their price and said not our fall, tire input prices. I think it's going to be a little bit harder next year. Gravitating towards companies that have really defendable margins, I think, is going to be the winning strategy in 2022. And I think it's healthcare luxury companies. I think you still want own energy because that's going to be creating margin squeezes elsewhere. And agribusiness equities, I like those as well. What is the case for energy, Patrick, within a recessionary environment? How can you justify getting more exposure to a sector that's already done very well year to date? It's done very well year to date. The spot prices of oil is really sold off now. I'm down towards $80 on WTI, a little bit below yesterday. But the physical market's still very tight. You're seeing inventories drawn down every week on a DOE inventory level. So basically demand, it's not going to grow rapidly in a slowing economy, but it's going to continue to grow and supply growth isn't there. No companies exploring and developing new oil production. So it's going to come down to OPEC, what they do there is swing factor. But basically the whole West, nobody's exploring it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1783,2022-11-22 08:12:07
19170," growth isn't there. No companies exploring and developing new oil production. So it's going to come down to OPEC, what they do there is swing factor. But basically the whole West, nobody is exploring and developing for new oil. So you're going to have demand slowing, but there's been no supply response on high prices. But Patrick, what's the sweet spots actually for when we know that OPEC plus is not targeting a certain price of barrel, but they must at the back of their mind have a range of where they want it to be? I think it's around $80 actually. I don't think they're going to want to increase production if we're below $80. I think anything above $80 they're very comfortable with all oil and gas companies are very profitable at anything above $65 pretty much. And it's every day that oils above $65. It's a windfall for energy companies. So for me, it's not explicit, but it's around $80 is where I think OPEC's got in mind. Patrick, just briefly on fixed income, I'm going to come back to some of your calls after the break, but there's a lot of calls around particularly investment grade US within fixed income. Are you being rewarded for the risk at that point and that level? Do you want to push out into higher yield? Is that looking attractive? I like investment grade fixed income. I like short duration. You're not going to get rich from it. So it's the opposite of a speculator and a crypto investor we talked about, but you can get 6% yields for two year bank debt. All investment grade, triple B plus A minus banks and getting a 6% yield. It's not incredibly high return, but it's a high return with very low risk. So I'm really attracted to the front end investment grade picking up 6%. I think you're going to meet and beat inflation over the next couple of years with that and pick up about 1.5% over the two year treasury. Okay, there you have it. A couple of important calls there from Patrick Armstrong on energy and investment grade of the short end. Patrick Armstrong, CI at Plurimi, wealth, going to stay with us. We'll get more calls on what Patrick is shorting and what he's owning within this environment in the next few minutes. Coming up, Fed officials have broadly maintained their steadfast stance in the fight against inflation. But JP Morgan's clan of it sees more downside risks until the Fed stops hiking from Boulter Bear. We're going to discuss that next. This is Prabfeld.

19171," News breaks 24 hours a day. Bloomberg, your global business authority. This is really a reminder isn't it just how sensitive the markets are to any commentary about trade. We did see suppression in the U.N., we did see suppression in the future. That is now being reversed. As we work to bring policy to what we call a sufficiently restrictive stance, which really in simple terms means the level required to bring inflation down and restore price stability, we will need to be mindful. Adjusting too little will leave inflation too high, and adjusting too much could lead to an unnecessarily painful downturn. The fact that going forward, you think it has a bit less impact on some of the equities. Where do you find the better returns in the equity space? Luxury is the easy one for me right now. It is a sector that has incredible profit margins, very defendable profit margins. High input prices don't matter at all to luxury companies. They are consumers, high end affluent consumers aren't having their purse strings pulled by utility bills and mortgage costs. That is a sector that is slightly expensive. Sorry, but I think it is worth it given the returns on equities and the very defendable profit margins. LVMH, Montclair, Armez, I think those companies are very well positioned. They have a tailwind of the week euro, supporting dollar revenues as well. My concern about luxury Patrick is if France and Lacqua stops buying, there is going to be a hole here in terms of that demand. Forget about China. Have you been holding that? I have a lot of work to do. It is the hypermodel. Patrick, that is the luxury call. You have Montclair down 24% of the year today. LVMH down 4%. But of course you can pair that to what is happening with some of your short positions. H&M next, a D-dast down 50%. Is there still further to go on some of those lower end retailers? Are you holding that short position? I do think, yeah, I am still short both of those stocks. I think mass retail are going to have a lot more difficulty passing on prices to consumers next year. So they have done it reasonably well. Stocks have still been hit this year. Profit margins are going to be squeezed. And you may even see some revenue disappointments next year. If the economies do really start to roll over and start to see higher unemployment, which is obviously going to impact consumer spending. So definitely think it is a great pair trade right now. Going long luxury, short mass retail. Is there anything in real estate? Patrick, I know we are on the cost of housing crisis in many countries, including Sweden, where we haven't really seen anything like that before. Does it also create opportunities? I am short real estate. Higher interest rates basically destroy the asset values. Higher interest rates destroy the valuations of equities, bonds and property. So I do think there is further headwinds for property prices. The cap rates are going up with interest rates. And it is hard to pass on higher interest rates in terms of higher rents in commercial property. If you are renting out office space, work from home has taken a hold. It is not to the same extent. It was last year. But there is more flexible resources. More people working from home. And vacancies, it is hard to fill them right now. So I think it is a pretty toxic environment for commercial property. Patrick, what is the resilience of healthcare, post pandemic? And which healthcare providers, which drug makers are kind of best positioned in this new reality? Yeah, I think in a slowing economy, I am always attracted to healthcare. Very defendable revenues. Profit margins, lots of cash flow. Novel Nordisk is my preferred play. And I think it was the pandemic. COVID was the disease.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1785,2022-11-22 08:20:41
19172," from Pauft, margins, lots of cash flow. Novo Nordisk is my preferred play. And I think it was the pandemic. COVID was the disease that was driving revenue growth in recent years. But I think it's obesity and diabetes, the Western world in particular, the United States. That's the new area of focus and growth in Novo Nordisk has a suite on diabetes and obesity that no other firm matches. So that's my preferred play. I like Losh. It's got a big biotech company as well. As a pharmaceutical, it's got a pretty strong pipeline and it's oncology drugs, I think, are really going to drive strong cash flow growth for them as well. Patrick, did you load up on Disney yesterday? I haven't. I can see why you would. I think it's got incredible assets. I don't own any Disney right now. But I think if you want to buy and hold it for the next decade, I think it would make good sense. I think owning content rather than distributing content is where you're going to make much higher earnings and cash flow. And I think that's where Disney beats everyone else. They've also able to monetize the movies and content they create through three parks and music. The way other companies can't. All right, Patrick, we have a viewer question. You were talking about luxury. The importance of the U.A. and the importance of a strong U.A. in terms of that EU luxury call. I don't think it's that important. The Chinese mass market is suffering more than the high-stand consumer in China. And the high-stand consumer in China, it matters. But it matters at the margin. They all have dollar assets and spending abroad as well as in Hong Kong. But it matters. But I don't think it changes the trajectory of many companies. OK, Patrick Armstrong. Always excellent with the cause. CIO, Apple, Rumi, wealth, on the opportunities around luxury, around healthcare, and on the back of France and East question Disney as well. Maybe something to look at on the back of the renewed position there for the CIO comeback. Right, come up. We are back at the CBI conference in Birmingham. We're going to speak to the president of the UK's biggest business lobby. That's just off to 8.30am UK time. This is good. When I started, I had no idea it was going to turn into this, which is a trix-suit empire. I don't have any investor. All this is all money in. This is me going out in Hustland, bringing that money back and just building it, building it, building it. Yeah, I think about a person that was homeless at one point. I didn't really have any money coming in. The fact that this person was relentless and just determined to succeed and not let rock bottom define him as an individual. I can take things and put them together and take them apart and make them better and put them back together. I respect the craft, so I don't want to minimize and disrespect the value of each step of the craft and do by machine what should be done by hand. We've got the information and insight. A lot of these areas still have very, very good valuations. From businesses most influential and instrumental. It's knocking it out the bolt out. And I was on a great time to be speculative.

Nobody covers climate change like Bloomberg, your global business authority. Welcome back to the open. Every one 23 minutes into the European trading day. Overall, stock is a little bit mixed. Traders, of course, weighing what the Fed does. We have a, I think, about three Fed speakers today to give us any insight into what they're expecting inflation to do. And of course, the future path of interest rate hikes. And then we look at China lockdown. The tax downed two tenths of 8%. Now let's get straight to the Bloomberg business flash. Here's our second. Hi, Alice. Hi, Francine. Sock Jen and Alliance Bernstein have agreed on a partnership that merges large parts of their equities trading businesses. The joint venture will be run out of London under the name Bernstein. And will unite the cash equities and equities research units of the two firms. The French bank will hold 51% of the new business. Elon Musk has laid off more Twitter workers from the sales side of the business. Further trimming is staff already diminished by cuts and resignations. Last week, the billionaire asked workers to commit to his more hardcore version of the company or leave the business. Almost 5,000 staff have quit or been fired since Musk's takeover. Enel is to sell off assets worth 21 billion euros to cut debt. Italy's biggest power company has maintained its adjusted net income target for next year. At the end of the year, the company had already reduced its guidance for this year, citing the effects of the energy crisis in Europe. Enel's debt hit a record of almost 70 billion euros at the end of September. Disney will pay Bob Eiger about $27 million a year for returning as chief executive officer under a new two-year deal. Eiger is to get a million-dollar base salary for the company. In the last few months, the company has been working on the new business. The company has been working on the new business. Enel is to get a million-dollar base salary, a similar-sized bonus plus stock awards, with a yearly target value of 25 million. Shares surged on news of Eiger's return to the helm of the world's largest entertainment company. That's your bloom-of-business flash, Tom Francy. I was, thanks so much, Alessandra Atkins, in London. The movers, it's actually more of a quiet day than yesterday. It's not a lot of pricing action, but there are nonetheless some interesting corporate stories, beyond the pay packet of Bob Iger, 27 million per year, not too bad, is it? NL is an energy company and focus for us, of course, the Italian energy company. This story is about asset disposals about moving and repositioning the business. They want to cut their debt load, so they're looking to sell assets. We're about 21 billion euros. The stock currently gaining close to 2% on the back of that news. Sok Jen, we've just discussed that. Alice Atkins just broke down what's happening there with Ali and Spanstein joining a JV around their equities business. Currently down 1% on the back of that news. Volkswagen downgrading according to reports at least from the Hunderst Black, downgrading their views in terms of sales in China, reducing their 2022 car sales target to 3.3 million cars from 3.85 million. Let's talk down 410s of 8% Francine. Now coming up, said your Arabia denies a report that it's discussing an oil production increase. Well, we'll talk oil, we'll talk prices, demand and supply.

19174," the When the price of anything goes up, the consequences reach far beyond what you'd expect, but perhaps most of all, when it comes to food. In 2010, surging food prices helped spark the Arab Spring. Lives were lost, regimes fell, and the consequences are still with us. Once again, food prices are rising, and fast. GQAS, broken supply chains, and surging demand were just some of the factors that have driven food prices to their first record highs since the Arab Spring. And that's all before a war between two of the world's biggest food producers. Ukraine is called the Bread Basket of Europe, and taken with Russia the two account for about a quarter of global wheat trade. They produce more than half of the world's sunflower seeds in oil, nearly 20% of the barley. Now throw in rising energy prices, and processing, transporting, even refrigerating food gets more expensive. Plus, fertilizer production is extremely energy intensive. Less fertilizer means lower crop yield, and prices rise even more. The pandemic revealed how complicated and fragile global trade systems are. Global agriculture, perhaps even more so. Unlike metals, for example, food goes bad. And crops take months to grow, and are vulnerable to unpredictabilities like the weather. Rising food prices will be felt everywhere, but the poorest countries in the world will be hit the hardest. And as all these factors compound, the real fear is that record high will lead to record high, and ultimately, to a global food crisis with vast consequences. I think that it's hard to put your head around any narrative. Like to be honest, we've had sort of a shift in our wean some sort of circulation fears moment. People were talking about that all day yesterday. Welcome back to the open, everyone. 30 minutes into the European trading den here are your top stories. Downshift to Gaines Momentum, the feds Mary daily warns about the lag effects of rate hikes while the rest says 75 basis points isn't needed next month. Ftx Fallout, crypto from Genesis, warns of bankruptcy as its struggles to raise cash to its prosecutors, began probing Sandbankton freeds empire months before its collapse. Plus, keeping the lid on oil, whipsaws, and Saudi Arabia denies a report saying OPEC plus is weighing a production increase at its December meeting. Tom, if you look at the markets, it's fed China, oil also dominating them all. Yeah, and you see that reflected in the FTSE 100. So I'm the top gainers for the FTSE 100. And it's the fact that the last time I checked the three top gainers are all energy companies on the back of that OPEC plus story. We're going to break that down for you in more detail. And the pushback from that Wall Street Journal reporting that maybe they were looking at an increase. The pushback came pretty swift from the Saudis. Across the bench might you see Gaines of 2.5%. So for the moment, wiping out the losses, the modest losses we saw yesterday, the DAX is range bound there, not a lot of movement on the German index, 14,380. You got Volkswagen there warning, according to reporting from the Huntersbat that maybe their sales in China will be meeting the targets they previously set. We know about a fifth of that economy facing COVID controls at this point. The first of 100, as I mentioned, gaining 7.10% of a percent up 51.7,428 energy, a big factor there. Let's switch it over then see how the sectors are playing out for you this morning. Oil, the last time I checked Brent above WTI, above $80, a barrel, Brent up around 1.5%. And in his energy top of the list, 3.4% tie that into the OPEC plus story. It resources gaining as well, making up for some of the pressure that we saw yesterday on the back of China demand concerns.

19175," on concerns currently up around 2% but that has been a volatile sector in the red and number of sectors real estate at the bottom list now 6 tenths of a percent but it is the oil story that's dominating on the sector by sector basis and certainly propping up the FTSE 100 Francie oil steady pretty much steady following a conflicting report of possible op-ech output increases as traders continue to away the demand picture in China we're joining us now to discuss all this is Bloomberg's Paul Wallace who leads our coverage of Middle Eastern energy and commodities Paul good morning so talk us through some of the twists and turns in the oil market at the moment Hi Francie well yes oil was really whipsword around midday London time yesterday when there was a report from the Wall Street Journal that op-ech was thinking of raising production at next month meeting and possibly by as much as 500,000 barrels a day roughly an hour or two later the Saudis came out with a denial of that story a very unambiguous and strongly worded denial which they don't often do even with stories that they don't like they said that if anything they were they were going to cut production even further if they needed to so oil sort of erased all its losses after that and it's up again today and in some sense some sense as the Saudis have sort of set the scene for the December 4th op-ech plus meeting and it looks at least if yesterday statement from the Saudis was anything to go by that the group will either stay steady without put or reduce it but it seems unlikely you'd have to say that it will end up raising production. Okay Paul Wallace thank you on that op-ech plus story then the Saudis coming out again pushing back against that Wall Street Journal story you're seeing gains for Brent WTI on the back of that let's stay with the energy story and the implications for Central and Eastern Europe and beyond with us discuss the wider economic picture is Kevin daily co-head of C E E M E A we need a pithier acronym economics of Goldman Sachs Kevin good morning thank you for joining us so I do want to start with Central and Eastern Europe I know your jurisdiction spreads beyond that but within Central and Eastern Europe with the component that is Ukraine and the Russian war what is the resilience for those countries and those jurisdictions to this energy shock we see the stockpiles in Germany not part of the mix of course in terms of your region but in terms of Central and Eastern Europe is there a resilience there to these energy shocks. There I've been so far there has been I mean we've been surprised and I think all the four costs have been surprised is here we in the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine we cover for cost pretty dramatically for the C countries but you know through the course of this year the activity has remained relatively robust and so we've been you know in response to the strength of that activity we've actually revised higher our four costs for those economies now that said I think there is you know a little over six months on from the start of the conflict there is signs that the flow down is now underway we think you know given fighter global financial conditions alike effects of that globally and within the region but also the squeezed on household incomes from energy prices we think those two factors combined will contribute to an ongoing flow down and growth so the slow down is now underway it has been resilient today but we think we're slowing it 2023. Kevin who suffers the most for and good morning who suffers the most from higher dollar? In terms of I mean within the sea region it's very I mean from an asset market perspective actually sea is more close more closely linked to the euro so it's less relevant than we do I mean as a house we think dollar strength will be maintained over the next six months so there's two conditions are started so looking for to you know for an end to dollar strength one is you know clear pivot from the bed a second would be a drop in in activity outside of the US for proper global activity you know till at least one of those conditions I meant we think dollar strength will be will be maintained and I'm",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1789,2022-11-22 08:38:03
19176," US for proper and global activity. You know, until at least one of those conditions I met, we think dollar strength will be maintained. And we see little signs of that. So, you know, although, you know, clearly the dollar weakened after a US-DPI data, we view that as an opportunity to put on more dollar loss. Kevin, a terminal rate of 8%. As we stress and hand ring over 5% in the US, a terminal rate of 8% is your view. Within Poland, the Czech Republic and Romania, what does that do to growth in those countries? It is very... We're at a very interesting juncture at the moment, because obviously, you know, I mentioned briefly the US-DPI data that was we could then expect to have led to expectations globally that we may be passed the worst of the inflationary peak. I mean, I think it's important to point out that, you know, across the world, actually, there was a significantly more upside-surprises to inflation in the October data than there was downside that's the price. So, the US was so much of an outlier. And certainly, in this time zone, so across Europe, including the CE economies, inflation continues to surprise to the upside. And what's worrying about that is that it's no longer being driven by energy prices, that they're, you know, now turned over and they're based affected, that's the point. And it is much more broad-based. It does appear consistent with a destabilization, a de-anchory of inflation expectations. And so central banks in our view are going to, you know, their work is not yet done in the CE region. So, we think they will have to type more. We think the need to raise, you know, leave rate higher for longer than the market is currently pricing. And I think that will be damaging for growth next year. And that's one of the reasons why we think that, you know, we think that, you know, although these economies remain resilient to date, they're going to slow quite sharply into 23. Kevin, is Turkey still investible? Actually, it's an interest, Turkey is an interest thing, because, you know, clearly, their monetary policy mixes is entirely unsustainable from a medium to long-term perspective. We together with consensus expect them to cooperate. I mean, just why inflation being 85% of which is based on the cut rates, another 150 basis points, to 9%. So, you know, that is clearly the wrong monetary policy to have. But it's also the interest rate is no longer as relevant as it was. They're leading a quantitatively driven monetary policy. They're benefiting from a significant influx of inflows on errors and emissions. So, underclared inflows into the Turkish economy, which is made, at least in the short term, we think this side of the election sector, more sustainable. So, you know, we need to be very careful where one of us in Turkey, but actually from, you know, the currency perspective, actually we think in the short term, there is some sustainability to the current environment because of these big inflows that they're benefiting from. So, the currency, clearly, it is a very risky prospect. But on the currency side, we think it will do better than the boards over the course of the next six months or so. Okay, Kevin, thank you so much. As always, for joining us, Kevin Daly, they're a co-head of C-E-M-E-A economics at Goldman Sachs. Now, coming up, we're back at the CBI conference in Birmingham.

They're not going to be required to come back to the office five days a week. I don't think CEOs per se are going to determine these policies. I think workers will.

Talking of the UK Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak addressed a meeting of the UK's biggest employers yesterday, doubling down on his brexitier credentials. Bloomberg's Lizzy Burden joining us from the conference with a guest Lizzy. Thank you Tom. I'm here with our host at the CVIs on your conference. It's Brian McBride, president of the CVI. Thank you Brian for having us and for joining me. We're going to hear from the opposition leader, Kirsta Amar today. We're expecting him to tell us that the UK is over-aliant on immigration. He wants to end cheap labour. Why will he succeed when successive Conservative Prime Ministers have failed in that mission? Well, I think we need to start with the data. What we know today is that there's 1.3 million jobs unfilled in the UK. Last quarter, 52,000 more people left the working register. So we've got a problem that's not fixing itself. Aggression is one of the answers to it. It's not the only answer. It's not the perfect answer. Long term reskilling, retraining is part of it as well. But in the short term, we need to bring in people to do the jobs that aren't being filled today. It's not just smart job, it's not just data and data scientists. It's baggage handlers, it's butchers, it's hospitality workers, it's health care workers. We've got a chronic problem today. The government and the opposition need to face up to that. But the businesses that you represent are facing higher costs across the board. How will they be able to pay higher wages? Well, I think what we're missing today with having unfilled jobs is a big hit to your productivity. They're missing it on revenue, they're missing out on profit. So in fact, these will be self-funding. Bringing in people to do the jobs that aren't being done will drive revenue, will drive the economy and they will pay for themselves. Brexit seems to have somewhat derailed this conference or at least overtaken the messaging. Rishi Sunak has said that the UK won't align with the EU's laws. But given the massive challenges facing the UK economy, is it time that he stood up to the hard-line Brexit as in his party?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1791,2022-11-22 08:46:51

More on the world's richest man and his company's next, the impact on that car mount company, Tesla as well, of course, under pressure with its stock. We'll bring you that story. This is Bloomberg. When you think space, you probably think, one space agency that travels under the radar is ESA, which is surprising considering what the European Space Agency has achieved, and how vital it is to the global space industry. We've collaborated with pretty much everybody who is involved in space exploration. The ESA wants to be a leading force in furthering humanity's mission into space. If we want to have a successful human mission to Mars, we are going to have to learn to live and work off-world in a different way. The place where we are going to learn to do that is on the move. Can ESA help humanity take its next giant leap? This is Bloomberg Daybreak with Lake. Welcome to Daybreak Australia. Welcome to the open. We await Fed speakers and you can see that the market is a little bit of divergence. We've mixed stock markets across the world. We look at oil and China as well. China's increasing COVID-0 curves, rather than moving away from them, is adding to the investor worries over Tesla. The electric vehicle makers stock dropped to the lowest since November 2020. That was yesterday. Now, investor anxiety was higher after a sitting year Beijing actually returned to lockdowns, putting both production sales at risk. Tesla also initiated a recall of more than 300,000 cars due to faulty tail lights. Elsewhere for Musk, he has laid off more Twitter workers. Yes, more from the sales side of the business.

19179," In particular, and how the Tesla impact is kind of overflowing, at least raising questions about the attention of Elon Musk. What, let's back up a bit and get us up to speed on what is happening with Twitter in terms of these resignations. Does he have the staff to drive things forward? There's been concern. There was concern on Friday that it may not even live through the weekend. It clearly has. Was that over-exaggerated? Where is the company now? Yeah, I mean, it's a big question, obviously. It was a big weekend for them. They cut 50% of the staff last week. They were more resignations over the weekend and more terminations on Sunday in the sales area. As he tries to balance out the organisation, it's a bit of a black hole right now. What's going on in Twitter, as you say, the service still seems to be functioning. I think when you see such a rapid drop in, particularly engineering stuff, there's bound to be questions about whether you can keep continuing your service. I think it's going to play out in drips really over the few weeks. We might see a few days where there are problems with the platform and that they scramble to get things fixed. But ultimately Elon Musk has to be playing the long game here with the platform given how much money he's spent on it. I think inevitably there's going to be a short-term dip on advertising revenue. We've seen it had lots of clients pull away from the platform as a question whether he can stabilize the platform and rebuild it on a two to three year view, I think. Matt, do we understand what the long-term view is? I mean, there was talk at some point and we had heard also from some of the anchor investors. The idea is to do some kind of alley pay for it. Yeah, I think we're going to see Twitter's platform evolve in a number of different directions. So right now it's 90% funded by advertising revenue. I think Elon Musk has said publicly they want to get about 50% of the revenues coming from subscription type services. So I think there's going to be a big diversification in the way Twitter works. Exactly how that manifests itself as a user in terms of the kind of services you're offered. It's still incredibly unclear. And there was obviously this kind of monthly charge for the blue verification tick, which he's now put on hold again. And there may be a different color for corporations versus individuals. So I think, you know, he's typical Elon Musk style. He's kind of running things on the fly. But he's involving everybody in those decisions he's making. Yeah, it's so granular, it's so grassroots. He was also prolific to eat to himself, but it's just gone over drive. Since he bought the platform, he's interacting with staff that he's fired, he's interacting even with CBS. They pull their advertising, then they suggest that they might come back. In terms of the attention deficit for his board of portfolio of companies, this has to be a concern. Yeah, I think it is. I think actually, even at one of our events last week, although before in Singapore, he was kind of flagging that his kind of time to sort out Twitter was coming to an end and his attention would be going back towards those other companies, SpaceX and Tesla. So I think we'll probably see the balance of what he's doing shift. I think, you know, when you see what's happening in the last couple of weeks, probably, he kind of feels like, well, I've got my kind of plan in place now. I've taken a huge amount of head count, head count cost out of the business. I've set this ship in a new direction. I can now kind of turn my attention back to my other companies. OK, thank you. Matt Bloxson, from Bloomberg, intelligence on the Twitter story for us in the linkages to Tesla, of course, with Elon Musk. That is it for the European market open.

19181," China's appetite for energy is enormous. The country consumes about a quarter of the world's energy supply, 35% more than the US annually. Its energy needs have more than tripled since the year 2000. That consumption has helped to fuel astonishing growth, but it's come at a cost. China is the world's largest greenhouse gas emitter. There is no way to tackle climate change unless China reduces its emissions to net zero. The country's reliance on fossil fuels is also a hindrance to its own growth and the well-being of its citizens. China is not energy secure, it has a massive import bill for things like oil and gas. It has a long-standing pollution problem and it is also prone to outages that severely hamper industry. All this has led the world's biggest polluter to take steps towards a radical transformation.

Dan Schiff, to gain momentum, the Fed's Mary Daily warns about the lag effects of rate hikes while the Retamester says 75 basis points is not needed next month. Ftx Fallout, CryptoFirm, Genesis, ones of bankruptcy, as it struggles to raise cash, who as prosecutors began probing Sam Bankman fleets empire months before it collapsed. Plus keeping the lid on, oil whoopsaws, as Saudi Arabia denies the report saying, OPEC plus is weighing a production increase at its December meeting. Now we have plenty of stories to get our teeth into, but first thing is first let's check on the markets. The markets a little bit, if not seduced, certainly mixed. When you look at European stocks overall, the 600 index is getting some two tenths of 8%. But for example, the FTSE is not doing the same thing as a KEC 40. We'll get them to the European map in a second technology under pressure down 8 tenths of 8%. The picture not only is what happens in China, but many questions as we have about three to four Fed speakers later on that could give us a clue on the path of interest rate hikes. And of course the other story is oil. Bitcoin also will have a full roundup of exactly what's happening with that genesis going bankrupt, 15,700 and three. What does it mean for the viability of cryptocurrencies in general for the future? All right, we talk about mixed stocks. So let's look at the difference for example between the FTSE 100 where you see a seven tenths of 8% gain compared to the DAX, two tenths of 8% higher, but actually it was a lot more mixed just 15, 20 minutes ago where you had some of the indices including the DAX on the downside. Now a bit of a lift, so we're definitely onto today's highs. The FTSE may have been Italy gaining three tenths of 8%. So fresh turmoil in the world of crypto brokerage from genesis. Warning, it may need to file for bankruptcy. That's a mid-contagion from the rapid demise of FTSE, which has contributed to reduced liquidity in crypto markets.

19182," with Bitcoin trading around the lowest level since November 2020. Well joining us now is Anai Raira, Bloomberg's senior crypto editor. And what exactly is going on? And how many more companies could go under because of FTX? We don't really know. And that's what's spooking investors, I guess, is that people didn't really think that this could happen to FTX. So someone told me that if you can't trust FTX, who can you trust, and now we're seeing something happening with Genesis, they're trying to raise and they've warned their potential investors that if they don't raise, they might have to file for bankruptcy. And that's scaring everyone a lot because Genesis, you know, is one of the hallmark crypto companies. They were a large brokerage. They brought in lots of like Wall Street investors into crypto. And so then they became a lender. And so if they go down, you know, they are everybody's counterparty, which means that someone else might collapse. And that's sort of a chain that might never, never end. And I know we're trying to get to the bottom of exactly what happened at FTX. When do we find out? I know there's investigations, regulators are looking into it too. So everybody seems to be looking at it. Regulators in the US, even the company itself, now they have a new CEO. They're trying to figure out what happened exactly. If customer funds were used in sort of illegal ways, how they got into trouble in the first place, if it was like a trading hole. So, you know, it's so much is known, so much has been written about this company, but so much still has to be figured out. And what happens next then in terms of timeline? What are you looking at for the next couple of weeks and the months? Obviously, we're looking at Genesis now, seeing what happens there. And then, you know, we've already seen that from Genesis, there've been a sort of contagion into Gemini, the trading platform owned by the Winkle Boss Twins. They had to stop redemptions on one of their lending products. So, I guess we're going to follow and see sort of everywhere, really. There were also lots of hedge ones that had accounts with FTX, so we're going to follow there and see who some of the biggest creditors might be. There was a list that came out, but it was redacted, so we don't really know who the big creditors are. Anna, thank you so much. Anna Ereira, Bloomberg's Senior Crypto Editor, of course, on the fallout and the story that just keeps on unfolding in unexpected ways. Now, we're also joined by Hannah Smith, Vice President for State Streets, ETF Business. Hannah, thank you so much. Every time you come on, there's like a big new story. So, I was thinking, like, well, Hannah's coming on. What's it today? Do you have any exposure to crypto through any of the ETF funds? No, we are so, well, firstly, a good morning, Franstein. Thanks, Hannah, for the show. We don't have any exposure. I think what we're seeing at the moment is there's still quite a lot of uncertainty within the crypto market. So, I think it's, you know, we have to see how it plays out and what the implications are. So, today you look at markets. Again, a bit of a mixed bag, like we often have, when you have a lot of Fed speakers, and then the focus is on China, and what happens with the oil price. Like, what do you think will be the driving momentum for the markets? I think at the markets, obviously, the central banks have been driving a lot of the volatility that we've seen, and they've been really focused on bringing down inflation. I think what we're expecting is that's going to actually shift soon into more of a growth focus, the slowdown and growth and the implication that that's going to have. And so, we sort of expect that rates are likely to peak in Q1, 2020-23, and then we're actually anticipating cuts typically 25 to 30 weeks after that, so around Q4, 2023, that's our expectation. And so, given all of that, where do you put your money right now? What seems good value? Yeah, I think it's really difficult right now. I think at the moment what we're recommending is to have underweight inequities at the moment. Equities aren't actually really pricing in much of a recession risk. The PEs are still quite toppy, and so we would recommend sort of being underweight in that area, overweight cash given the yields that we've seen there, and obviously, commodities given the inflation environment, it's a similar story to what I discussed last time, but commodities as well. Overweight cash with dollar. Yes, exactly. At some point, the dollar, and there was talk about it reaching peak and slowly coming down. Is this the time for it? Yeah, I think given the weaker CPI number that we saw coming out of the US, it definitely feels like we may have reached the peak, but obviously, one data point doesn't create a trend, and so we still need to see what the subsequent numbers are, and given the volatility that we've seen within the CPI prints. I think it's challenging, but we do definitely think that we are starting to reach that peak right now. Is there a...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1796,2022-11-22 09:08:30
19183," are and given the volatility that we've seen within the CPI prints. I think it's challenging, but we do definitely think that we are starting to reach that peak rate now. Is there any misunderstanding in the markets that they see actually peak inflation? And is there maybe a belief or a longing for the inflation to come down more quickly? And you have Fed speakers, you know, they keep on saying, we'll have to raise interest rates again, maybe not as aggressively. But if we were going to hit that target, it would be quite painful. Yeah, I think there's obviously a huge focus on peak rates. And I think the market is really on tender hooks every time we have a CPI print because it's really dependent on the performance of many asset classes, rates and what the path is going to be from here. As I mentioned, I think that we are coming closer to that point. And I think the time to go pro-risk is probably when the curve, the yield curve starts to flatten. It's still inverted and typically it stays inverted for three to five quarters. So we would expect it would probably flatten around mid next year and that would be when it would be the time to go pro-risk within equities. So the Fed obsession is not abating anytime soon? No, I don't think so. Wherever the Fed goes, the world leads. And so obviously there's a huge focus on the Fed and as there should be, they've been laser focused on bringing down inflation and, you know, that's their job, that's their credibility. And so the market is going to be watching that with a keen eye. What do you buy on the yield curve? I think on the yield curve, the long end of the curve is now looking very attractive. So given where rates are at the moment on the 10 year, I think that's kind of where the spot is, particularly if we're now reaching peak rates. And when it comes to China, so again, we had the surprise, you know, the market was pretty happy that it was opening and maybe we could have a more stable or certainly putting aside the zero-COVID policy. It doesn't seem the case. Yeah, it's interesting. One thing that we say regarding China is what they do, not what they say. And so obviously last week we saw this rhetoric that perhaps there'll be a more soft approach to the zero-COVID policy. And now that seems to have changed, given the death that we saw more recently related to COVID. And so I think China's interesting. It's obviously trading very cheap versus the developed markets. Emerging markets in general are trading, I think, on the debt side at a 95 percent hour. So they've only been cheaper 5 percent of the time. And on the equity side, at a 40 percent discount to a developed market. So there's definitely attractive valuations, but as we know, the emerging markets valuations aren't enough of a catalyst. We have to see that zero-COVID, a change to the zero-COVID policy in order to give investors some reassurance that that's not going to continue to damage the economy. So you're not playing the China market right now? I don't know. Not at the moment. Is there anything else in emerging markets that looks attractive, as you say? It's not all about valuations. It's also the path forward. Yeah, absolutely. I think if investors do want to gain exposure to emerging markets, then Latin, where they're huge commodity exporters, and so they can benefit from the rising commodity prices. So that would be the area within emerging market, which looks more attractive. But obviously, investors have to have the risk appetite for it. Yeah, they certainly do. Hannah, thanks so much. Hannah Smith, their vice president for state streets, ETF business. Stays with us. We'll talk about the UK and that you shortly coming up. Fed officials have broadly maintained their steadfast stance in the fight against inflation, and the European markets' collinevage, though, is more downside risks until the Fed stops hiking.

19184," [♪ music playing<|cs|><|translate|><|vi|><|translate|>às The top names in climate change are on Bloomberg. Building out local wind, local solar, hydrogen, these are solutions to not just climate issues but geopolitical issues. We are in position by 2030 to have 80% of all electricity generated by wind. The renewables are the safest, the cleanest and the cheapest form of energy today, especially for countries such as Greece. Nobody covers climate change like Bloomberg, your global business authority. As we work to bring policy to what we call a sufficiently restrictive stance, which really in simple terms means the level required to bring inflation down and restore price stability, we will need to be mindful. Adjusting to little will leave inflation too hot and adjusting too much could lead to an unnecessarily painful downturn. Well, that was the San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly speaking about the potential impact of Fed policy. Her Cleveland counterpart, Loretta Mester, said she's open to slowing the pace of rate hikes. And then, JP Morgan's clout of it says the Fed will have to start reducing interest rates for there to be sustained rally and risky assets, but that's not likely in the near term. We're back with House Smith Vice President for State Streets ETF business. And we were talking a little bit before about inflation dynamics in the U.S. and the fact that you said rightly so that one CPI number in October does not make a trend. It seems that inflation in Europe would be stickier anyway. Is that a fair assessment? Yeah, definitely. Obviously Europe has the implication of the Russia-Ukraine war. It's more heavily felt. And so the inflation there is definitely going to be slightly more stubborn than what we're seeing in the U.S. Are you buying any, or should clients be exposed to European equities? European equities are actually really interesting because if you look at the valuations, they're currently trading at a 35% discount to the U.S. the average is around 70%. So if you look at that, we believe that there's a significant amount factored in for the Russia-Ukraine war, and so it could pose an attractive entry point. However, there is still a lot of uncertainty related to Europe. So again, it depends on investors and their risk appetite, but it is one to watch. But what's the right entry point? I mean, how do you call it bottom, giving all of the uncertainty? Yeah, and this is the million dollar question. I think, as I mentioned earlier, the peak rates could be within the U.S. could signal an interesting point at which to reassess there. The U.K. there's been so much going on, and I know every time there was a Prime Minister leaving or something happening, is now because of the stabilization to some extent with the fiscal autumn statement, is it a good time to come into the U.K. assets? Yeah, U.K. assets have had a really good run this year, and the reason for that is because they're very defensive in nature in terms of the sector allocation. They also have high exposure to energy consumer staples as well. In addition, the falling pound is beneficial as 80% of companies generate their revenues overseas. So the U.K. is a good defensive play, and it has performed relatively well. What's your world of ETF right now? There's always, I guess, for years so much, you know, copy written about the fact that because of the tax incentives in the U.S. it's just such a big remark it compared to Europe. Are we catching up?

19185," For years so much, you know, copy written about the fact that the because of the tax incentives in the US It's just such a big remark it compared to Europe. Are we catching up? Yeah, Europe's definitely catching up I think what we're seeing within in Europe is that the investors are utilizing ETFs because of their liquidity And particularly during this year where we see so much volatility when the VIX spikes We do tend to see more flows into our ETF range for example after the CPI print the US CPI print We saw 2.7 billion inflows into the ETF the USIT so European domiciled ETF space and so it definitely does respond So is it changing the nature of market? I think that it's providing additional sources of liquidity So for example in the fixed income space trading fixed income ETFs they trade in today They trade on the secondary market and so what we're seeing is when investors want to enter or exit the market quickly Or if they want to make tax call bets then they utilize ETFs to do that because they're able to trade relatively quickly And with these and also the price point is attractive for ETFs as well Alright Hannah, thank you so much as always for going on hand a Smith there Vice President for States treats ETF business Now coming up K.

19186," The economic finance politics. This is Bloomberg surveillance early edition. I'm Francine Lackoy here in London. Let's get straight to the Bloomberg. First word news. Here's Alice Hattikas. Hi, I'm Francine. COVID restrictions now weigh on a fifth of China's economy as infections continue to rise, undermining Beijing's call for more targeted COVID-zero measures. More than 27,000 new cases were reported on Monday near a record with the Southern manufacturing hub of Guangzhou, the current epicenter. Many local authorities have been expanding testing and shutting schools and offices despite recent directors to ease measures. Malaysia's King has summoned political leaders for an audience at the palace later today. Lawmakers from Keyblock, Barassan National earlier informed the monarch that they don't support expremier Muya Dinh Yassin as Malaysia's next leader. The country's politics were thrown into disarray after the weekend snap polls led to a hung parliament. Italy has approved a 35 billion euro budget law for next year, including plans to raise a windfall tax on energy profits. The new budget, the first by George Amelone's right-wing government, will increase the windfall tax rate from 25 to 35 percent. Over 20 billion euros will be allocated to relief for families and businesses facing high energy prices. NASA's new Orion crew capsule has come within 80 miles of the moon. Its path took the spacecraft over the Apollo 11 landing site where astronauts first touched down on the moon in 1969. This is Uncrewed Artemis 1 mission launched from Florida last week. In a first step towards sending people back to the moon. Global news, 20 miles a day, on air and on Bloomberg, quick take, powered by more than 2700 journalists and analysts in other 100 and 20 countries. This is Bloomberg, Francine. How is it going to be? Thank you so much. Now, Elon Musk has laid off more Twitter workers from the sales side of the business, further trimming a headcount, already diminished by cuts and resignations elsewhere for a mask. Well, signs that China is increasing COVID-0 curves rather than moving away from them is adding to a litany of investor worries over Tesla. Joining us for more on Tesla is Bloomberg's global auto-sort, Craig Trudeau. Craig, I mean, what is going on? I think I think obsessed with Elon Musk's tweets, but frankly, I just don't have the time because he's on it all the time and Tesla is not doing great. Yeah, I think the highly online CEO, Giveth and the highly online CEO take it the way, I think absolutely China is a big concern for them. They've had to cut price recently and there was a sort of bearish note to lay down Friday that maybe there's sort of concerns swirling in the market about the need for further price cut. We're seeing it become an even more competitive market with even Mercedes last week doing a big price cut. And I think the sort of amount of tweeting that he's doing is just a very obvious signal to the market that he's extremely distracted and has his hands full with Twitter. Yeah, so if you're a shareholder, you're probably not all that happy with your Tesla stock right now. What do you do about it? You're not and you're asking increasingly for a stock buyback. That's been the sort of buzz on of all places on Twitter. You know, Elon's fans asking for the company to consider a big buyback. This was actually something that came up on the earnings call last month. And Elon addressed it in a highly unconventional way, sort of openly talking about the idea that the board is, you know, deliberating over this, the possibility of a $5 to $10 billion buyback, you know, being something that could be done. But it's he's also more recently referred to the idea that this is up to the board. So he's sort of, you know, deferred to them. So, I mean, what kind of timeline are we talking about if there is a potential buyback? I think, you know, the comment on the earnings call was 2023. I think, of course, that's going to be dependent on just how confident management and the board are about cash flow and sort of the state of the business. And so, you know, maybe this is a way for the board to signal confidence, but also it may be a little bit of, you know, sort of there may be a bearish takeaway from this that the stock, that the cash couldn't be put to use in other ways. So it could...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1800,2022-11-22 09:25:53
19187," COVID has changed everything. People are changing the way they work and the way they travel. Can you explain what you mean? I think the world is never going back to the way it was fully before the pandemic. And one of the changes I think, David, has been a change in how we work. Many people had a job at an office. They're not going to be required to come back to the office five days a week. And I think that I don't think CEOs per se are going to determine these policies. I think workers will because all of us CEOs I think want the best talent. And I think flexibility is going to be the second most important benefit after compensation. All of this David has culminated in the Airbnb not just being a company about traveling, but now a company about living. So this is whole new category of travel that's not classic two, three nights in a city. It's not long-term housing and it's completely emerged because of the pandemic. No one covers the world like Bloomberg. My team thinks 2023. We avoid a recession. I'm a little more skeptical about that. China and the US both do not want to see nuclear force in the European continent. The regulators here in the Bahá'uá is our ongoing with their investigation in to aptiats.

FtxFa, crypto from Genesis, warns of bankruptcy as its struggles to raise cash. US prosecutors began probing some banking for the empire months before its collapse. Plus keeping the lid on. Oil, whipsaws as Sad Ura did. And I see reports saying OPEC plus is weighing a production increase and it's December new. Well, good morning everyone and welcome to Bloomberg surveillance early edition in front of the Lakhwa here in London. Now let's turn to the UK Prime Minister Wishi Sunak addressed a meeting of the country's biggest employers yesterday doubling down on his Brexit to your credentials. Under my leadership the United Kingdom will not pursue any relationship with Europe that relies on alignment with EU laws. Having the regulatory freedom to do that is an important opportunity of Brexit. And that's my agenda and I'm confident that that agenda is not only right for the country but can deliver enormous benefit for people up and down the UK in the years to become. So we'll get back of course to Birmingham and the CBI. Let's now talk to a living legend of the global video game industry. He's in Livingstone. He received a knighthood for his services to the UK's gaming sector earlier this month. Now he co-founded two billion dollar game companies, GamesWorks and Ados, the latter, the company behind Lara Croft Tomb Raider. Now an angel investor Ian is general partner of the gaming VC fund Hero Capital and we're very pleased to welcome him on Bloomberg Surveillance. Early edition. Sir Ian there's so much to talk about. First of all thank you so much for coming in. Look the gaming industry is one of the big booms that we've seen over the last 10-15 years. If you're a gamer you live at you breathe at you don't talk about anything else. Maybe for outside investors it's not something that you spend a whole lot of time on. How does a metaverse change this? Well the game's issue is risen to a state where it's 250 billion dollar industry. Some three billion people play every time it's an advanced in technology offers a new platform for games to be enjoyed. So it's originally PCs and consoles and Facebook became a platform. Smartphones obviously became a huge platform for casual games and then VR, AR, eSports and now we're talking about the metaverse. But it's the games interest that's actually built the metaverse. Games like Fortnite where you don't just play together, you hang out together, you can trans-.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1801,2022-11-22 09:32:59
19188," AR, eSports, and now we're talking about the Metaverse. But it's the game's interest that's actually built the Metaverse. The game's like Fortnite, where you don't just play together, you hang out together, you can transact together, you can go and watch a Travis Scott. Concert together? Yeah. Concert together. So it's a place where the digital world can meet the physical world. So how much bigger do you think the game industry can actually be in the next five, ten years? The numbers were we over optimistic about how big it could get and how quickly, or underestimating it? I think people have always been surprised that no one talks about it, because we don't have celebrity like film or TV or music. There are no kind of video game stars. They're all virtual. And in the UK particularly, we've created some of the biggest franchises in the whole world, but people don't know that. They think they have come from the States or China or Japan. But it's set to grow because it speaks to generations, Z. Because everything they do is interactive, proliferous of social media. They live their lives together with their friends, and guess what? They want their entertainment to be interactive. So of course, game speaks to that. It could give some agency control. So they want to be in control of their entertainment as well as instead of just being a kind of passive receptory of whatever you're fed by a director. I mean, when you started games workshop, I was like, I know you were telling me what it was like, which was tough right for a couple of years. But what did you see in the future that others didn't? Well, we started off in 1975, and we kind of made it because we went along, loads of mistakes, had to live in a van for three months. He goes to a bank manager and say, you've got this great game, it's a role-playing game. And he looks at you rather like a dog watching television, has no understanding whatsoever what you're talking about. But we were passionate about play. I mean, when you're driving this world as babies, you interact with that world. You learn through play. And I think it speaks to us as human beings, that's kind of social aspect. So I could see that the game just was bound to grow once it got enough games of that, it spoke to everybody. But the pace of change is incredible, right in the gaming industry over the last 10 years, because of our devices and VR and things like that. Is that pace of change going to increase even more? And what does it mean for putting capital at work, where companies will become the next big thing? Well, there's been a disconnect between the makers and the money. I don't think games come as always being investor-ready. They don't have to speak to the money. And I don't think the money really understood what good looks like. So I think there's a much, much greater engagement. Because what makes a good game, the investors don't really know about that. But it's about investing in teams, not just the game. When people asked me, what's the three most important things about a game? I was like, game play, game play, game play. Technology and graphics play a critical but supporting role. But it's the team that is so important, those who've actually done it before, got some skin of the game, got some technology, got some intellectual property, and they've failed before. So you leverage all their expertise and likely as not, they're going to be successful one day. So if you're a good investor, you're either a gamer, or you have in your close vicinity someone who can test games for you. Well, you don't have to stand the next big thing. You don't have to be a gamer, you need to have somebody on your team who really understands that. I mean, there are incredible success stories. There's a company in Wilmslow that I've put some seed capital into, called PlayDemic. It's generating $200 million top line revenue per annum, $100 million a bit, and the company ultimately sells to electronic arts for $1.3 billion. There's only 80 people in that company. I don't know of any other industries where 80 people can generate that kind of enterprise value. And so post-COVID, the game's introduced all the right boxes for success. It's intellectual property creating, high salaries, high tech, regional, which speaks to the government's wish. It's an export story because it's access global markets to whatever dishplop. And there's a red tape right to export it because it's on digital platforms. Exactly. So you can connect directives of kind of business to consume the proposition. Is the UK losing its star somewhat? It used to be, or have a lot of developers also from the outside. And I don't know whether it's a cost of living crisis, you know, Brexit, maybe weaker pound, that, what will hurt that? Well, the game's industry in the UK's always been successful as some 2000 studios here. Most of those are micro-studies, but some of the biggest franchises in the world from Grand Theft Auto to Tomb Raider to full guys to golf plash. They've all been created here. The common denominator, sadly, might say, is that they're all foreign owned. So whilst it secures inward investment and job.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1802,2022-11-22 09:37:25
19189," To golf clash of all being created here, the common denominator, sadly, might say is that they're all for unknown. So whilst it's secure, it's inward investment and jobs. A lot of the profits is banked over C. So I'd like to see greater investment in the UK in particular, so they can go further up the value chain of IP ownership. What's your favourite game right now that we haven't heard of? Well, we're getting onto Christmas. That's been laughing lots of my favourite child now. Which we all have one. I mean, I'm old, so I can only play strategy games. I play games like Civilisation. There's a lovely little pixel game called Kinsey coming out soon. The usual hits will always be the new FIFA games will be extraordinary. It's whatever you enjoy playing yourself, because it's where there's single player, multiplayer, and whether you want dexterity or just strategies, it's up to you. There is something for everybody now. As a venture capitalist, how hard is it to have one game that's very popular for a company to come up with one game that does amazingly well, and then to build on those successes? Some of the companies are one game wonder. Yeah, but it's a great one to me. I mean, games like Candy Crush and Clash of Towns, they've been running for 10 years now. It's games and service, and they're optimised over time through analytics and data, so understanding consumer behaviour, improving the monetisation, the retention, and making, giving them more of what they actually enjoy doing inside a game, you can really move it from being the risk profile of the game, which has changed dramatically, because it used to be a premium price product in a physical box, managing the supply chain to get to ultimately to a consumer in a retail store, and if that game wasn't as good as people expected it'd come back in returns. Now, you can address the global market and run it as games and service, optimise it through data, and you can get two, three, four, five, six, seven years of revenue out of that game. What's app, groups of mothers all over the world? The one question is, how do I get my kids off? Some of the gaming, because they want to do it 24 hours a day. Is there an advice? What happens to them? Well, anything you enjoy doing, you want to do it a lot. People would play golf for the seven days a week if you allowed them. You have to manage people's time. It's a responsibility of adults in particular to manage their children's activities. Do you see China coming back? There was a lot of regulation for Chinese to limit the amount of time they spend on screen and gaming. Do you think that it will reverse at some point? Yeah, absolutely. I know several Chinese games companies, but Japanese Tencent particularly because they're quite super-grub, which I was chairman of until January this year. There's definitely a mood now to relax on those constraints. All right, really interesting. Sir Ian Livingstone, thank you so much for joining us today. I hope it's just one interview of many to come. Go founder of Games Workshop and General Partners at Hero Capital. Now, let's get back also to the CBI conference. Bloomberg's Lizzy Burton joins us from Birmingham, Lizzy. Opposition Labour leader, Kirsta Amher's turn to address the meeting today. So what's he expected to say? Yeah, Kirsta Amher is about to speak any moment now, Francine, and he's expected to say that the UK is overreliant on immigration to boost its growth. And therefore, he wants to end this era of low pay and stop the reliance on cheap labour. But of course, we've heard this time and again, in fact, from various conservative prime ministers. So the question really is going to be, how can he do that? Can he convince the room full of business leaders that he's got a plan to make things any different? And in fact, I was speaking to the CBI president Brian McBride earlier. He said that we do need some low skilled labour in the UK, like the baggage handlers. And he also said on the growth question that Labour would face many of the same fiscal constraints that the government has faced. And that means it's going to be even more difficult to balance fighting inflation with driving the economy. But growth is what the CBI wants to see. Lizzy, thanks so much, Lizzy Burton there at the CBI conference in Birmingham. Coming up, it's a circle of life.

19190," Yuumi's China's appetite for energy is enormous. The country consumes about a quarter of the world's energy supply, 35% more than the US annually. Its energy needs have more than tripled since the year 2000. That consumption has helped to fuel astonishing growth but it's come at a cost. China is the world's largest greenhouse gas emitter. There is no way to tackle climate change unless China reduces its emissions to net zero. The country's reliance on fossil fuels is also a hindrance to its own growth and the well-being of its citizens. China is not energy secure, it has a massive import bill for things like oil and gas. It has a long-standing pollution problem and it is also prone to outages that severely hamper industry. All this has led the world's biggest polluter to take steps towards a radical transformation. A lot's happening on Wall Street. I'm quoting Kurt, the centre is holding. Need to catch up? This is Bloomberg Wall Street week, I'm David Weston. We've got the information and insight. A lot of these areas still have very, very good valuations. From businesses most influential and instrumental. It's knocking it out of the bullseye. That's not a great time to be speculative. It's time for a pivot. We're talking about a significant hit to our standard of living. Bloomberg Wall Street week, live Friday with replays all weekend on Bloomberg Television and Radio. Economics, finance, politics, this is Bloomberg's events, really addition and promising life right here in London. It's a whole new world at Disney. Well, Bob Eiger got straight back to business after making his surprise return as chief executive, taking the first steps to reshape the media giant. Now for more on all of this, Alex Webb leads our tech and media coverage for Bloomberg quick take. I dare you to sing all of that. It's a brave new world. No, I don't. No, I don't. It doesn't. It feels like actually he has a plan and he needs to strike heart. What does it tell you about what's been happening in the last couple of months? Well, it hasn't been shining shimmering splendid. It's saying, please. No, so what's happened is that in the early in the pandemic, activist investor came in and said to Disney, you need to cut the dividend, invest that money in content for Disney Plus. Yeah. Netflix was trading at 50 plus, price to forward earnings. Disney was trading at 25 ish in doing so. It became a growth stock essentially and its earnings valuation overtook that of Netflix. Now, since then, we've seen growth stocks punished as interest rates go up. Netflix has come down. Disney has come down with it. At the same time, there's been a huge amount of internal disgruntlement partly because creative decision making has been taken away from TV studio leaders, films you do, all that sort of thing. So what the first step we're seeing now from Eiger is... Giving that back. Giving that back. So that was the mistake. So is this basically him trying to fix the mess of the person that's been charged for two years? There's a different strategy. It seems though he's kind of writing the ship a little bit, but there are two pieces to this, because as I alluded to, the kind of investor element, they've lost a little bit of confidence in the company at the same time, internal morale also been suffering. So what we've seen now, he's lettered to a memo to employees which went out yesterday, Bloomberg's obviously got it. It's fixing the second piece. It's fixing the internal morale. What then happens on the investor side, we're yet to see, Disney had completely scrapped the dividend. It's been reintroduced. 20 cents, push out the money.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1804,2022-11-22 09:46:07
19191," In turn, we're all, what then happens on the investor side we're yet to see. Disney had completely scrapped the dividend. It's been reintroduced. It's about 20 cents per share at the moment. Previous, pretty deprived of the new strategy where they pivoted towards Disney plus. It was close to 90 cents. The question is now whether Iga continues to invest in Disney plus and just sells the story better or it reinstates a higher dividend. But is there a problem going forward? And Bob Iga and we saw the share price up 10% yesterday. Now so intrinsically, the name of Disney is that. It's going to be difficult going forward to recruit anyone else. Not necessarily. I think that Disney is still the biggest studio in Hollywood. It has Fox, all those Fox assets as well. It's got these vastly successful franchises. The difficulty they have is that the old cable model, which is really what printed money for the ABC ESPN, were the hugely profitable parts of their business. One of the reasons those things are so profitable is because the way the cable works, you would have 18 to 2-month two-year contracts that would money would flow through the cable operators to Disney. Now with the direct customer streaming service, from month to month, the customers can turn out. They can say, actually, I don't want Disney plus. That means you've got to invest really heavily in content to keep the bait going, to reel them in and ensure they're continuing to pay for it. How's with Bob Igerback? Does it put much more pressure on rivals? Potentially. Ultimately, there's a huge bon fight for the best IP, the best intellectual property in terms of scripts, directors, talent. Disney is the big beast in the middle of that. It's maybe had a slightly rough few months, but ultimately, Chaffock wasn't in the job that long. If you think about the cycles, how long it takes to make a movie, there could well still be films that are yet to be released. There were ultimately greenlets still by Iger a few years ago. So, you know, he's not really been there long enough to cause substantial damage. Brilliant. Alex, thanks so much.

Hi, Francine. Sokchen and Alliance Bernstein have agreed on a partnership that merges large parts of their equities trading businesses. The joint venture will be run out of London under the Bernstein name. And will unite the cash equities and equities research units of the two firms. The French bank will hold 51% of the new business. Elon Musk has laid off more Twitter workers from the sales side of the business further trimming a staff already diminished by cuts and resignations. Last week, the billionaire asked workers to commit to his more hardcore version of the company or leave the business. Almost 5,000 staff have quit, or been fired since Musk's takeover. Enel is to sell off assets worth 21 billion euros to cut debt. Italy's biggest power company has maintained its suggested net income target for next year between 6.1 and 6.3 billion euros. The company had already reduced its guidance for this year citing the effects of the energy crisis in Europe. Enel's debt hit a record of almost 70 billion euros at the end of September.

Economics, finance, politics, this is Bloomberg surveillance, early edition and from C-MAC, right here in London. The first full day of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, Iran versus England, the Netherlands, again Senegal and the US play Wales. So the tournament in full swing but not without more controversy. Well Bloomberg, Simon Foxman, joins us from Doha, and Al Smon. The England Iran match was a key focus yesterday. How did that play out? Well there weren't signals of support for LGBTQ after those arm bands were bands. Rainbow color arm bands were bands, but we did get a surprising show of support from the Iranian team for demonstrations back home. The team did not sing the national anthem. Perhaps we should have known this because the captain on a Sunday night press conference mentioned how he wanted the team to be a force for good, but many of us surprised watching this to see so stark a statement from a team that's so typically been associated with the regime. And in the sense, we got a measure of how much of the protests are impacting the spectators as well. Many came out with Persian flags. Some of those Persian flags were confiscated, it sounds like others were singing the Persian anthem, not the Iranian anthem. And then others had banners reading women life freedom, the slogan that has been so closely associated with those protests just across the pond and just across the Persian Gulf over in Iran. So, someone yesterday we saw seven European teams tell us they wouldn't wear rainbow colored arm bands, which is exactly what you were just talking about and walked us through some of the reasons for that. Overall, is the sense that the tournament in Qatar will just crop up with controversies every day or are you expecting things to settle down a bit? Yeah, on this issue particularly shows of support for LGBTQ rights. I think this is one we may start seeing again and again. So we talked about that arm band story, how FIFA essentially threatened sporting sanctions for players who wore these arm bands. And then we heard about the situation of several fans who were turned away from the, particularly the USA Wales game for wearing rainbow colored hats.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1806,2022-11-22 09:54:45
19193," And then we heard about the situation of several fans who were turned away from the, particularly the USA Wales game for wearing rainbow colored hats, a shirt with a rainbow on it. It doesn't seem, right, you know, organizers have said these displays should be allowed within the stadium, but what we're clearly seeing from security is that that is not necessarily being enforced. I've also heard perhaps of some scuffles on the ground, essentially, around this issue. I think this is the issue that's going to crop up as more people pour into Doha as it gets busier here. So, thank you so much, Simon Foxman there in Doha with the very latest. Now Bloomberg Surveillance Early Edition continues in the next hour with Matt Miller and Kaye Lines in New York and Edwards in London. Now the picture for the markets is an interesting one. So let's see if we can get the boards up. Again, quite a lot of Fed speakers over the next couple of hours. Now because of this, we started the day with mixed bag in terms of stocks. Now, if you look at what the momentum is for a lot of stocks, they're gaining. All majors are also rallying. The European stocks 600 overall gaining 9, 10 to 8 percent shall be P amongst the biggest drivers. I'm also looking at, for example, US pre-market trading, zoom video, falling though after reporting slower sales and trimming its full-year revenue forecast. The dollar weakening against all major currencies, Treasury yields declining. The other thing in focus is, of course, these Fed officials broadly maintaining their steadfast stance to fight against inflation. But we heard from the Red Amester and Mary daily. So the San Francisco Fed President, Mary Daily, saying that officials need to be mindful of the lags and the transmission of policy changes. Her Cleveland counterpart, the Red Amester, saying she's open to slowing the tempo of rate hikes. Let's also have a look at some of the groups that are on the move the most. Now, it's very clear that oil coming up Trumps when it comes to some of the biggest gainers that are on the move. Gold also rising on the week old dollar. Of course, cryptocurrency, cryptocurrency. I mean, where do we start? Cryptocurrency our biggest story of the day. Prices there, a little bit mixed investors bracing for more ruckians as further digital asset sector bankruptcies could be looming following the demise of FTX. Energy coming up, Trump, but basic resources, travel and leisure, gave between 3.8 and 1.4%. And I only see consumer goods slightly on the downside. So it does seem like there's momentum picking up for a lot of these stocks in Europe. We'll have a full roundup, not only of the Fed speakers, but also on markets throughout the day.

19194," The biggest differentiator of a successful entity versus the non-sensitivity. So you've got to do everything possible to hire, train, retain, put your arms around talent. I mean, you really got to focus on your talent. In the past, it's always been given money. I, you know, show them that they have upward mobility and can make even more money. And that's the only reason people come to world. I think post-pandemic, we're seeing more and more people say, I have to worry about me as a person, I have to worry about my family. I want to worry about my well-being, my mental health. So we've got to start encompassing people as holistic humans as opposed to the tool of the train, which means that we have to engage with their head, heart, and hands. Not just head and hands, the heart has to be engaged. So we have to be sure more empathy, show that we care that their citizens, the community, their members of the family, and all of those have to come into consideration as we help an executive or an employee, be an employee and be a plus to the community and the family.

Crypto going down will be sub-10,000 on Bitcoin. I think that actually potentially happens even this year. It's the lowest it's been for since 2020 and I think it's the highest it's going to be for years to come to vast overwhelming majority of participants in crypto are speculative investors who are just looking for a quick win. We've seen a failure of the financial services industry around crypto. And that looks like a liquidity crisis and a liquidation cascade. It's extremely damaging but it is not reflective of the underlying economy that's being built in crypto. This is Bloomberg surveillance early edition with Anna Edwards, Matt Miller and Kaley Lines. It's 10am in London, 5am in New York and 6pm in Hong Kong are top stories today. More fallout from the collapse of FTX, digital assets brokerage genesis is warning that it may need to file for bankruptcy if it can't raise new capital. Societies general and Alliance Bernstein are teaming up in a new partnership. The two will merge large parts of their equity's trading businesses. And Bob Eiger takes his step, put her first steps toward reshaping Disney. Eiger wants his deputies to rethink the corporate structure and he announces that a top manager is leaving. Welcome to Bloomberg's surveillance early edition. I'm Anna Edwards in London with Matt Miller and Kaley Lines in New York and Kaley from a European market perspective. The focus very much on oil prices and oil stocks crypto soon the headlines. But the macro backdrop is still very topical. Yeah and on the subject of that macro backdrop Anna, we are just getting some breaking headlines out of the OECD publishing their new growth forecast for 2023. They expect growth to slow to 2.2% next year that's down from 3.1% forecasted for 2022. And of the big G7 economies they expect the UK growth forecast will be the weakest over the next two years. The chief economist at the OECD saying that it fighting inflation still must be the top priority even as we are faced with slowing growth and goes on to say that further monetary policy tightening is quote essential. So again 2.2% growth forecasted for next year from the OECD and of course the growth picture in China in particular is what Asian markets continue to focus on as was the case overnight where it really was a mixed session for.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1808,2022-11-22 10:03:19
19195," next year from the OECD and of course the growth picture in China in particular is what Asian markets continue to focus on as was the case overnight where it really was a mixed session for equity markets. You had markets like Japan higher which lifted the MSCI Asia Pacific index higher by about 4 tens of a percent overall but still seeing the weakness in Hong Kong and Chinese tech stocks listed there, especially the Hong saying tech index down about 3 percent overnight. Interesting to see though that the yuan is still strengthening against the US dollar today although pretty much everything is stronger against the US dollar on this Tuesday morning the yuan stronger by a little more than half of 1% to just shy of the 714 level to the dollar in the Japanese yen strengthening as well trading at 141 28. All right I'm taking a look at S&P futures that are climbing by a bit right now just up about a quarter of a percent a lot of green on this screen but don't be fooled because on the second row here we have a color that should be red actually basis points 3.5 basis point drop on the 10 year yield down to 379 32 of course that's green because bond traders want to know if their price is going up or down but this is showing the yield with a down arrow. Now I'm X crude right now half a percent we're seeing Brent rise about half percent as well not huge moves in the energy secret sector if you look at it from a zero basis but if you look at the big swings that we've seen it makes a huge difference which is why Anna I'm sure you're focused on energy being a huge gainer in the European market interestingly enough if you look at the stocks 600 tech stocks are down so that doesn't fair well for US futures even though we have US cash rate even though we have a gain in futures Bitcoin right now is up about a third of 1% percent. But still at 15,681 so this is the lowest level as you heard Patrick Armstrong saying sort of gloating about at the top that we've seen since 2020 but it's crazy because to me it feels like we should be at a decade low right. We're only at the lowest level that we've been in two years on Bitcoin so even though we're down under 16,000 it just doesn't feel that bad to me Anna what do you see in terms of Europe. Yeah let's have a look at the European picture and as you rightly point out Matt a lot of focus on energy names the bright green of Spain down here the UK also not doing too bad and both of those have some weighting towards energy stocks in particular energy names on the rise because of course we saw that wild swing that Matt was talking about there in oil prices yesterday around the time that European equity markets were closing up and so Europe has some catching up to do perhaps on that but also European equity markets were more lacklustrum this since we've seen US futures pick up a little bit that has allowed risk appetite to increase here in Europe as well. Let's have a look at where we are on energy stocks then up by 3.7% on those energy names as we've seen the oil price and this is Brent here 8773 we dropped as low as 82 in session yesterday on those reports around whether Saudi Arabia was going to increase production Saudi Arabia came out and denied that said no we're not planning that an OPEC plus is of course biased towards cutting that has been the most recent action and we have a meeting from them shortly so that is going to be the focus of things so that taking the oil price back up to where we start. Essentially back up to 87 dollars a barrel but the volatility was intense in the meantime so city general we mentioned this is the in the headlines the French bank the stock not on the move very much but a really interesting story which will get more details on in a moment this is so that it's a lot of time in a joint venture for its equities part of the business with the lines Bernstein and it is to do with cash equities is also to do with equities research going to be a business based in London interestingly and NL is up by 1.7% this morning the energy major over in Italy they have been facing they've been on a deal spree they've been buying up renewable energy assets they now have a big debt pile and they're going to have to sell off some of those assets so reducing their exposure in South America and also in Eastern Europe that. All right we're going to talk about a couple of stories right now but I want to get first to the crypto story the brokerage firm Genesis warning it may need to file for bankruptcy unless it can raise a heck of a lot of money 1 billion dollars Emily Nicole reporter Bloomberg crypto reporter joins us now for details so what's the latest we're hearing about Genesis and the continued fallout from FTX. Well it's as you said it Matt the warning investors now that if they don't secure the 1 billion loan that thereafter that they may have to file for bankruptcy which would make it just the latest in the names that we've seen so far this year FTX Celsius Voyager but they're obviously still hoping that that's not the case folks people told us that that really is a last resort at present you know there's still talking to.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1809,2022-11-22 10:07:38
19196," But they're obviously still hoping that that's not the case. Folks, people told us that that really is a last resort. At present, you know, they're still talking to potential of us is about that one billion dollar loan. We reported that Binance was potentially involved in the talks at some point, but as folks with Binance are kind of common any further on that. Okay, so there were these court all talks with Binance. Perhaps good to see you Emily. We're now hearing the FTX back to where this start story was going to so started. Didn't really start with FTX, but certainly a big recent participants. We're hearing that FTX has 1.24 billion dollars in cash across all its entities. Does that improve the situation? How does that sit in relation to expectations? It's a slight confidence boost for creditors, I bet, because I mean on Saturday they had five things for FTX that said they only had about 560 million in cash. So that's only a matter of days and they've managed to double the amount. But it definitely shows that it's really proving to be a headache for those trying to manage the bankruptcy process for FTX. There are more than 130 entities that the group owns. They're a disparate bank account, some that they've been able to identify and verify, some that they've been able to identify but not verify the cash inside them and more bank accounts that they're short out there, but they don't even know of or where they are. And so it does seem like this will be a pretty drawn out process to see whether or not FTX does have enough money to be able to repay the creditors there on its lists. All right, Bloomberg's Emily Nicole, thank you so much. And on the subject of FTX, not even celebrities are immune to the fallout from its collapse. Sports stars, including Tom Brady, of course, the football and Steph Curry, the basketball star, are among the big names. A Texas regulator is investigating over potential securities law violations tied to their promotions of FTX. The State Security's board says it's looking at payments they received to endorse FTX US along with what disclosures were made and how accessible they were to retail investors. Are you gloating? Well, for the record, Tom Brady, I am not his biggest fan. So that is why Matt asked that question. And we can continue this conversation, Matt, and talk more about the broader fallout from FTX later today on Bloomberg Crypto with Matt and myself. 1 p.m. New York Times, 6 p.m. in London. We'll be speaking with chain analysis, co-founder Jonathan Lewin and circle CEO Jeremy Allair Anna. Okay, so that's the story around crypto. So, Sok Jen and Alliance Bernstein, as I mentioned earlier, are merging large parts of their equity trading businesses. Bloomberg banking reporter, Stephen Arons, has been covering this story for a Steve very good to have your thoughts on the program. So what exactly is happening then by the putting together of these two equity parts of the business? An acquisition. Yeah, well, it's a JV first of all, but Sok Jen will have the majority stake. It will own 51% if the deal actually happens. And they expected to close before the end of next year. They will help 50, 51% sorry, but they have an option of buying the entire thing within five years. So they will actually have the option of becoming a really big player in equities or boosting the already sizable business. Clearly seeking growth here, especially after BNP, you know, the big sort of arch nemesis, if you will, in a vested banking in France for them, has already grown extensively buying stuff. And so, you know, I think they're trying to keep up with the competition. I am of the school, Stephen, that the word merger is a PR spin term. There is no such thing. This is an acquisition, which is why Sok Jen comes away with 51%. What does it mean though for the competition? Yeah, okay. I mean, I give that to you actually. On the competition, BNP, as I said, you know, they've been buying. I was your main member. They bought the Prime brokerage business from Deutsche Bank a couple years ago. And they also sort of took on clients from Kredi's Swiss, when they pulled out of Prime brokerage not too long ago in the wake of all the scandals they had. So they've been growing in quite substantially. It's been quite successfully successful for them, how they've been expanding an equity business. Many European business sort of investments are pulling back. And BNP has become bigger and now it seems like the new, the incoming CEO, the Ed Sok Jen, his name is Slavin McCrope, he's the current investment banking head. It seems he's got big plans to expand now business for the bank to make sure it doesn't fall behind. All right, Stephen, great story. Thanks so much for joining us. Stephen Aaron's runs our bank coverage out of Frankfurt. Now, let's get to the media story. Disney's returning CEO Bob Eiger, taking his first steps toward reorganizing the entertainment giant. Eiger has asked his top deputies to rethink the corporate structure to their benefit.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1810,2022-11-22 10:12:03
19197," Iger has asked his top deputies to rethink the corporate structure to their benefit. Guggenheim's Michael Morris spoke with Bloomberg yesterday on his outlook for Disney under the new old leadership. I think that this company needs to really refocus itself on its Disney branded content more than anything else, and right-size it's spending to maximize that value as opposed to just sort of growing a subscriber base without necessarily the type of profit objectives that I think a great company like this could achieve. Alex Webb, a Bloomberg Quicktake joins us with the latest on Iger's plans. So what do we know so far? It's only been one day, right? Yeah, we've seen a memo that he has sent to the employees in which he outlines plans for a reorganization which ultimately seems to be taking it back to the old structure. There had been a push by Bob Chapeck to take a little bit of decision-making power away from the TV and studio heads. There was a certain amount of disgruntlement about that, the creative abilities or creative oversight they had was diminished. That was seem to have been poor from a while. So he's trying to fix the internal problems, the communication with the markets, and therefore the share price that has to come at some stage as well, whether he will increase the dividend and perhaps decrease the spending on Disney plus as we just said, the Google iPod has team saying that remains to be seen, but that's something that investors might be looking for. Okay, I'm sure there will be no shortage of people with ideas as to how they should change the business. And we heard just one of them there in the introduction, Alex. What about key movement of personnel then? We're hearing about one particular executive leaving the company. What does this tell us if anything? Yeah, we've seen some allies, to top ally of Chapeck seemingly leaving the head of the kind of media distribution arm, I think it is. And it seems as though maybe some power had been pulled towards him as part of this decision-making creative process. Now, that is kind of being undone and we're seeing Bob Iger, as we say, go back to this old model that he had before, the one that seemed to work for him so well. Now, the thing is this is a slightly different situation now from the company that he left. When he left Disney, they weren't they had Disney plus, they weren't kind of all in on Disney plus in the way that Chapeck was because there had been an activist investor came in early in the pandemic and they had said, cut the dividend, use the capital to invest in Disney plus, turn the company into a growth stock similar to Netflix. The valuation was rewarded as a consequence, the price to earnings ratio overtook that of Netflix, but since then we've seen growth stocks punished. The valuations of both those companies have come down. So for all of the internal stuff to do with the creative process, ultimately there's capital allocation issues, which are really what the market's going to be looking at. All right, Bloomberg Quick Takes, Alex Webb, thank you so much. And what Alex was just talking about, how growth stocks have started to fare differently, how things have changed since the pandemic is translating to another stock I want to pay attention to in pre-market trading this morning. That would be Zoom reported it's slowest sales growth on record and trimmed its full year revenue forecast, really showing how those stay at home pandemic darlings have seen their fates change in a dramatic way in the aftermath. This stock is down 85% from its peak in October of 2020, it is adding to those losses this morning after its results down about 9% before the bell. Another stock moving fractionally lower that is worth. Oh, actually now higher, game stop up about 7.10 of 1%. But this is after a loss of about 9% yesterday. Of course, it has been wrapped up in the FTX saga. Also, we got news overnight last night that Carl Icon has built up a large short position in this stock. So that is one to watch. And another stock I've just been watching over the last several weeks is Tesla. There are a number of headwinds at play here, including its China business with now about a fifth of the Chinese economy equivalent on lockdown. Also, the fact that Elon Musk seems pretty distracted by Twitter. So this is a stock down more than 20% in the month of November so far, but a little bit of recovery happening this morning with the stock up about 1% before the bell. Okay, let's get back to where we started this hour. In fact, Kaylee in the news around the OECD, the OECD just released its latest economic outlook predicting global growth will slow to 2.2%. Next year, we'll be hearing from the OECD's acting chief economist next hour. That's a 6.30 AM in New York, 11.30 AM in London.

19198," from 30 a.m. in London. This hour we'll speak with Anna Stupnikska, the Fidelity International Global Macro economist. What does she make of the OECD's assessment? How ahead of the market or otherwise is that assessment of growth for next year? What does she make of the UK lines comparing them to the G7? This is Blaineberg. If you do any kind of business in this country, there's a pretty good chance that you're going to see that business registered in Delaware. Why? Because that's where you do it. And our point was Wyoming can be that venue for blockchain enterprise for crypto. It's not the Wyoming way to sit around and wait for change. We want that independence, we want that freedom, we want that individuality, and that's a common theme that brings together bipartisan support for this in Wyoming. We want to make sure that people understand, especially in Wyoming, but as the United States as a whole, this trend is coming. It's not going to stop. This is more of a small town that's growing into what I would call the cryptocurrency version of Silicon Valley. It's the philosophy of that rugged individualism, the independence, and the ability to really get things done for yourself and control your own destiny.

Visit Bloomberg.com webinars. Welcome back to Bloomberg Surveillance. This is the early edition. I'm Matt Miller with Kayleigh Lines here in New York and Edwards with us out of London. I'm looking at volatility and it's surprising to me that we've seen, well, we've all seen and felt this huge uptick in bond market volatility. That's this blue line here in FX volatility. That's this yellow line for those you listening on radio. Those lines are higher. A line that is lower is equity volatility. And why isn't it keeping up? Joining us to talk about this is Priscilla Azaveto, Rocha Bloomberg credit reporter. So Priscilla, how come bonds are seeing so much volatility when we're not really feeling it in the equity indexes? Well, hi, Matt. So bonds, they like the moves in markets, they permeate lower to bonds when compared to equity markets, right? In equity markets, they react to headlines faster than bonds. So in bonds is literally the result of a year of really bad returns for investors and that's what we're seeing. That's what we're seeing then at that level. What about the big macro picture at the moment, Priscilla? I'll take some where we've got you on the whole Fed expectations saga around the terminal rates and how much hiking there is still to go. Yesterday we heard from May or Daily emphasising the need to consider lags, but even she was saying that doesn't mean we're done with hiking rates, there's more hiking to come. Yes, that's right. So basically investors, they are looking at the broader picture, right? Because you have a lot of volatility markets still and you need to look at the broader picture instead of particular comments because otherwise you'll be trading on the headlines. So investors, they are focusing on the Fed's ultimate message, which is to contain inflation. And when we talk about containing things.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1812,2022-11-22 10:20:43
19199," be trading on the headlights. So investors, they are focusing on the feds ultimate message, which is to contain inflation. And when we talk about containing things, Priscilla, if we could speak about China for a moment, because I noticed in the Bank of America fund managers survey that came out last week when people were asked where the biggest risk of a credit event emanating from, the answer was China. China has taken steps to shore up the property market. We thought they were moving toward reopening. Now there's some question marks around that as COVID cases rise, just what is risk look like in that market in particular at the moment? Risk is still very much elevated. As you said, they're doing things to contain the property market and this is very positive for investors. But at the same time, questions linger around the reopening schedule, right? We've seen this morning headlines that this might be pushed post-winter when COVID infections go higher and there's more risks there. So we are still unsure about the timeline and when we're going to see China opening again. Okay, thanks very much, Priscilla.

19200," MUSIC MUSIC MUSIC This is Bloomberg Surveillance Early Edition. I'm Kaley Lines with Matt Miller in New York and Anna Edwards in London. Now keeping you up to date with news from around the world, here's the first word. In China, an increase in COVID cases has led local authorities to reintroduce measures like expanding testing and lockdowns. It's now estimated that a fifth of the country's economy has been affected. That's despite Beijing's call for more targeted, less disruptive COVID-0 measures. Goldman Sachs is forecasting that the S&P 500 and its earnings will change little next year. The firm expects margins will contract due to upward cost pressures from wages, commodities, goods and services. Goldman urged investors to own defensive sectors with low interest rate risk like healthcare and consumer staples. Billionaire investor Carl Icon holds a large short position in GameStop. Bloomberg has learned that Icon began shorting the video game retailer during the height of the mean stock frenzy around January 2021. Shares have lost 71% of their value since then. And the richest person in the world has seen his wealth decline by more than $100 billion this year. According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Elon Musk's fortune has fallen to a little less than $170 billion after Monday's $8.6 billion loss. His stake in electric car maker Tesla comprises the bulk of his fortune. Those shares have fallen 52% this year. And that raises a question of how much of that is really for fundamental business reasons for Tesla with concerns around China, for example. And how much of it is key man risk? Because this is a man that looks very, very distracted on Twitter. He does. I do think it's fascinating that even after losing $100 billion, he is still the richest man in the world. If you type RICH rich go into your Bloomberg terminal, you can see that he's still well ahead of Bernard Arno, Gauda Amadani, Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Warren Buffett. So he's still way up there, Anna. Yeah, let's see if he keeps tweeting and we'll see what happens to Twitter and all the money he put into it, won't we? Let's tell you what's coming up in the program. We'll speak to Ghostbomont, ABN Amaro, senior fixed income strategist. We're just 23 having stores, 2023 having store when it comes to fixed income markets. Does he expect rates to fall? Does he think demand for fixed income will return? We will talk about whether we'll see a turnaround for fixed income fortunes in the year ahead. This is Minkake. Today, what are the biggest challenges for general dynamics and what are the biggest opportunities? So I think in any business, the challenges are solving complex problems that come to you. You know, the problems that come to me and my senior leadership team for resolving tend to be highly complex and nettlesome. So your ability to solve those complex problems is an important element. I think of the value that we have.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1814,2022-11-22 10:29:35
19201," for resolving tend to be highly complex and nettlesome. So your ability to solve those complex problems is an important element, I think, of the value that we add to the company. And then I think opportunities, you always want to make sure that you've got a creative enough mind and open enough mind to be able to see around square corners. What am I missing? The why questions are really powerful. Why are we not doing this? So why are we doing this? I ask those questions a lot, and in the answers, you can sometimes tease out some real opportunities, some hidden things. But thinking creatively about opportunities and problems is really important. What about the industry generally? I think they have big challenges now as the defense budget probably comes down a bit. So I think that we are all responsible. And we have an obligation to find the latest and best technologies that we can for our customers and deliver them in the most cost-effective manner we can. And I think that that's a challenge and an opportunity for all of the big defense companies. MUSIC The markets come down in Europe. From the financial centers of the world, Bloomberg markets European flows with Guy Johnson in London and Alex Steele in New York, real-time numbers, real-time analysis weekdays. Bloomberg's covering all things crypto, the people, the transactions and the technology. Bloomberg crypto today on Bloomberg. MUSIC This is Bloomberg's surveillance earlier this year. Here's what you need to know. More fallout from the collapse of FTX, digital asset brokerage Genesis is warning that it may need to file for bankruptcy if it can't raise new capital. Socialist general and Alliance Bernstein are teaming up in a new partnership. The two will merge large parts of their equities trading businesses into a joint venture. And Bob Iger takes his first steps toward reshaping Disney. Iger wants his deputies to rethink the corporate structure and he announces that a top manager is leaving. I'm Anna Edwards in London with Matt Miller and KG Lines in New York and Matt. I know it's a holiday, short and weak in the US. It is starting to feel a little bit like that. Plus we have the distraction of football here in Europe, of course. And that definitely weighed on volumes actually in yesterday's session. How does the future picture look state side? Yeah, I mean, it feels that way as well here. I can't wait to go home to the great state of Ohio. And it's a football week for us too, obviously, as we get to beat Michigan on Saturday in the horseshoe. So I'm excited for that. S&P futures right now up about 2 tenths of 1%. So a little bit of gains here as we see the yield on the 10 year come down. 379. 32 is the level there. Crew coming back up after the roller coaster ride we had yesterday are the Saudis going to boost output for some odd unknown reason or they can continue with their 2 million barrel OPEC plus output cut. That makes more sense. And so the market is now buying oil, both the 9x crew and Brent on that. Bitcoin right now is up just a little bit. But this measures the move from, I think, midnight or from 5 p.m. yesterday. It doesn't matter. The point is 15,720 is the level. And that's the lowest level that we've seen basically since this time in 2020. So the lowest level that we've seen in two years, 15,718. And the question is, will it fall further as we get more fall out from FTX? Anna, what do you see in terms of, or sorry, Kaley, what do you see in terms of the US market, pre-market? God, you remember my name, Matt. Well, I am, of course, always watching crypto-related stocks. But I have my ions of other movers in pre-market trading this morning, one of them being Zoom, of course, a pandemic era, darling. That is not such a darling anymore. It reported earnings after the bell yesterday. Slowest revenue growth on record plus it trimmed. It's full year forecast. So that stock is down about 9% and remember, it's already down 85% from its all time high in October of 2020. Tesla, though, is rebounding up about 1%, but it has had a brutal November down about 20% over the course of this month so far because of headwinds from China and Elon Musk being distracted by Twitter, a lot to watch for that stock in particular. And on the subject of China, of course, we saw overnight Chinese technology stocks under pressure in the Asian trade as we contend with the COVID outbreak headlines in China about a fifth of the Chinese...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1815,2022-11-22 10:33:49
19202," particular and on the subject of China, of course, we saw overnight Chinese technology stocks under pressure in the Asian trade as we contend with the COVID outbreak. Headlines in China about a fifth of the Chinese economy is under restricted restrictions for the virus right now. So as a result, JD.com is down about 3% and you got Billy Billy down by a little more than 2% as well. And yeah, now time for Europe. Let's have a look at the European picture then. Stokes in Europe up by full sense of 1% led by energy up by 3.6% for energy names. Here and this as a result, of course, of all the volatility that Matt was alluding to. We saw that in markets yesterday went down as low as 82 dollars on Brent back up to 87 also as the market dealt with the reports then denied in terms of what's going on with oil production out of Saudi Arabia. So city general down by 7.10% of 1% they're putting together their equities business, the cash trading bit and the research part with the same type of business and alliance burns. They're going to have 51% though crucially over at Sockgene of that joint venture and NL in focus that stock is up by 1.1% asset sales at this company. This is an energy business previously very much a fossil fuels energy business that they've been buying up all kinds of renewable energy assets. They've got a debt burden now and now they're having to sell off some of those. So South America there reducing their exposure there and also in Eastern Europe. All right, so we'll continue to pay attention to what goes on over there. I'm also continuing to see headlines come across this armoured from Kier Starmler saying that labor should start a private wealth fund of a sovereign wealth fund. I guess it's called when a country does it and that the Brexit deal isn't working but that the UK needs to make Brexit work. It's always interesting to me how conservative the labor party is starting to sound. Let's get right now to Yost Beaumont, ABM Amaro senior fixed income strategist and Yost, I want to ask you the same question I asked a fixed income report that we had on earlier. Why so much volatility in fixed income really fixed income and FX are seeing a lot more volatility than equities right now? I think that's that's largely related of course to financial markets now being in a kind of talk of war about what central banks will do. Will they continue to hike aggressively or will they have reached a bit of a peak and will they slow down rate hikes or even stop tightening monetary policy? And that of course determines the rate in the in the bull market so so therefore I guess we we see this this volatility spiking. And does that set is that set to continue that volatility? Yost, we still try to grapple with where the terminal rate is and how long we take to get there. Do you think we are near the top and what does that do to that level of volatility? Yeah, I think we will continue to see quite a lot of volatility of course it's still very uncertain times and I think markets run a little bit ahead of themselves after the US inflation numbers. What was it recently when they fall well okay the Fed is will slow down rate hikes etc and so riskier as that's actually doing pretty pretty well. The outlook for the economy is still pretty dark we will enter a recession a deep one in the years on a more shallow one in the in the US at the same time we will see central banks being rather hawkish. We've seen it on the Bloomberg wires are common from central bankers they need to keep hiking interest rates so 50 basis point for the ECB is more or less a done deal. We expect 50 basis points more in Q1 but yeah next year will be different story to be honest. And thinking about what the ECB does Yost they're also changing the way that the Telto's program works so that's the cheap loan program they have to the banking sector and many banks deciding to pay back early or and there's some changing rules happening there. What is it the banks are going to be selling to enable them to pay back those loans and is that something we need to be aware of? Yeah good question yeah it's it's actually quite quite interesting we wrote quite a note about it and and banks have a lot of access cash park at the ECB so the first means to repay T-Alpha loans early would in my view be be cash that they are not using and it's just stored at the ECB. That can already be covered quite a large part of repay.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1816,2022-11-22 10:38:03
19203," time view be cash that they are not using and is just stored at the ECB. That can already be covered quite a large part of repayments. Otherwise banks might need to sell some holdings of government bombs or other highly liquid assets, but actually banks haven't really beefed up these investments since the high take-ups of the T-Altro. So actually it will be mainly cash and maybe they will issue a little bit of more bombs to refinance. What do you expect from corporate issuance in the coming year-yost? I'm not really a corporate specialist actually, but given of course, especially if you look for the energy transition companies in that area need to invest quite a lot. So there we can see maybe a bit of a pick up, but I'm more looking at bank issuance and just finished a bit the supply forecast and there we see the importance in the cover bombs space in the Euro-denominated area we see in a record year of issuance this year and actually next year we will continue to see quite large issuance volumes there. And also in the senior non-preferred space I expect banks to be rather active. So it will be a busy year and that is of course also related to banks cannot rely on the cheap funding of central banks any longer. They need to rely more on wholesale funding. We might also see loan to deposit ratios going up again as households need to tap their savings to pay for energy bills, higher mortgage bills and their groceries. So that also means banks need to issue more on the wholesale market and of course despite recession we still expect bank loan growth to continue to be positive or be it less strong than we've seen in previous years. Jo, do you mention how there's no longer cheap financing from central banks? We're also focused on what ultimately the terminal rate is, how long we stay up at the peak, but there's also a question of where we get back down to. Are we ever going back to the zero low interest rate world ever again? I think that is quite unlikely to be almost in that respect we really seen a paradigm shift where central banks are now more in titanning mode, governments of course in supporting mode and that's the clear difference from the past from say after the global financial crisis. I think that is likely to remain the case, but if you look for central banks, next we will see inflation coming down. You already see pipeline inflation, repressions reducing gas prices have gone down, food prices are coming down, electricity prices are coming down. So next we will see inflation coming down, we will see economies struggling, so that will actually also lead to a change in the tone of central banks and actually we expect the Fed and the ECB already to start cutting rates in the second half of next year. Yoast, thanks very much, thanks for joining us. Yoast, the bow-monger of ABN, Ambrouh, thanks for coming in. Stu speaks was on the program, coming up, we'll continue some of these conversations with Anna Stupmanska, who joins us, Fidelity International Global Macro economist, just what are the prospects for recession in the United States next year? How does she reflect on what the OECD has announced bringing down its estimates for global growth? With that, you will see bursting fire in the last handful of recent submissions.

19204," When you think space you probably think one space agency that travels under the radar is ESA which is surprising considering what the European space agency has achieved and how vital it is to look local space industry. We've collaborated with pretty much everybody who is involved in space exploration. But ESA wants to be a leading force in furthering humanity's mission into space. If we want to have a successful human missions to Mars we are going to have to learn to live a work off-world in a different way. The place where we are going to learn to do that is on the move. And ESA help humanity take its next giant leap. Power, policy, politics, from the White House to the Hill. Bloomberg covers the leaders in legislation. That was really a tectonic shift for this White House. The theory of this bill as I understand it is there will be a multiplier effect. How to Democrats mobilize specifically younger voters. Bringing you the political news you need to know. The president has made it very clear that this is a significant focus. For the intersection of Wall Street and Washington, nobody covers politics like Bloomberg. This is Bloomberg's Availants Early Edition. I'm Anna Edwards in London with Matt Miller and Katie Lines in New York. When it's new economic outlook, the OECD sees a significant slowdown in global growth next year. But it's not expecting a recession. Joining us now is Anna Stubnizka, a global macro economist at Fidelity International. I think that's on a global basis. Not expecting that recession. We can get into the U.S. in a moment. But sticking to the global then, Anna, thanks for coming to talk to us. The OECD predicts that global economic growth will slow to 2.2% in 2023. How does that fit in with your analysis? I think it makes sense. We do expect a recession in the key development markets as well. I think 2.2, even though it's still positive growth, but not a recession. It's still a significant slowdown for global growth. Looking at the trend that we have seen in the past few years, a recession would probably be around 1% on a global basis. So we are still above that, but it does fit with our view on the recession. I think it's consensus now. The main question for us is how deep the recession is going to be and how long? Let me ask you about the U.S. specifically. How convinced about recession are you there? There seems to be quite a range of expectations. I know a lot of economists think we are going to see a recession. If you look at some of the Fed's models, they put quite a low probability on U.S. recession next year. A lot of different estimates. We do think our model show the probability of recession is somewhere between 50 and 60%. This is our base case scenario. We characterize this recession scenario, though, as either a cyclical recession. So some recession that comes about as a result of the shocks that we are seeing. But mainly as a result of policy-titing or a balance sheet recession. So where rates go so high that it triggers issues or deteriorated issues. And we don't see that balance sheet recession just yet, although risk is very high. So we are carefully watching. So our base case is a recession in the U.S. but relatively shallow for the tundee. Yeah, it's worth noting you may have just seen on the full screen here that Bloomberg economics model puts the probability at 100%. Which is pretty strong to say the least. In Europe, is it going to be much worse? Will we see a short shallow recession here and a much deeper longer recession in the UK and the EU? I think potentially deeper in Europe than in the U.S. Obviously given all the issues we know about. And then certainly related to the war.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1818,2022-11-22 10:46:46
19205," I think potentially deeper in Europe than in the US, obviously given all the issues we know about, and then certainly related to the war, the war still ongoing, and there's no end in sight. It seems the UK is particularly vulnerable on a number of metrics, and we are talking a lot now about the potential issues in the housing sector, and again, the housing sector is cracking across the world and major developed markets, but again, the UK seems particularly vulnerable to that interest-raised shock, to the income shock that is upcoming. So potentially, yes, recession can be very deep in the UK. In terms of what we see in other countries, how does it look around the world? I mean, we're always so focused on the UK, Europe and the US, but of course you've got Asia and emerging markets to think about as well as the rest of North and South America. Yeah, well, that's quite a long list of countries. I just wanted to say in terms of the housing market, what we are watching, and as I said, this is mainly developed markets, but of course, the hotspots, we know countries like Norway, Sweden, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, this is where the housing markets have been overheating a lot over the past few years and didn't even suffer in the global financial crisis. Now that shock is going through the system and we have to carefully watch what that means for those countries, but also potentially can return into more systemic shock to the rest of the economy. As far as emerging markets are concerned, as we know, a lot depends on China. China is transitioning. We don't expect that it's going to bounce back really quickly, given all the COVID-related restrictions and of course the restructuring, that very complex transition process. So again, very selective across the AM, but we do think that Asia-Pacific potentially, excluding Japan, can do quite well as China starts re-bounding very slowly in 23. And just because you brought it up, I would point everyone watching and listening to the big take story on the Bloomberg and online today, which talks about the housing market in Canada and how it is defleating in a very material ray. If I could just pick up on your point on China, though, I'm trying to get a grip on how that story plays into the growth and inflation picture, because on the one hand, if China doesn't come online in the immediate term or at least medium term, that is not great for the global growth story, considering it's the second largest economy. So in theory, that gives central banks a boost on the inflation fighting side. In terms of the PBOC or I mean, yeah, of course, for the ECB or the Federal Reserve who wants to see inflation get down, China demand coming back and boosting commodity prices as a result seems like it would make that job a lot harder. No, that's true. Of course, if we see a really big bounce in China growth and demand coming back, that would boost inflation and that would spill over to the rest of the world. So certainly this is one risk factor in the way. As I said, the base case, we don't expect this to happen. So in terms of that inflation pressure, China is probably not going to decide an issue for the rest of the world. But actually, it doesn't even need to be an issue because this inflation issue is so well entrenched in other countries that the central banks will still have to continue fighting it and keeping financial conditions very strict for a long time. Well, to that point, Anna, we have heard from central bankers, regional Fed presidents for the Federal Reserve, for example, continuing to reiterate that message. We are going to continue to fight inflationist until the job is done. How much of that do you think is the Fed actually forecasting what it will do? And how much is that them just talking the talk to push back against an easing in financial conditions? Yeah, part of it, of course, is expectations in terms of that trying to send that message to control inflation expectations to some extent. And it is working, yes, they are pushing back against the easing in financial conditions. But, you know,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1819,2022-11-22 10:51:05
19206," to control inflation expectations to some extent. And it is working, yes, they're pushing back against the easing and financial conditions. But ultimately, they are watching not the markets. They're watching not the survey data, not the sub-data, but the hard data. And of course, the hard data is lagging, so inflation, labor market, et cetera. So they might be sending some signals and sort of preparing the market for restrictive stands for longer. Which they will have to achieve, actually, physically, without just guiding the market, but actually getting there, because inflation is so sticky. And actually, they already in the restrictive territory. And we don't think that the talk, the expectation of the pivot, the long-awaited pivot that I've been talking about all year. But don't think it's relevant anymore. They are going into restrictive territory, probably, to 5% or so in terms of policy rate. And it doesn't matter what they say, because that is going to continue damaging growth, damaging earnings, and putting pressure on financial conditions. OK, Anna, thank you very much for your analysis, Anna Stripnitzker of Fidelity. And we'll continue to focus on the global economy. Coming up in the next hour, we'll hear from the OECD's Acting Chief Economist, that conversation at 6.30 AM in New York, 11.30 AM in London. This is being done. Great, Wayne, thank you. When I started, I had no idea it was going to turn into this. It was a trix new empire. I don't have any investor. All this is all money in. This is me going out in Hustlin, bringing that money back, and just building it, building it, and building it. Yeah, I think about a person that was homeless at one point. Didn't really have any money coming in. The fact that this person was relentless and just determined to succeed and not let rock bottom define him as an individual. I can take things and put them together and take them apart and make them better and put them back together. I respect the craft, so I don't want to minimize and disrespect the value of each step of the craft. And do by machine what should be done by hand. You've got to explain this one to me. What does it mean when the White House says we're watching markets carefully? It means they have a Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. They have. I've been in and seen it. Lots of Bloomberg. I've seen it. I've seen the Bloomberg, I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg.

19207," This is Lumeric Surveillance Early Edition. I'm Kayley Lines with Matt Miller in New York and Anna Edwards in London. Now let's take a quick look at what is coming up for the rest of today. South African President, Cyril Ramaphosa, will be meeting with King Charles III on his first day of his state visit in the UK. Then Hungary will be releasing a rate decision at 8 AM Eastern. Central Bank is expected to keep its monthly base interest rate unchanged. On the economic data front, Euro Area consumer confidence will cross at 10 AM Eastern time. Plus we'll hear from more Fed speakers including Loretta Mester, again, as well as Jim Bullard. And finally, we'll also be watching the FTX bankruptcy hearing in Delaware, Matt. And if only that were the only crypto related bankruptcy thing we are watching. But we also are watching Genesis, which is warned if it can't raise a billion dollars, it could have to file as well. That's right. And it obviously affects, we've been talking about Gemini's lending project. Of course, Genesis is the very silver related entity and Gemini is the Winkelvi exchange. So it's interesting to see two other huge companies in crypto could go bankrupt because of the FTX bankruptcy. After all that we're hearing, it doesn't seem like it doesn't seem like this would be the end of the contagion completely because of course those two have counterparty risk as well. Yeah, it's really interesting, I think, Matt, how much we're talking about trust when it comes to crypto, when this is a business that isn't supposed to really be based on trust, but around facts. And this was true of the accounts attached to FTX. We've been warned not to trust those. I saw our colleagues reporting that Bane had been advising Tiger Global on its investments in FTX. How much can you trust that kind of due diligence? And our colleagues also trying to get to the bottom of who owns certain exchanges, one in China for example, where it's not entirely clear. So it's really interesting the way that old finance is meeting this sort of, what the defi essentially. Yeah, it's fascinating and I think, you know, we have to differentiate between the businesses built on, you know, selling the picks and shovels here and the actual gold or the actual Bitcoin right now. It looks like the currency is holding up relatively well at just under $16,000. So only a two year low. Only, of course, we'll continue this conversation later on today, Matt. On Bloomberg crypto, that's at 1 p.m. New York Times, 6 p.m. in London. So don't miss that. More Bloomberg surveillance is ahead. This is Bloomberg. So as you look back on your career, what would you say is the best investment advice you've ever received? Probably the best investment advice that I never received, but that I've lived my whole life around, is surround yourself with really good people. I thought about it just today like I do many times, you know, what makes a great investor. A great investment firm is comprised of people who are optimists and pessimists and realists. Because in the intersection of the debates that go across that wide range of personalities is where you find truth. It's part of the reason I'm so focused on freedom of expression.

I see it my own four walls, the robust and fulsome debates around how we commit our capital, what defines a good idea, what businesses to build or pursue. That's what drives the success at Citadel. And I've been very fortunate in life to have always had a group of friends who really push me who make me better.

Why do the biggest names in business choose Bloomberg? Great question. Great question. Great question. Best question I get all night. Remember top experts. Great questions. We're going through an inflection point right now. Like we saw earlier this summer. The economy is rolling over. The data is rolling over. And as hockey's just the fed wants to talk, the markets are starting not to listen to it. We don't really know how far and how fast inflation before. A lot depends on what the Fed does. If the Fed slows down, they're very rapid rate of increase. Will that allow us to avoid a recession? We're still going to get a recession at some point although maybe not right away. This is Bloomberg's surveillance with Tom Keane, Jonathan Farrow and Lisa Abramowitz. Good morning everyone. Jonathan Farrow, Lisa Ramon's and Tom Keane on radio and television. We're in a holiday mode. No, we are not. It is a busy Tuesday up to the economic onslaught. The data dump that we get tomorrow. The data dump this morning is the price of Bitcoin. Dom summing Disney's there. There's a story. That story. Maybe oil's a story. We'll give you full world cup coverage. But Lisa Abramowitz. It really probably. Guess what? Bitcoin, front and center, should alley-basic to join us in 15 minutes. It's not just what we have seen in FTX. This is not just an idiosyncratic moment. We're also seeing it in others. We're also seeing the potential for a big bankruptcy that is much more substantial with Genesis potentially filing. If they do not raise funds, this is the Winkle Vias. We call them and how much you end up. They're in the story, aren't they? Yeah. With something that is more of a contagion event, all up Peter Sheer's comments. Yes, to remind people that aren't involved in crypto, Winkle Vi are two twins where people quake, well, excuse me, women quake and stop in their tracks when they come into the Bloomberg building. And these guys are challenged, aren't they? Well, I'm not going to weigh in on the Winkle Vias. They're not going to come back. They're challenged this morning with Genesis and the rest. There is a question, an existential question of what's behind this. Is this an asset class that was built up in the area of free money that is coming down and to what? And I think the question is, why have we not seen further fallout as of yet? It's bringing up to date. Robin Wiggles worth in the financial times publishing an hour ago, a brilliant sum of this quoting at length, Sinali Bassic, and our crypto team reporting on Genesis. And we'll have that for you, a 15,700 on Bitcoin after an ugly overnight as well. Well, I will say that to me that real tone is, last week we saw a shift. We saw better than expected news out of China, better than expected news with respect to the energy story in Europe. Yeah, not there. Exactly. This week we're not seeing the same thing. We're seeing worse news out of China with lockdowns affecting potentially a fifth of the entire economy. You're seeing a cold snap in Europe that's testing some of the resolve that we have seen in terms of how much build up of energy they have. And we're not necessarily seeing the fallout in markets, right? There's still resilience. And so here's the question, why are we not seeing more? Because they're looking at the Fed and doing the parlor game out the December 14th, I would suggest. Our guest is so important today. We're going to get right to it with a data check and Lisa's refutures up eight as she says. There's a lift to the market. It's fractional. It's even two tenths of a percent including the Dow Jones industrial average. John from Doha emails in and says Tom more quotes of the Dow is the VIX 22.44. Yeah.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1822,2022-11-22 11:04:10
19209," More quotes of the Dow is the VIX 22.44 yield. Well, a little bit of a story today with yield coming in, maybe some of the angst that Lisa's talking about, dollar churning after a strong dollar yesterday in Yen 141.30. And I got to go to oil, which is sort of all over the proverbial petrol map, 80.58 on American oil, up nicely here on news over the last two days as well. I made a Tuesday before Thanksgiving brief. All right, well, let's talk about it. It definitely is a Tuesday before Thanksgiving brief. We do get a slew of earnings, including some retailers, including Dick's, Sporting Goods, Burlington stores, analog services. To me, I'm really interested to hear from Dollar Tree. Before market, Dollar Tree has done really well this year up more than 24%. Wow. And this is typical because usually the dollar stores, the discounters do best in a downturn. I am watching to see what their outlook is, given that people are downshifting in the face of higher inflation and lower discretionary spending today. The roster of, as we guess, carry it. Dollar Tree, I got to interrupt you. You go to TRA on the Bloomberg terminal. We got to sell the terminal today, so it can pay for the bird. Dollar Tree, per year, last 10 years, 14.4% per year. Yeah. No one guessed that. I didn't guess that. No. And it really speaks to the channel of two Americas, which I think is really interesting. I'm so sorry for interrupting. If I speak, I'll never ever ever again. Please, everybody just note that. He just said that he would never interrupt again. I'm going to hold up a sign every time it happens again, because we'll happen again probably in this show. Fed speak today includes Cleveland Fed President, Lorde Amester Kansas City Fed President, Esther George, and St. Louis Fed President, Jim Bullard. Tommy, we're talking about how we were hearing the roster of Fed speakers perhaps moving away from a hawkish stance. I don't know. The interpretation of the rhetoric is the same that we've heard before. They're going to necessarily downshift, but that's not necessarily bullish because they're not going to go to a lower term. And we heard from the city group yesterday with comments on Bullard tilting just 7% terminal rate. I think he's got to recapitulate that today and finesse what he meant by moving the markets with a 7% yield. I mean, that's a stunning statistic. I mean, although he did move it for about a half a second, then it went right back down. So we'll see who's sort of narrative is the dominant one. For one PM. There is an auction. This one's a really interesting one, Tom. $35 billion of seven-year notes from US Treasury Department. Why is a seven-year important versus the five and the 10? What is it some in-betweening maturity? It's a less liquid security. It tends to be a messier auction because there isn't necessarily. I'm not talking to you like you're a dummy. You're asking why I think it's interesting. I'm telling you why I think it's interesting. I like the seven-year auction. Look at those yields. Nearly 4%. There's been a distortion here. A lot of people seem to like this area. OK. OK. We'll go there. We'll give you the World Cup schedule in a minute. I'm looking it up. I think Argentina. Did you watch yesterday? I watched a little bit. Yesterday, that was fun. I mean, the US game was like, wow. They should have won. Well, you know, but Garith's Garith, you know, we've talked that for David Blanchflaude to give us expertise on this in the coming days. Unlike me. On his whales. On Denmark, I believe playing that a Yens Nordvik joins his founder and CEO of Exantidata. Come on, Yens. World stops. Denmark, Tunisia's well. What do you think? Denmark is really percolating with a chance here to make some noise. Yeah, we'll hopefully can do a little bit like England that yesterday. OK. So that turns comment there. Yeah, let's get to it with a dollar. What is the 2023 view here on the dollar? There's been big figures moves this year. Can there be big figure moves next year? So this year has been essentially one of the strongest in the history of the dollar, right? Massive run up against some of the biggest currencies in the world, like seen the Yen move and so forth. And then in the last couple of weeks, we've seen a big reversal within that bull move. And our positioning indicators that we track at Exantidata have had some of the most extreme signals, right? Real money investors were very, very overweight dollars. All the trend following investors were really maxed long dollars. And we had this very violent washout. So now everybody kind of has to decide, OK, is this really a big change in trend? Or is it just some kind of...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1823,2022-11-22 11:08:33
19210," very violent wash out. So now everybody kind of has to decide, okay, is this really a big change in trend or is it just some kind of repositioning in the market and the repositioning was definitely a big piece of what was going on and we could already see as soon as the news from China, which was actually quite important to the turn in the dollar overall. As soon as that is less positive, the dollar kind of looks like it wants to go back to the appreciating trend, right? So I think for me, the key is global growth. We can talk about the Fed and the Fed is important, but the most important variable for the dollar is what's going on with global growth. And if we still have a problematic growth situation in China, if Europe doesn't recover, then it's hard for me to see that there's going to be a strategic turn in the dollar. We can have like Wiggles and we've had a big wiggle now over the last couple of weeks, but a strategic turn requires that global growth is going to get better. And for me, that's too early to make that call. We can go into detail with that. Yes, you were talking about China and that was sort of giving some fuel to this risk appetite, the idea that perhaps they were tiptoeing away from COVID-0. It seems like it's the opposite today and yet the narrative and the market is not cooperating. You're not seeing the off-move and equities. You're not seeing a strengthening dollar. What do you make of this? The idea that a lot of the reasons behind the rally are turning on their head, but the market is not. So the first thing I would say is that there's been optimism around China, right? And the optimism was based on the notion that there was going to be a move away from Cyril COVID policy. And what we're seeing in China is that there might be a desire to somehow relax those policies that have had a disastrous impact on the economy, but isn't really feasible, right? We now have cases that are skyrocketing. We have a population that has been told that COVID was very scary and something that should be avoided at all costs. And this could go on for a long time in the sense that they only have around called it 20,000 cases per day, right? Like go back to when we had a peak in the United States, which is a smaller country population wise, where we had a million per day, right? So this, we're in the early phase of acceleration and this could go on for a long time and they're just going to let it run. That would be a pretty strange way for them to go from one extreme to the other. So it's going to be a gradual, messy process here. I think it's going to be hard for the market to cope with that. Although that seems like they're coping with it right now. Heading into 2023, it seems like the consensus is you might see some more dollar strength and then it'll turn into dollar weakness. You will see Europe start to outperform. You will see Asia start to outperform. You will see the US underperform. Where do you push back against the consensus right now? Yeah. It all comes down to inflation and inflation expectations, right? We saw after the CPI print, one CPI print that was better than the trend we have had. Mark and Raleigh enormously. There was also after that that the dollar had one of its biggest moves ever in a few days. So it really comes down to inflation. Have we turned the corner? What we're going to have stick services prices? I think it's pretty clear that goods prices are sounds normalized. But the market is also hoping that services prices will also normalize. If that's not the case, it's going to be a big problem for risk assets, right? Because that's being priced now that the worst is over inflation. If that's not the case, we're going to be back to having risk assets under pressure. Yes, thank you. Go, Denmark. Ken's in Nordvik with us. It's a sounding data. I want to point out again, he won the beauty contest, the institutional investor, three years in a row in foreign exchange. I can think I could say no one's ever done that. I may stand corrected on that OECD out with a stunning look. Let's remind ourselves, Laurence Boone nailed this always a way. Inflation statistics, Lisa still 6.8% globally next year among OECD nations. That's not inflation going away. And it's the theme of hiking into weakness that they really highlight perhaps not a recession, but pretty darn close, particularly in the developed world.

19211," Stop what you're doing next. Shana Ali Basik on Genesis. Good morning, Bloomberg surveillance. Keeping you up to date with news from around the world with the first word, I'm Lisa Mateo. Well, digital asset brokerage Genesis is warning potential investors. It may have to file for bankruptcy unless it can raise money. Louberg's learned the firm is struggling to attract funding for its lending unit, which suspended withdrawals after the collapse of FTX. Now, Genesis has spent the last few days seeking at least a billion dollars in new capital. The OECD says central banks must keep raising rates to fight inflation, even as the global economy sinks into a slowdown. In a new report, the organization warned that inflation and its impact on real incomes will only get worse if policymakers fail to act. It raised forecasts for inflation next year. In China, an increasing COVID cases has led local authorities into reintroducing measures like expanding testing and lockdowns. It's now estimated that a fifth of the country's economy has been affected. That's despite the central government's call for more targeted, less disruptive, global COVID-0 measures. Disney's returning CEO Bob Eiger has taken his first steps towards reorganizing the entertainment giant. Eiger has asked his top deputies to rethink the corporate structure. Meanwhile, he announced the departure of a top manager, the head of media distribution, Kareem Daniel. And the richest person in the world has seen his fortune declined by more than $100 billion this year. According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Elon Musk's wealth has fallen to a little less than $170 billion after Monday's $8.6 billion loss. His stake in electrocarmaker Tesla comprises the bulk of Musk's fortune. Those shares fallen 52 percent this year. Global news, 24 hours a day on air and on Bloomberg. Quick take, powered by more than 2,700 journalists and analysts in more than 120 countries. I'm Lisa Mateo, this is Bloomberg. What do Formula One cars and your local supermarket have in common? Well, strange as it sounds, they might both be using the same technology. A lot of innovation has trickled down from the world of high tech engines and it hasn't just found a new life in road cars. F1 cars have long been thought of as the peak of cool and technology in them is also helping to pull down our produce aisles. Engineers from Williams are using their knowledge from nine constructors championships working with company Aerofoil to help reduce the energy consumption of supermarkets. The device they're building is based on the design of an F1 cars rear wing. It attaches to fridges to keep more cool air in the unit. They estimate they can reduce supermarket energy consumption by 25%. One innovation from F1 is also helping hybrid reduce their carbon footprint. That's curves or the kinetic energy recovery system. In common parlance, it's known as regenerative braking and works by storing energy of the car decelerating in a battery for later use. If that's not enough, F1 is now looking at hers or a thermal energy recovery system looking to harness the heat produced from braking and the engine exhaust. That could allow cars to generate the same power using 30% less fuel. So, while F1 may have a reputation as a gas guzzler.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1825,2022-11-22 11:17:13

I think we're going to see some selling off in Bitcoin. I think one of the things that supported it recently are the fact that there are a lot of whales who have invested interest in keeping it higher. Peter Sheer on fire yesterday. We went from Katie Griefeld with a reporting on FTX or FTX, whatever it's called over to Peter Sheer. It was really quite good. That picked up by the media. You know, like, you know, he really did the job yesterday. Honest, are you anymore knowledgeable on Bitcoin? Dogged and I, you know, I'm still not. Okay. I feel really dumb. The one thing that I will say is to conflate Bitcoin with the entire crypto universe is a no-no. I don't agree. I don't agree. I don't agree. Let's see if she knows. I think it's an underlying. John Feral on assignment today in Doha, Lisa Bramowitz and Tom King. We're going to drive forward the conversation now. And for those of you who are global wall street, it's simple. Lydia Bayud, Shanali Bassack and company put together an important update on Genesis Robin Wiggles. We're two hours ago on the FTX, quoted that story. It length here is we go into a movable feast of a difficult Tuesday for crypto. And that's what the classic joins us right now. What are you looking for to happen with Genesis this Tuesday? If they file for bankruptcy, how far does that contagion also go? So you have Genesis lending, which is that lending entity that had been kind of caught up in this liquidity crunch here in the Bitcoin industry. But it is part of the empire that is run by digital currency group that is very sober, former Hula-Hula Han, a creator here of what was a predecessor to NASDAQ. You don't agree. She doesn't think Bitcoin is the underlying. I just adamant about this. There is an underlying to every transaction. How linked is all the basic chat in the world you're in, what Katie Gryffelt's doing, the rest of you? How linked is that to the price of Bitcoin? Think about the freneticism over the last couple of days. As Genesis sought to raise money for this unit, they were calling finance. They were calling Apollo. And a lot of investors here were very concerned when they looked at it at the end of the day because they said, first of all, they're regulatory concerns here. Second of all, we're untangling all the contagion from the crypto industry. And third of all, it's like even investors here who wanted to get involved in the first place in this era can't get involved because of the aforementioned problems we've named. I guess another way to ask what Tom is asking is we often look at the price of Bitcoin as a reflection of the contagion. Is that an accurate way of gauging out the weakness? Or is this that Haven almost amid the storm in more peripheral crypto assets? The reason it's not...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1826,2022-11-22 11:21:27
19213," your way of gauging out the weakness or is this that haven almost amid the storm in more peripheral crypto assets? The reason it's not an accurate way is because people put real money into them by Bitcoin. And so the idea here that there's not an onboarding here is a false conception. What? And that it's not a real, it's not a fake asset that's flying in the ether. You pay money to buy Bitcoin. You use dollars to buy Bitcoin. You put your dollars in exchange. Let's take Coinbase's balance sheet, for example. It's $5 billion in cash, $95 billion in customer assets held one to one. People are worried about that one to one. Therefore you have Coinbase bonds trading at $0.50 on the dollar. Right. If they want to, on the dollar. So yes, to your point, your people are worried about the underlying. But these are still companies that if they are underlying, people are willing to pay for them. Why isn't there more transparency? There was a story today about FTX having actually more than expected reserves, right? That they had more than a billion dollars of cash that they found. And people thought, wow, you have money to give to creditors. Why are we looking under rocks and in the quitchens of a couch to try to find money for an institution that supposedly is real? Yeah. And that's the important part. We're talking about the institutions now, not the underlying Bitcoin. And so when you're looking at FTX or you're looking at Genesis, people are peeling back the curtain here and trying to see what is this entity, who owes who what. And what did they do with that money? But they're going into Delaware court today. Mr. Dunlop, he's an adult. The Delaware court is a claim. Mr. Muscle learn that for being an adult. What are the adults in the room going to say to this unregulated, unaudited, offshore industry? I mean, the broader industry as well as FTX, whatever it is. They're going to say exactly what they're saying now, which is how much money do you have? How many assets do you have? How come you don't you want to treat them like adults? They're going to treat them like adults. How are they going to get adult answers? They're going to try to. Yesterday, you had a, or over the weekend, you had a statement from FTX and they hired Perella Weinberg, real US investment bank, going back and looking at the assets, trying to figure out what assets they could sell, what assets they can recapitalize. And they're like, I said, this says a surveillance remote from the Bahamas is what it says. I think everything says. I think everything says surveillance. I think that surveillance in the Bahamas is. What everything says. I am wondering, Shnali, as you talk. There is a rumor. I don't want to spread rumors, but we've talked about it on this show before that perhaps certain institutions are so entrenched in this asset class that they have a vested interest in not mass selling and in trying to keep things afloat and finding an entry point. So how much are you hearing about that? That basically there is enough commitment to keep it going for now until something further breaks. A lot about that now because you could argue that this wasn't started with FTX. You could argue that this started months and months ago when the crack started forming in the Bitcoin industry to begin with. Oh, come on. This started when it was 60,000 and went to say 40,000. So how did it become 60,000? It was levered up to 60,000. Okay. That's the problem. And so now what you have is you have an instance where that leverage came off the system. Three arrows blew up. They had lenders and now you had Genesis, which was also a counterparty here, that DCG had also poured money into to try to bring out of that hole. And now everybody is feeling the pain from that hangover. How much surprise among the people who you speak to is that there is not more contagion, that there hasn't been greater fallout. We're in the middle of it. The reality is is neither Genesis nor BlockFi have filed for bankruptcy. We don't know who their creditors are, which means once we see more bankruptcies come to the surface here in the lending industry and many of my sources say maybe crypto lending is over, which then you wonder where that floor is once again when you don't have leverage in the system. Maybe at all for many, many years. So is this going to happen today? I mean, it's Thanksgiving week. Everybody's got their eyes are, you know, everybody's sliding through the week, given huge news flow. And that are you saying today for Genesis and Connecticut? They have said on the record that a filing is not imminent, but you have to wonder if part of the reason for that is because they keep on finding new people to reach out to. So we have reported finance. Can we reach out to the big banks? You can. Well, the big thing. Yeah, exactly. The reality is, is we've heard that Apollo is one of a number of...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1827,2022-11-22 11:25:57
19214," Yeah, exactly. And the reality is, is we've heard that Apollo is one of a number of traditional financial counterparties that have fielded calls here from Genesis. So now everybody's in it. Everybody is looking at the books. Everybody is thinking about what they can get if they get them. I'm watching you underlying 15,700 after a difficult 24 hours, a little bit of a bounce right now in big caught. I'm not going to pontificate about what I see there technically.

What do we see? 78 statistics tomorrow? I think so. A lot of news. Yeah, exactly. In particular with Fed meeting minutes, which you've gotten some more that you can skim tomorrow. But I am curious how we get a shaped narrative around how much inflation is starting to cool out a little bit. I noticed oil with an elevation last 10 minutes. Ukraine with an argument here with gas prom over natural gas flow and we'll have to continue to watch that. West Texas $81 up from a 78 level and Brent crude 88 63 dressed back towards a $90 level. We keep scoring at Bloomberg about who gets it right, who gets it wrong. We really pay attention to who gets it wrong and ask why. Always informative for global Wall Street. We particularly pay attention to people that absolutely nailed it. OECD in Paris, compending that large group of countries that they study and study and study have nailed the global slowdown, the vector of it, the slowdown that we see. And they further drive that to a 2.2% statistic for real global growth. Next year, Avarro Prairie joins us now. Acting Chief Economist at the OECD and of course with his Portuguese economics. And I'd also point out Avarro, your British Columbia cred, which tells me that it's all econometrics. How good are you now at OECD of guessing the statistic? Is it, do you have a lot of confidence and degrees of freedom in trying to guesstimate out to 2024? Well, Tom, it's a very challenging environment, but we have very confident about our forecast. We've been, as you said, we warned about the slowdown. And right now we're saying that, listen, we are facing the largest energy crisis since the 1970s. And we have a dramatic picture that shows exactly that governments around the OECD are spending around 18% of GDP just in energy. And this is as much as we did in the 70s and 80s. And so a very challenging environment, so feel very comfortable with our forecast. With your GDP growth slowdown from whatever it was in 2021 down to 3. Whatever down to 2.2, how does China play into that vector? Well, for China, we are, for a couple of remember, this year was the lowest growth for China since the 1970s with the exception of the height of the pandemic. And we are forecasting China next year to rebound to about 4.6%, but going down to 4.1% to 24%. But there are two risks that we think that can play this central scenario. First of all, it's fairly possible that if the street COVID lockdowns continue and they become more pervasive, then certainly growth is going to be a lot less than we are forecasting. And the second one has to do with real estate market. If the adjustment on the real estate market is less smooth than we would like it to be, it's very possible that also growth will be negatively affected in China.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1829,2022-11-22 11:34:34
19216," is very possible that also growth will be negatively affected in China. So we are seeing a bit of a rebound in China, but risks are certainly fairly high over there too. Alvaro, you pointed out that this is really an energy crisis, which isn't necessarily the way that everybody else would frame it. They would view it as a pandemic crisis. They would view it as a free money for decades kind of crisis that has come to a head. They would view it as an inflation crisis more broadly. Why do you view it through the lens of energy primarily? Well, first of all, the energy crisis is a direct consequence of Russia's aggression on Ukraine, right? And so, which has led to lower growth and more prices rising everywhere. We see that even before the war, prices were starting to go up, so you're absolutely right about that. But clearly, inflation became a lot more pervasive, more entrenched, and also the pressures have intensified after the war. We have, I think, a very interesting estimation for a gas, which is trying to see whether this is mostly because of supply shock or it's mostly a demand shock. Well, if it started as a supply shock right now in many countries of the UECD, you can see that it really right now, it doesn't matter. It's demand and supply. In fact, in some countries like the U.K., demand factors are now having more and an impact than the supply factors. So right now, what we're talking about, very large inflation in many parts of the world, monetary policy has to continue to be decisive. It has to do what the monetary policy has to do in order to get out of this situation. I think we are starting to see some positive signs in some parts of the world. So of our, you say that you think that probably China's economy will recover next year, which might actually increase demand for certain goods, including energy. How will this factor into how much developed markets have to be hiking rates, have to be countering that increase in demand, the increase in momentum that we see heading over from the east? Well, what we highlight as well is that this inflation is having a tremendous impact on people's incomes. Right? If you all across the world, we have a dramatic picture on real wages. And all across the world, real wages are going down. And that's why we focus so much that right now, if you want to ease the pain, if you want to be as short as possible, it is absolutely essential that we continue to be determined in this fight against inflation. If the economy starts recovering as we expect in the second half of next year, then certainly this will give a bit more pressures on prices. But I think as long as monetary policy is doing what it's doing and remains steadily fast on fighting inflation, we'll be able to have lower inflation going forward. Elvaro, when Bloomberg surveillance visits you at Central Portugal for the ECB con FAB here next year, you're modeling out 6 percent global inflation. Every single central banker is going to say that's unacceptable. Do you perceive that as a stopping point or do you have a different statistic where we get to a vaunted 2 percent Taylor perfection? What do we do when we get inflation down to 6.8 or dare I say 5 percent? I think what matters right now is when we're going to have inflation picking and coming down steadily. And so the trend is going to be very important. I'll give a good example. Brazil, when they started, there was one of the first countries to face significant inflationary pressures. And there's central bank decided to hike interest rates very decisively for a few months. And now it's starting to pay off. I think the last reading we had also from the United States is positive. And so what we need to do around the world is exactly to assess the situation. Some countries have acted a lot more than others. But what matters right now is to get the situation which inflation picks and starts to come down durably. It has to be durably. It cannot be only one data point. And this is what we need to monitor. In our forecast, we forecast that basically inflation will start to pivot around a mid-next year and we'll continue to come down even though it will remain fairly high in some countries at the end of 23. I don't want to get in trouble, but I'm going to get in trouble with your academic.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1830,2022-11-22 11:39:03
19217," a mid-next year and will continue to come down, even though it will remain fairly high in some countries at the end of 23. I don't want to get you in trouble, but I'm going to get you in trouble. With your academics and particularly teaching at the University of British Columbia, how do you respond to a central banker gaining out a two-year recession as we got from the governor of the bank of England? Do you have a confidence in establishing a real GDP view out 24 months or dare I say 36 months? Well, listen, all these forecasts, you know, and I know that all these forecasts are our best scenario, our what do we expect things will evolve, things change, nobody expected a pandemic three years ago, nobody expected a war just a few months ago. So things change. What I can tell you is that our forecasts, given what we know today, what we see in the data, we fear we are fairly confident about our central forecast right now. But risks, as I said before, are rising, and so risks that think and go wrong are there. But right now our central scenario is not a recession, sluggish growth, but not a recession. This has been wonderful. Dr. Perrier, thank you so much for joining us. Our prayer at the OECD with a really important summary and we give this great focus, folks, because they've been so out front on the vector. And it's all these institutions, and you know, I go back to the world trade organization where you wouldn't expect this analysis, and they were really leading on global slowdown, maybe with a Pacific Rim view, and you get the same thing from OECD. And it really highlights the uncertainty around inflation, right, is it demand-driven, is it supply-driven, is it a bit of both, how do you understand what happens when trying to come back offline, and how that effectors in? You know, people take shots at them, constantly the pinnata known as Lauren Summers, and the bottom line is, this is a stagflation analysis. Out two years, you've got nominal GDP of, let's round it up and be optimistic. Three plus six is 9% nominal GDP a year from now. No, I don't see anybody modeling that out. What's the counter impulse? Do you see fiscal spending? Do you see a monetary easing? Well, that's, yeah. At what point do we see some sort of response? And if we don't, then we, because we've not seen this. There's really, really good that you bring this up. It's well said, Lisa. And the answer here is Fokerts Landau of Deutsche Bank. In February, I guess it's this year, I can't, no, I'm two years ago, I can't remember now. But in February, Fokerts Landau was on the show, and he said, you've got to see fiscal spending because of a war in Europe. And, you know, have we really seen that yet? I'm not sure we've seen that fiscal stimulus. Well, we've seen it in Germany, and then there's been a lot of pushback elsewhere, simply because of, you know, just the concern about inflation, the concern that they're not allowing them to spend as well. I see you distracted. Now, honestly, I have to be honest, it's a really good game. I was actually looking at it the break. And it is, she picks up my phone and, you know, I mean, we go from Saudi, in the 76 minute, Saudi is upsetting Argentina, two to one. Argentina is with some huge efforts here, but that gets to Jens Nordwigs Denmark and Tunisia. And, you know, they're sort of like this basic Western world layup, odd Denmark layup. Well, it says, ooh, yeah, exactly. So, Lionel Messi, sword, a score to goal in the 10th minute, and then the Saudi Arabian goal. The second one was amazing. I'm really impressed. Pharaoh's probably watching this in a hotel room, goa, tearing up. Yeah, he's probably like, thank God, Lix, it was football top. No, he's actually crying for another reason. When he hears being talked about football, it is notable though to see these underdogs come out. No, it's notable that on global television, for global Wall Street, two people completely unqualified.

Austin met with his Chinese counterpart in Cambodia. Their first face-to-face meeting since House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan in August. It's the latest effort to put the U.S.-China relationship on a more stable footing. The European Union's executive is designing an emergency natural gas price cap. Now it's trying to avoid the kind of record high seen in August without risking the security of supplies.

What do you think of when you think of a battery? For most, it's what we use to power devices for both work and play, and maybe even your car. Over the past few decades, they've gotten way more powerful, long-lasting and affordable. But all of this is just a prologue to what the next batteries are going to do. As we drive to an increasingly renewable power-driven grid, we also need to be able to store energy and release it later to cover those periods of weather intermittencies that are driving this new grid that we're in. It's a multi-trillion dollar opportunity, and it's imperative that we figure out the solution here. How we store energy on a massive scale is in many ways the central challenge of the fight to stop climate change.

Balance of power weekdays on Bloomberg. When you think space you probably think, one space agency that travels under the radar is ESA, which is surprising considering what the European space agency has achieved and how vital it is to the global space industry. We've collaborated with pretty much everybody who is involved in space exploration. But ESA wants to be a leading force in furthering humanity's mission into space. If we want to have a successful human missions to Mars, we are going to have to learn to live a work off world in a different way. The place where we are going to learn to do that is on the move. And ESA help humanity take its next giant leap. As we work to bring policy to what we call a sufficiently restrictive stance, which really in simple terms means the level required to bring inflation down and restore price stability, we will need to be mindful. Continuing to little will leave inflation too high. And adjusting too much could lead to an unnecessarily painful downturn. Mary Daly of San Francisco can't say enough about it there with some real tourist comments here about the social consequences of how the Fed dances to December 14th and in the next year as well. It is the Tuesday before Thanksgiving. We're not struggling for news flow and the news flow today is really about Bitcoin, the weight on Genesis, I thought was wonderful here. Half an hour ago, 15,700 on Bitcoin. I usually don't quote that but today it is front and center, a chair into the markets, in equities, a chair into the market. Bonds yields come in a little bit after the quiet of yesterday. Oil with a lift here will get to that in a moment. Brent crude 88, 59 dashes. Again, the 90, I'm struggling here Lisa. What I'm not struggling with is to understand food because Javier Bloss has done terrific work at Bloomberg that core commodities really aren't up all that much. And yet Lisa and I know that when I'm preparing to do stuffing in aisle seven at the store that it's really expensive and you did the work on this as well. Hold on a second, just surveillance correction. You're not preparing to make stuffing. You haven't prepared to make stuffing for the past two decades. But we will pretend that we are both trying to cook. I can't cook either. Let's be honest. But for those who do my stuffing tastes like diesel fuel, which is what this is really about. Isn't it? Well, that's exactly right. Diesel fuel also in short supply stuffing mix year over year, increased 69%. Everything having to do with wheat is more expensive. And if you take a look at the farm bureau, they did a study and it shows that Thanksgiving dinner is up 20% year over year, which raises a question of how much further it can go, how sustainable this is and why? I think that's the point, Kona hack covering all things having to do with Thanksgiving dinner, perhaps she makes stuffing better than I do because I cannot make stuffing. Head of research at EDNF, man, Kona, what's behind this incredible lift across the board of food prices, particularly what it has to do with wheat? Yeah. I think it does boil down to the Ukraine invasion. We do know that the Black Sea, which is essentially Ukraine and Russia, they account for quarter of all your wheat exports globally. So the fact that for a long time, the beginning of this year, export out of this region was blocked, that caused havoc, absolute havoc. And it came at a time when there was dry weather issues in other key wheat producing regions around the world. You name it, you know, there was Europe, there was parts of the US. So I think we had a big shortage and globally stocks were at levels, but you haven't seen for a long time. It was very uncomfortable. So I think you're just seeing that rubber bidding.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1833,2022-11-22 11:52:05
19220," So I think we had a big shortage and globally stocks were at levels we hadn't seen for a long time. It was very uncomfortable. So I think you're just seeing that reverberating across, you know, commodities across the food chain have been very, very tight and on top of that the cost of shipping that stuff, the freight has been extortion at two. So it's all leading to the food basket, which is ultimately today so much more expensive for the average shopper. In time, I was talking about diesel and how that really is behind this and that really speaks to the shipping story, the idea that even transporting the food is getting more expensive. Are there any signs of disinflation of some sort of relieving of this pressure in the near future, or is it more of the same and even than some? So diesel is absolutely critically tied right now. I think in Russia, it's a massive exporter of diesel to Europe and this seems to be critically low levels of diesel stocks around the world, but just going back to the food itself. What I would notice is that the United Nations FAO Food Price Index that actually peaked in March. Yes, it was at record high levels at that point in March 2023, but since then, it has been steadily coming off. Now, that's the absolute futures price level when prices are at those highs. It takes a time for it to filter down to the supply chain and ultimately to the retailer. So that's going to take a while to filter through, but I would say prices have peaked. One thing about agricultural commodities is that farmers are very responsive. So when you do see high-weat prices, farmers will do everything to plant more of that crop. As long as water is permitting, they will plant more of that as soon as the next harvest. It can't have been dying to talk to you, and this is the global reach of ED and F-man. And that is if China extricates itself from its misery and we get a Pacific Rim restart or dare I say boom, what does that do to the Kona Hake world? So that is the big, big story, if you like, that commodities are desperate to look forward to. It really will have an impact. And every time when rumors were coming out, that China's about to lift its COVID-0 policy or even going somewhere towards addressing some of that, commodities have been rallying. So it really is the one thing that can really help things take off. I don't think that's going to happen until Q2 of 2023 at the earliest. And we've seen actually a next financial increase in cases most recently. So that's cause-causing short-term damage. But yeah, the hope that they will eventually open up, we'll see what we saw in Europe and America where pent up demand for going out, eating out restaurants, things that you couldn't do in lockdown. We'll definitely see a short-term bounce. But you have to remember one thing about China. The structural story is that China is no longer as commodity-intensive and hungry as he was, say a decade ago. So the drive will not be as extensive. There will certainly be a short-term balance, and that'll be very beneficial, but it will not be long-lasting, unfortunately. Kona Hake, thank you so much. Greatly appreciate this morning with ED and FMA. I want to squeeze one more question. They're always informative, but we just can't do it this morning. Just really interesting there in food. You know, we make jokes about this, but this is real hardship. I mean, I look, I remember I did a whole thing on rice for Bloomberg on the economy, Lisa years ago, and it was the cost of food in America. I can't remember what the number is, 8, 9, 10 percent. And in Cambodia, the cost of food is 60 and 70 percent of the paycheck. We make jokes about it, but even in America, the percentage of people flat on their backs from this food inflation is arguably to me bigger than the gallon of gas inflation that's out there. And you're seeing that in terms of discretionary spending and in terms of consumer sentiment, how much that's deteriorating into the winter months. I do wonder when you talk about whether this is a supply side-driven or demand-driven inflation, what rate hikes are going to do, right? I mean, this is the question, if we don't necessarily get some sort of increase in the production of oil, what does rate hikes do other than make it more difficult for people who are at the lowest deciles of their income sphere to be able to afford it? I don't know. These are some of the things that I expect that we keep, we'll keep hearing from Fed officials. And we heard also overnight from ECB members as well. Well, I like what Murray Daily said, and she's always had a real focus on the broader America as of all the other Fed officials. And if you want to see in Turkey, what's a butterball cost at the store? I don't even know.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1834,2022-11-22 11:56:23
19221," like what Mary daily said and she's always had a real focus on the broader America as of all the other fed officials. And if you want to see it in Turkey, why don't what's a butterball cost at the store? I don't even know. I just know that I give you the statistics from Farm Bureau because that's what's up in front of me right now. Turkey is $28.96 for a 16 pound Turkey. It would increase of 21% year over year. Deartigan, which is just phenomenal like fancy, fancy Turkey stuff. It's the wild turkeys $95.99 for one bird. And that's a sprawl of America. We spend too much time talking to people spending 70 bucks on a beast. And there's a whole bunch of people out there looking at 30, you said? Well, but how many of the people who previously were looking at 70 are going to 30, which is to reason my Walmart, perhaps, gain share with people, perhaps migrating lower in terms of the price savings? Just in, Pharaoh cooking for Thanksgiving. Can you see? Yeah, can you see him that guy? I can see John, you know, basting the beast. Lemon gelato for dessert. Actually, that would be good. Yes. That would be better than what I'm going to do. Bitcoin up. I'm going to survive Bitcoin. This is Bloomberg. Good morning. The mountain. I don't know. If NAC was started under President Clinton and Bob Rubin was the first person to hold that job, can you explain to people what it actually does and what the NAC does day to day, for example, who's in the NAC, who's on the NAC, what is your job actually to do? So the National Economic Council, the job, the mandate, the mission of the organization, is to coordinate economic policy across the executive branch and across the cabinet to make sure that the president is getting the benefit of when making decisions of his entire economic cabinet and also that the economic cabinet is getting clear direction from the president as well, so that two ways. So it's a coordination function on the NAC itself are all of the relevant cabinet members, the core economic team, OMB, Council of Economic Advisors, Treasury, but also Secretary of Labor, Secretary of Commerce. My team, the NAC team is a small team within the White House that is our job is to do that coordination across the range of economic policies. Now you were the deputy in the Obama administration at the NAC, now you're the director, which NAC worked better, the Obama administration one or the Biden one? Well on the issues that I worked on in the Obama administration, it worked very, very well and the current NAC works very well as well. There's this downside of where we are, but there's also this incredible upside. People are chasing fusion, they're chasing green, blue hydrogen, they're chasing battery storage, something's going to break through.

There's a lot of ground to cover. Come on, these guys absolutely crushed! We'll show you what's happening in ETFs like no one else. Bloomberg ETF IQ. Monday on Bloomberg. We're going through an inflection point right now. Like we saw earlier this summer. The economy is rolling over. The data is rolling over. And as hawkish as the Fed wants to talk, the markets are starting not to listen to it. We don't really know how far and how fast inflation before. A lot depends on what the Fed does. If the Fed slows down their very rapid rate of increase, will that allow us to avoid a recession? We're still going to get a recession at some point, although maybe not right away. This is Bloomberg's surveillance with Tom Keane, Jonathan Farrow, and Lisa Abranoids. Good morning, everyone. Jonathan Farrow, Lisa Bramson, Tom Keane, on a Tuesday before Thanksgiving. Yes, it is quieter, but it is not. In this hour, in moments, what do you do for 2023? We'll dive into that with a cautious view with Wells Fargo. John Farrell on assignment right now with Argentina, stunningly on the edge of losing the Saudi Arabia. Mr. Farrell report on that, too, is our inner messaging system as well. Lisa, all the news today, it's really sort of comforting to get back with Tracey Macmillian back to like, what do we do for 2023? Away from Disney blowing up or Bitcoin blowing up? Well, the problem is, is that we have to get through Bitcoin blowing up or Disney having a huge management shift. In order to get 2023 and nobody can really game out how that's going to go. I mean, the one consensus that you're feeling in 2023 is, and I love how George Zervell has put this yesterday. It's unlikely that so many bad things could happen all at once the way that it did in 2022. And what's interesting here is that the rare optimistic call, there are people out there looking for a constructive 2023, but just up against OECD this morning, folks, and all you need to know is the migration on real GDP growth is a bank of England like. And the migration of inflation doesn't get it done down to 6.8% global inflation. Next year, all of a sudden you and I are looking out to 2025. Yeah, hiking into weakness, saying that there's a need to really keep hiking in order to crimp some of the demand and get inflation down. You're talking about bears, right? I'm going to throw out one that's sort of notable. Marco Kalenevich over at JP Morgan. Almost full capitulation here, basically saying that the only way to have a sustained rally and asset prices is for the Fed to start cutting rates. And he doesn't see that happening in the near term. This is somebody who has been a permable for so much of the cycle basically coming out and saying, eh, I'm done. It doesn't seem like it's in the cards right now. Well, we're going to see that. We're going to see a lot of 2023 resets. We're going to do that with Wells Fargo here in a moment. But my reset is just this mass uncertainty. Let's talk about Bitcoin this morning. This is the lead story this morning, advanced by Lydia Bayou and Sunali Bassack and company at Bloomberg. On Genesis, Genesis is not FDX, right? It's considered to be perhaps a little bit more with respect to institutional money. It's the Winkel Voss twins. It's a lot of people who thought of this as much more stable. Stable coin. I love it. Look at this. It's almost like we're on the same page. I have no idea what stable coin is. Well, I can, well, we can discuss that another time. There is a bigger question here, which is, where are we in the fallout of the crypto turmoil? Just Sunali Bassack saying we're in the middle of it. How much more do we have to see in how much is this a symptom of what we've seen in terms of the withdrawal of easy money? Stay with us through the day. And I believe, correct me wrong, Amy, on this if I am wrong. But we have crypto this afternoon, where we'll really dive into this with a complete effort. We're going to look forward to that. She says your correct. I'm going to go to television this morning. I correct. She talks to you. She doesn't talk to me. What can I say? Fugus is up for it. Fugus is up 44. Abonds. There's a movement today. After yesterday's quiet, you know, it's coming in a little bit. 5%. We're looking for the two year yield to get out there.

And the real yield in a little bit 1.46% on the real yield oil with a lift 8871 on European Brent crude global Brent crude back towards $90 and dollar churning today is not much of a story. I demand a pre Thanksgiving brief. Right. Lisa Brant. Fine. If you insist. Let's talk about what we're looking at today, including a slew of earnings. We already got some of them, including Burlington stores, exporting goods coming out dollar tree is what I am watching. How much do you see an ongoing flight to some of these discounters because of this feeling that people want to downshift, given the fact that dollar tree is up more than 24% so far this year. Just this is the winners that tend to merge during downturns or soft patches in the economy today. The Fed speak includes Cleveland Fed president, Laura domestic city fed president Esther George and say Lewis fed president and Bollard, do we get a shift in tone? Do you start to hear about concerns about the lag of facts and that's something that sort of people touch on. Unless I already talk about this, you keep this up on television and radio. We're looking at the three mugs of Mr. George and Bollard and this is the strength of the Federal Reserve system. When Donna Madison Avenue, the country went broken to 1907. And in 19 I think it was 12 we started the Fed Reserve modernized in 1951 and the heart of it is the regional presidents are different and independent. And what I love about what you're saying, Lisa, these are three starkly different voices today. And the one consistency is inflation is the first and foremost concern and that rates are going to go higher before they hold hold put. At one P.m. we get an auction. US is playing the South 35 billion dollars of seven year notes. These tend to be difficult auctions because they are less liquid than other parts of the curve. The yields are higher 3.89%. What is the demand like? I mean, just gives you a sense of where we have been considering the fact that we were near zero and not so long ago going up almost four percentage points is sort of shocking. And now the dumb question of the day is there tax law selling in bonds? Not the same, not to the same degree as stocks. So it's not going to be affected in that kind of manner especially because there's a huge international investment. We do lots of fancy stuff here. inequities bonds currencies, commodities, but part of it is get back to basics. Tracy Mcmillian is in charge of basics at Wells Fargo Investment Institute is head of global asset allocation strategy. Tracy, let's get out front of your view next year. What do you see for use of cash in 2023? Sure. So good morning, Tom. And thank you for having me. So for 2023, we're actually seeing equity markets move higher, but it's going to be a really tricky path to get there because the Fed is likely to be under three different regimes. As we move into 2023, we start the year with them continuing to tighten. Then we think we're going to see a pause. And then we think by the end of the year, they're going to be cutting rates as we move through a moderate recession. So think the markets are going to be looking out to 2024 by that point. And we see about 10% upside from here. So we would cautiously be dollar cost averaging into equities. We're also starting to take a little bit of risk and fixed income by moving out in duration. Tracy, how much help concern do your clients right now? How much fear is there? So there's some fear, but I would say with relation to other downturns, the 2008, 2009 financial crisis, even the pandemic, we're not seeing the same level of fear at this point. Now that doesn't mean we won't see that eventual fear and capitulation that we do tend to see during bear markets. But this has been a really well-tellent-gruff bear market. And it's been very orderly so far. So we really haven't seen that kind of fear from our clients that we typically see during the bear market. We're going to hear from a host of Fed speakers. Later this month, we are going to hear from Fed Chair Jay Powell, believe on November 30th, at a Brookings conference. What are you looking for to understand what the pivot point will be in terms of not just pausing rates, but actually starting to cut?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1837,2022-11-22 12:09:21
19224," conference. What are you looking for to understand what the pivot point will be in terms of not just pausing rates, but actually starting to cut? Sure. So what we're looking for is inflation to start to come off the boil and we're starting to see that with the latest inflation data. We're starting to see it in goods data, maybe not so much at least it from the CPI in terms of services and that that's the services inflation to really beholden to this tight labor market. So we're watching the same things, the Fed is watching. We're watching inflation data and we're watching the labor market data and it's really going to take both of those cooling before we think the Fed will start to cut rates again. Tracey Grillian, thank you so much for the Wells Fargo. Greatly appreciate it this morning. It's the, like the stories for 2023 and I'm going to give John Major credit on this and then I think it was three years ago where John coined the idea that the outlook for a given year starts in March because there's so there's just so much uncertainty. But all the confidence has gone. But how much is it reset in March then reset again in June, then reset again in September? It's pretty pandemic. But this is pretty pandemic that he, that I mean, I remember, you know, I can't remember the answer because we believe. No, boy, there was always with his voice, someone with a bow tie. Okay, it's we would suggest. It's a problem because the market tries to get ahead of everything. So they try to game out the entire year. That's the first game. And then you have to reset and go to the next year that's jammed into another couple months. I would suggest what we haven't talked enough about and I give the whole show our team and everyone credit for this lease is your world. When we when we cavalierly say bonds are down 15% in price, you can use the word never. We've never seen this and grizzled veterans who remember 78, 79. That was a walk in the park compared to the rationalizations at 1231, 22 that are going to be made among old and quiet. It's been the worst year on record for benchmark treasures. This is the way of saying it. I mean, when you take a look at benchmark bond indexes and see them in a bear market, this is unheard of, right? And so this is the reason why sometimes you're a bit skeptical of the incredible optimism that people have about bonds next year. They say, well, this is the time to buy. It's a great time for bonds and you're like, really, you guys just suffered the worst losses ever in your existence. How much though have we seen the fallout from this? And this is what when you say my world, is it possible to have the benchmark full faith and credit safest instrument, get totally blown out and not see anything blow up? The great David Goldman, who was at Bank of America, wrote a chapter in my book years ago, precisely on this and that the mistake is to watch the doom and gloom trunches in Margie Patel yesterday agreed with Mr. Goldman that you watch quality out there to see what it does. The quality is pulled back 15% and you see if that recovers here. There's a bet on it, when you say there are a lot of people are betting on that pretty vociferously saying that next year is going to be the best year for a long time. Well, we've heard that before.

The two-year deal includes a base salary of 1 million and a bonus equal to that amount, as well as stock awards with a target value of 25 million each year. The amount is actually lower than past packages. Former CEO Bob J. Beck received $32.5 million in fiscal 2021, and Eiger, who was chairman at the time, received just over 45 million. The richest person in the world has seen his fortune declined by more than $100 billion this year. According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Elon Musk's wealth has fallen to a little less than $170 billion. After Monday's $8.6 billion loss, his stake in electric carmaker Tesla comprises the bulk of Musk's fortune. Those shares have fallen about 52 percent this year. Global news 24 hours a day on air and on Bloomberg Quick Take. I'm Lisa Mateo. This is Bloomberg. Today, what are the biggest challenges for General Dynamics and what are the biggest opportunities? So I think in any business, the challenges are solving complex problems that come to you. You know, the problems that come to me and my senior leadership team for resolving tend to be highly complex and troublesome. So your ability to solve those complex problems is an important element, I think, of the value that we add to the company. And then I think opportunities, you always want to make sure that you've got a creative enough mind and open enough mind to be able to see around square corners. What am I missing? You know, the why questions are really powerful. Why are we not doing this? So why are we doing this? I ask those questions a lot. And in the answers, you can sometimes tease out some real opportunities, some hidden things. But thinking creatively about opportunities and problems is really important. And what about the industry generally? I think they have big challenges now as the defense budget probably comes down a bit. So I think that we are all responsible and we have an obligation to find the latest and best technologies that we can for our customers and deliver them in the most cost-effective manner we can. And I think that that's a challenge and an opportunity for all of the big defense companies. You've got to explain this one to me. What does it mean when the White House says we're watching markets carefully? It means they have a Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. They have. I've been in and seen it. Lots of Bloombergs.

Richard Haas of the Council on Foreign Relations just brilliant yesterday on the linkage of our diplomacy, our foreign policy, with our domestic policy in the uncertainties moving forward. Lisa Braminson, Tom Keane with you, John Farrell, on assignment, Denmark, Tunisia coming up, is well, futures of eight, down futures of 68. I'm going to call it just like stocks are open today, futures are open, we'll see what happens. Yeels come in a little bit, and Lisa, that sort of the growth thanks that's out there. Yeah, and this concern about how far the Fed can go. Can I just say, you keep trolling, John, you basically keep implying that he's like, just ditched us to go watch the World Cup. So we'll find out. Hopefully he'll come back and give us a full report. I'm more intelligent report than we'll ever do. We know that. 100 percent. Sure, and I like to say that my bracket has completely blown up with Argentina losing. It's sort of like, you know, March madness. I'm sort of out of it like immediately. The 64. And that he's been so loyal and the current joins us now, Chief Asia economics correspondent. And I'm as guilty of this as anybody. I say, I've been to China. And I've been from the airport in Hong Kong to the Mandarin, or, you know, maybe some fancy bun hotel in Shanghai in China right now. It's getting serious. Chongqing is in Sichuan. It's 800 miles from Hong Kong. It is one of the four city states of the People's Republic of China. Tell us about the quality of the COVID lockdown. We see an inner China this morning. Well, look, it's getting worse by today. Tom China's COVID cases are surging. We had a top health official Sun Shanlan. She went to Chongqing today. She's the kind of Chinese equivalent, Dr. Fauci. Now, what the authorities are trying to do is they're trying to thread this needle up about not enforcing mass widespread lockdowns that we saw saying Shanghai earlier in the year, but they're trying to do more targeted restrictions on the ground. It's not just Chongqing, also, Pesata, Skiing Hong Kong, Guangzhou is the other representative of this outbreak. But obviously the question is asking that the officials are obviously asking is how are they going to do that? How can they control this outbreak without going to kind of draconian measures? So, Nemora reckons around a fifth of China's economic output is now being hammered by the latest COVID restrictions and COVID testing that's going on. So it's all heading the wrong direction for COVID-0. Over the last 50 years, the city's state reality of China is it the mayors, the leaders, the generals, if you will, of each given city have a voice and they're very powerful. And they've been quieted by President Xi, or can they give him an urgent response to hey, this is what, excuse me, is happening in our city. Well, there was a recent plan, delegating more kind of authority to the local level authorities told you, a point allowing them to respond to COVID as they best see fit. But of course, the instruction was also you're not too live flat and they have to continue to control the virus. So obviously our own colleagues in Beijing and Shanghai are reporting the question becomes how can they pull that off? How can they allow the economy to",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1840,2022-11-22 12:22:20
19227," I flat and they have to continue to control the virus. So obviously our own colleagues in Beijing and Shanghai are reporting the question becomes how can they pull that off? How can they allow the economy to breathe while also controlling the virus without kind of draconian restrictions that are being forced through? So this is the big dilemma. I think there is a feeling among China watchers that China is heading into a very difficult few weeks. It's going to be probably the biggest test of COVID-19 since the pandemic began. And more also out today make the point that China's hospital network in terms of ICU beds and the like isn't as good as your Taiwan's or South Korea is in Japan. So it is real, a real critical a couple of weeks now facing China on this policy. And I hear in the US there also is a bit of a COVID wave, although there's enough immunity that people kind of shrug it off. And I do wonder, you know, as people gather for Thanksgiving meals and prioritize getting together regardless of any health concerns, what the social unrest is like the social pushback in China amid another round of shutdowns. Well, again, as you well know, it's hard to be too scientific, but open source social media does suggest there's a lot now of fatigue, exhaustion and maybe resentment towards the ongoing COVID-19 restrictions. We had some analysts on Bloomberg TV today and Asia hours making the point that people are fairly tired by the ongoing restrictions as it is. That's obviously understandable, but the whole crux of the issue is how does China navigate away from COVID-0 without having a fairly serious public health disaster on its hands? And that's the big challenging act here. How can they navigate to get the vaccination rates to where it should be, either with Chinese made vaccines or Western made vaccines? And then how can they, of course, keep the economy ticking over when you have an exit wave from COVID-0? And other countries in Asia who come out of COVID-0 went through a pretty rough time when we're pulling out of it in terms of work or shortages, supply chain disruptions and everything else. So, it's not going to be simple for China. A lot of economists today, Golden Sachs, include who are making the point that it's going to be a very slow, torturous process for how do you navigate out of this? That said, almost everyone who I've read believes that China will make its way out of this next year. This is the consensus trade that you will see outperformance in the world's second biggest economy because of how low things have been this year and because they have to start the process. Can you connect the dots and all the things that have to go right to get there to make sense of this consensus call? Yeah, it's because expectations have been so low, Lisa. It's probably not too hard to see how China could at least recover somewhat from here. As you mentioned, if they can navigate out of COVID-0 in a somewhat controlled fashion, obviously the consumer will be ready to go, pent up demand, just like we've seen in every other country around the world. Golden Sachs, thinking that will happen in the second half of next year. But don't forget to real estate side of it, real estate slump, accounting for almost a quarter of economic activity. As we've said before, economists say that the recent measures to shore up the real estate sector are game changer. So there is a scenario where we could get into, say, mid next year where maybe China's navigating the COVID side of things better than the husband, maybe the real estate sector has found its feet and China's getting up and running again. And thank you so much for your work each evening for us from China and the current running on all of our economic analysis from Hong Kong on the Pacific Rim. I want to do a victory lap for one, El Abramow. It's Abramow killing it yesterday in the equity watch, a rare and difficult thing for her. Your interview with one Peter Oppenheimer really got some major traction out in the media. People talked about it as well. Ian Lincoln and Bonz published this moments ago, a plethora of unknowns is what Ian Lincoln sees. And Oppenheimer sort of said the same thing in the equity space, right? Which is a reason why they say kind of meandering performance for a while, but the meandering performance ends up leading to something where there are new highs later on in the existence of the stock market, which is not next year. Does he participate in the market now or is Goldman Sachs London in cash? Participate in the market. It seems like there are pockets of opportunity. This is the consensus also, right? It's sort of where is the leadership going to go? There's still areas that could have performed stockpicking. It's not necessarily going to be a wholesale kind of catastrophic moment. He also pushed back against the Mike Wilson view that we could see 3000 on the S&P.

Something's going to break through. Bloomberg, your global business authority. Good morning everyone. Bloomberg, Savannah, Sleesa, Brahmins and Tom Keith. Children, you were this year on an eventful Tuesday. Sean Ali, Vastek, Schedule to be with us. I believe in the next hour she and her team are working with Lydia Bayoude here on an important story. I'm Bitcoin, I'm Genesis. We're watching that very carefully. Bitcoin, I'm going to say, and I'm speaking as an amateur, ugly 18 hours, comes back nicely 15,800 on Bitcoin now up 120 points. John Farrell is on assignment here. And Lisa, we're, I think we're 30 minutes away from another game. Thanks. So people will be watching that one. And the last one was really good, actually, I was looking at some of my. It was amazing. And it went for like a hundred or one minutes or something because they get hurt and they keep, they have to play 90 minutes. I think that's the rule. So they play out longer. I think John actually took off specifically. So we did not have to hear us talking about the World Cup. I think he could just, you know, focus on the game and people who know better than us. I'll give you a sense of what I'm watching today, just in terms of some specific companies and the earnings role that has been going on best by coming out with better than expected earnings sort of shocking because it was all online. And now people are coming back to the stores to buy tech to buy other things. They actually reinstated a dividend. They increased their dividend. And they talked about operating income, meaning that it will be slightly higher than expected for the current fiscal year. You're seeing those shares more than 7% zoom shares down sharply after disappointing earnings yesterday. They reported their slowest quarterly sales growth on record. They also cut their full year forecast. Which really goes to the whole, are we post pandemic? Are we ever going back to zoom? You never were on zoom. I thought it was such a high point. They have Dana Telsi with us, but you follow this more than me. It's highly idiosyncratic. Am I right about there wrong? It is, you mean in terms of the tech story? Retail, not the retail, just the whole tech retail thing. It's just stocked my stock right now. It seems to. It's about inventories and what people have done. It's about the mix of customer. It's about the type of product. The one unifying feature is that the discount stores have done well. We see that with TJ Maxx, TJ Maxx, and we've also seen online not fear as well. Amazon not doing as well. Even Walmart, the online sales didn't do as well. It is in store purchases that people are really good. You have the thing where you're in your living room and you go Athena or whatever is Amazon Lexa. All Pharaoh. What's it called? Alexia? Alexa. Alexa. Alexa, what did the seven year auction do? Right? They're going to get rid of it all. That's the right thing. Okay. And so, what do you do? I do. You really have one. I genuinely have it. We've already gone over this. I occasionally ask it to tell jokes to my children. So I don't have to. Are you serious? Engage. Oh, the other stock I was going to look at was Dell technology is not to shift the topic. Dell technology shares. What did I have? Alexa or that I've asked you for jokes? Their jokes are actually so bad. They're funny. Here's a grandma with grandma in the living room. What's it called? Alexia? That's the rumor. What? They're going to eliminate Alexa or what else? They're eliminating a lot of the staff tied some of these issues. I don't know that they're going to eliminate that. But I will just say Dell is slightly lower after cutting their revenue. Is there other stuff coming out today? I mean, everybody's racing into Thanksgiving. I guess it's, you know, you mean the earnings? Yeah, there's some earnings coming out. Okay. We'll very good for them before. Future's advance up 11 off that data check. There's no question about that. Now Future's up 80 points. We did that for Faro. As well, in the spirit of Denmark, Tunisia, we had Jens Nordwig with us of Denmark. Of course, all of his good work and foreign exchange. And we now go broader to the Baltic Sea and East to Anders Pearson, chief executive officer for global fixing. Come, we make notes Sweden is not in the world cup, but then he will nod to Denmark here in a moment. What is it like? Anders, explain to our American audience, particularly those that are not in the soccer. You don't make it. Italy didn't make it. Sweden didn't make it. Is that a big deal actually? It's a big deal. Yeah. I mean, I think any European country, but probably any country, maybe outside the US when the country does not make it to the world cup, it's a deal. And we have to quickly.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1843,2022-11-22 12:35:38
19230," Yeah, I think you're a peon country, but probably any country, maybe outside of the US when the country does not make it to the World Cup, it's a deal. And we have to quickly figure out what other country you're going to start sharing for ourselves. That's like the heritage of the naturally, you know, of course, champion for United States, but Denmark is my second go to here. And that was Sweden didn't make it. Well, the heritage in the V and that's really important because of his Chicago, the Chicago Cubs didn't make it for decades. It's good to see as well. What is the 2023 view you have? Can you acquire bonds here for higher bond prices, lower yields? Yeah, we are we are becoming increasingly more constructed on the bond markets here as we're moving into 2023. I think we're, our view is that the market is pricing in more and more of uncertainty here and more broadly, kind of the volatility uncertainty. We do expect to continue for the rest of the year, but as we move into 2023, when the Fed hopefully starts kind of slowing down their hiking, hopefully maybe wrapping it up, we do think that that's that's going to be a good time to really start legging in further into the broad of fixed income markets. I think the spread widening could start a little bit here and we could retest some of the why it's perhaps, but the yield levels are very interesting, the income opportunities are very, very real. So while we're little cautious in the air term, we're really focusing on that income generation part of fixed income. The vast majority of fixed income returns comes from income. As you guys know, not capital appreciations, when you can have these entry levels for investment great corporates at close to 5%, high yield at close to 9%, it's starting to become very interesting. And we actually think it's a bit of a sweet spot from a broader asset allocation compared to equities compared to some other options as well. A lot of people would agree with you, Anders, and I want to go broad and I want to sort of get existential because it's a ahead of the Thanksgiving dinner and I want to board my kids with some bond existential reality. And there really is this issue where the Fed raised rates far beyond what anyone had expected. It didn't cause a massive blow up. It didn't cause a massive cascade of defaults, like so many people had thought. And now we're talking to some people about potentially the best investing experience ahead that they could imagine in bonds. Can you square that? How the Fed could raise rates so much and not cause some real damage to a corporate debt sphere that blew up over the past two decades? Yeah, I mean, I think I don't, I would say we can't count on that complete figure's jet. As we're sitting here today, today, yes, that's certainly is the case in bond markets and credit markets are holding up quite nicely. We still have the uncertainty of a Fed policy era. If they continue to be aggressive and too aggressive, that could change, it could change quite quickly. That's not our base case. We're expecting sort of a mild recession next year and we're expecting the credit market's going to hold up quite while, as I mentioned, we can see a little bit of spread widening potential here, but we're not expecting a total blowout. But yeah, I mean, it's these are unique times and unprecedented times. I know we keep going back to that. And I think that's the part that the market is trying to handicap how different is at this time and how we'll display out next year. But, you know, ultimately when we take a step back, we are finding the fundamentals are holding up okay. Obviously, there are deteriorating earnings are seeing some pressures you just touched on. Yeah, but it's not like things are falling off a cliff. And I think that's that's the comfort that we're seeing. That companies are coming into this prepare that pushed out the maturity wall. They are very focused on making sure that they're preparing for tougher times, which is unusual. Usually when you're facing a recession, it comes sort of out of nowhere. And that's the unique time that we're dealing with this. And there's how much is your bullishness hinge on there being some sort of recession next year. And I say this because if there's not, then the Fed's going to keep hiking rates and you're going to get that much more pressure on this space. How much are you counting on that? Yeah, we are counting on a mile recession next year. We don't think a soft landing. You know, it's not impossible, but I wouldn't call it at least my base case at this point. So there's going to be almost like the Goldilocks will be some very mild recession. The key",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1844,2022-11-22 12:39:42
19231," You know, almost like the Goldilocks will be some very mild recession that keeps the fed comfortable that they've done enough, particularly on inflation side. We sort of need to see the labor market having some cracks, not too much of a crack, but some clapper crack. And that would be sort of the best case scenario in my mind that we see a little bit of this low down inflation, or fair bit, let's call it, but quite a complete fall apart. That's very very quickly here. The foundation, the heritage of New Vienn is municipal bonds. Is there value now in municipal bonds versus taxables? Yeah, we're definitely finding a lot more opportunities on the Moody side at this point. It's been a very challenging year. Flows have been very negative, but we take a step back. Credit stats are very, very strong. Risk reward, we think, is increasingly attractive. And munis, we think, is a good risk reward all in all. It should perform quite well in a variety of scenarios, particularly in a sort of moderate recession next year. So, yes, overall we find good value in that space. Anders Pearson, thank you so much. I know I'll get you out here 20 minutes before the people to the West take on Tunisia. Anders Pearson, Sweden and New Vienn, thank you so much for joining us. This morning, Lisa, this conversation coming up, folks, we're self-ashonness. It's New York, it's on the edge of coal, it gets warmer the next couple days, but nobody has briefed us on New England, New York City, New York Harbor, hydrocarbons, like Stephen Shortk. And the fact that we really has been incredibly low inventories of diesel, which you've seen that disdivergence between diesel prices and gasoline prices. And how much that's going to become an issue heading into the winter. And this is about, it's not about folks, the war in Ukraine, Russia, Saudi Arabia, beating Argentina. It's about distillates and not on my backyard. Am I right on that? A big part of it. Yesterday was really interesting. Did you see the price action yesterday with the prices just plunging in the crude space and the Brents side of things falling below $85? A barrel for the first time in September on this Wall Street Journal report that OPEC Plus was considering increasing production, sort of a nod to the Biden administration. OPEC Plus came out denied it and now prices are flying upward. How much is that really the swing factor at a moment of real tenuousness about demand and supply? Come on, the swing factor to me is end of current reporting on Hong Kong on Chongqing. I hope I'm pronouncing that right. Excuse me if I did not seriously, 800 miles northwest to Hong Kong. To me, that has more to do with the oil noise and than anything else. Yeah, but this is all rumor and speculation. How do people get to send this? We do. I understand that, but my point is this is what people are trying to game out in some kind of material way. And there's no way. God, Lisa, that's the family secrets out. We were in a meeting, folks. This is like 18 years ago and they're like, Tom, we can't call the show Bloomberg Rumor Inspeculation. I think we should. All right. It was shortlisted, but it didn't make it there.

It's not the Wyoming way to sit around and wait for change. We want that independence, we want that freedom, we want that individuality. And that's a common theme that brings together bipartisan support for this in Wyoming. We want to make sure that people understand, especially in Wyoming, but as the United States as a whole, this trend is coming. It's not going to stop. This is more of a small town that's growing into what I would call the cryptocurrency version of Silicon Valley. It's the philosophy of that rugged individualism, the independence, and the ability to really get things done for yourself and control your own destiny.

19233," We also need to be able to store energy and release it later to cover those periods of weather intermittencies that are driving this new grid that we're in. It's a multi-trillion dollar opportunity and it's imperative that we figure out the solution here. How we store energy on a massive scale is in many ways the central challenge of the fight to stop climate change. We're not so negative about the downside. We just think there'll be more volatility in the trend towards a lower market level before we get that job. The reason we're not quite so negative is because there are some positives. We do think that the U.S. economy will avoid a hard landing. Peter Oppenheimer, Chief Global Equity Strategist, Goldman Sachs, and the interview with Lisa Abramboz with Worldwide Headlines yesterday, really, really interesting on his tenetiveness of getting into 2023. We're not going to waste any time here. John Farrell, Keith for Denmark, Tunisia, he is on assignment. We're unsure when Mr. Farrell will be returning. Abramow and I are here because we don't care. Here on a Tuesday with futures, up eight. Here's what you need to know. Zydeco Pipeline was a phenomenal song by Aaron Neville years ago. Daniel N. Watt produced it down in New Orleans and it is a key, key oil pipeline along the Gulf of Mexico. It is the focus now of our next guest. Steven Short is principal of narrowness and acuity on the hydrocarbon market. It's Short Group. Steven, let me summarize for our audience. We're up to our eyeballs in petroleum and the price is going to go down. Do I have that right? Well, in the near term, we certainly are a risk to the downside. So we had the market that switched into Contango. This is the NIMX WTI Crude Oil Market Contango meaning that the price this month is cheaper than the price next month. That occurred on yesterday's expiration in the December contract. Why are we in Contango? Well, simply because to your point, Zydeco Pipeline, which is a significant pipeline that takes oil from the shell patch in West Texas that's being produced, it takes it to the export market in Houston. Well, there's maintenance now that's going to last well into December on that pipeline. So your oil flows are lower, but you're still producing oil in West Texas. So if you can't move it into Houston, you have to put it somewhere and it's very important as far as the NIMX is concerned, because where that something is going to be is up at the NIMX terminal complex, up in question, Oklahoma. So we're looking at a situation where we're going to be building supplies at the NIMX terminal complex for the next weeks. The surprise to me, Steven, as an amateur, is West Texas Intermediate breaches $70. We get a 69 print on American oil. Is that in your realm of possibility? To me, yes, with regard to, now this was one of our more barrage cases. This is really at the tail end of our modeling of where we could go. Certainly, I do expect to see oil find a base here. Assuming we do not go into a significant recession and we have to keep in mind, this is the Biden putt, right? This is the level $70 oil in the low 70s that the White has said, this is the level. We're going to start buying oil to refill the SBR. So if you're sitting there, why would you sell $70 oil when the United States government is going to come in and start buying 200 million barrels at that price? So there in effect, without recession, is your floor in the market time? So what about the ceiling, right? Because we were talking about the tight market about, you know, two minutes ago, and we were talking about oil prices were going to rise beyond $120 a barrel on the certainly Brent and close to that on WTI. What's changed so materially in the physical market to make that completely an obsolete argument? You know, absolutely. So the $130, which is where we were in the first quarter of second quarter of last year, that's unattainable. That to say that we can get back up there, but we can't stay there because that's where we sell the demand destruction. So that is short of something catastrophic happening in the supply in the market. That market cannot go up and be on that. So what has changed now, of course, is the weakened in economies around the globe.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1847,2022-11-22 12:52:46
19234," Graphic happening in supply in the market that market cannot go up and beyond that. So what has changed now? Of course is the weakening economies around the globe. So it is a near-term bearish picture at this point as we said the Russians are Front running the price cap so they've dumped a lot of oil on the market. There are fine news in Europe Fearful of that price cap have bought all that oil. So you're having a hard time now selling physical oil So a lot of the physical oils getting rolled forward into the first quarter which is going to keep the market Supply in the fear now of course is COVID with China. When is that economy finally going to reopen? There is some optimism that can reopen fully by next summer, but there's still a lot of skepticism in that So without that demand in the market you've got this low scenario of oil prices I think in that low 70 low 80 I think this is the bottom of the market and therefore we're waiting for the demand because think about this CapEx is challenge Interest rates are are moving higher your hurdle rates for capEx are that much higher So you're still looking at a market that's going to be a dearth of capital Which is not going to go of course obviously into bringing more oil to the market So your long-term picture is still bullish that still gets you back to that $100 range But we just have to you know get over the short-term hurdles. Could you foresee a time where you see the price of gasoline go down and the price of diesel Stay high and even go higher Well, that that's the new dynamic that we're in Lisa because right here in my hometown Philadelphia They're the once great epicenter the East Coast refinery We lost 55% of our refinery capacity. So three years ago we had a refinery in South Philly that produced our Your process 330 thousand barrels of crude oil a day That was a lot of gasoline a lot of this the fuel that went right into our whole market here in Philly and then of course 90 miles after Jersey term pike into lending New Jersey in the New York Harbor market We no longer have that so that diesel fuel has to come from somewhere and keeping in mind that gasoline is your best margin for a Refinery so this is where they maximize so this is where you bring more gasoline to the market at the expense of Distill if you'll diesel fuel so now we have to yes, I'm sorry. I just this is so important socially Steven shark And you've been so dead on this if we affect a shortage of heating whatever fuel in New England in the greater North East How do you perceive a government response of this? I mean? What is the linkage of not in my backyard to government regulation Investments incentives to fix this problem? Well the short term fix is for for this winter is the Northeast Northeast heating oil reserve Which we have two million barrels of heating oil sitting in tank something Connecticut or not as a cheesets And you also have that for gasoline too So that isn't in fact and I'm surprised we haven't seen that yet because here in Philadelphia 45 minutes up the Northeast Extension Allentown was out of diesel they they'd close down one of their guest stations up there because they were out of diesel fuel So we are running shortages into this market Okay, but Steven I don't mean interrupt I was in Paris and on the way out to CDG There were lines lines lines. I've never seen waiting for a gallon of gas. Are you predicting that for allentown or for Albany New York? Well, certainly that that is the risk I think gasoline We're we're going to be you know what we'll get through this because that's where the price incentive is Both distal fuel diesel fuel We're already running shortages and that was shortages time before we even had any sort of heating demand in the market So we're looking at the Northeast the middle Atlantic New England markets that are 70% of the homes or market heat heats with heating oil So that that is an absolute risk that will continue all through the cold months Absolutely brilliant here the short report folks. I can't say enough about it. Yeah, I've got the emails No, we protect the copyright of all of our guests see Steven's shark of the short group for five pages every day of Shocking acuity on the hydrocarbon market Lisa. We come out of Paris. She go to North East It's it's like four in the morning or whatever we're getting united out and the lines I saw were different. They were all trucks It was all diesel lined up for miles at gas stations and we staked it off now But could you see that in a couple months time?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1848,2022-11-22 12:57:07
19235," It was all diesel lined up for miles at gas stations. And we saved it off now, but could you see that in a couple of months time? I was short saying it was possible, I guess, is how I would have framed that. It's possible futures advance, up nine points. Stay with us. This is Bloomberg. Music So as you look back on your career, what would you say is the best investment advice you've ever received? Probably the best investment advice that I never received, but that I've lived my whole life around, is to round yourself with really good people. I thought about it just today like I do many times, you know, what makes a great investor? A great investment firm is comprised of people who are optimists and pessimists and realists, because in the intersection of the debates that go across that wide range of personalities is where you find truth. It's part of the reason I'm so focused on freedom of expression. I see it my own four walls, the robust and fulsome debates around how we commit our capital, what defines a good idea, what businesses to build or pursue. That's what drives the success it's citadel. And I've been very fortunate in life to have always had a group of friends who really push me, who make me better. And here I get to work with three and a half thousand colleagues who in their ways make me better each and every day and collectively as a team, we've had the opportunity to have an incredible impact on the financial landscape around the world. 😈💕 Coming from the financial centers of the world subscribe to Green Bird's European Stars started London and Alex Dielin, New York, real-time numbers, real-time analysis, weekdays. Power, policy, politics, from the White House to the Hill, Bloomberg covers the leaders in legislation. That was really a tectonic shift for this White House. The theory of this bill, as I understand it, is there'll be a multiplier effect. How did Democrats mobilize specifically younger voters? Bringing you the political news you need to know. The president has made it very clear that this is a significant focus. For the intersection of Wall Street and Washington, nobody covers politics like Bloomberg.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1849,2022-11-22 13:01:26
19236," Nobody covers politics like Bloomberg. Stocks can still lag from here, and it's not going to express itself regardless what we're doing on the quantitative tightening in the bond market. I think we, just like the rest of the market, are looking for a pivot to the next big trend. 2022 was essentially one big trade. We're going to more for our concerns away from inflation. We're going to be thinking about the recession. I think 23 will probably be rather muted to a return year, but I still think that what he's going to do better than balance. This is Bloomberg's surveillance with Tom Keane, Jonathan Farrow and Lisa Abramowitz. Trading water to Turkey Day, World Cup in the background. Welcome back. This is Bloomberg's surveillance. Tom Keane, Jonathan Farrow, Lisa Abramowitz on this day with a holiday shortened week. It is a quiet week, except that it's not. We've been talking about this all week. It's the 2023 outlooks. We also have some key data coming out tomorrow, including consumer sentiment. It's a data dump. I mean, basically, am I right and that we're squeezing Wednesday, Thursday and even Friday and the one day? Exactly. Tomorrow is going to be the day on a week. On Friday. That's actually what I'm most interested about, especially in light of what we were talking about with 20% inflation. That Thanksgiving table and people going out how much is the conversation around the table not going to be Bitcoin? Not going to be a hat he get rich back. How do you just basically survive in an environment that's really the tightness of the economy? That's really the tightening of the screws. Yeah, features advanced. We'll get to the data check in that. But let's rip up the script here. Michigan is something that's just sort of tossed out. People look at it. People don't. Lisa, the five to 10 year inflation statistic. Nobody pays attention to this. Three percent. That's not what Jerome Powell wants. Jerome Powell specifically has said they pay really close attention to this and they care very much with the five to ten percent by a 10 year inflation. Well, we're not there yet, right? We've seen it kind of fluctuate back and forth. But what if you start to see it go up? What then? How does the Fed respond? What if you see sentiment plunge even more? There will be a little bit of a bit of a little bit of a little bit of comfort, but a sense that they can pull back, right? This is the reason why on the margins, this might matter quite a bit at a time when people are gathering around and kind of resetting. That's usually what happens. I'm going to reset. We were set for leftovers on Thanksgiving. I'm going to reset to the new home sales statistic at 10 o'clock on the 23rd tomorrow as well. But what we're really going to do is reset into that inflation report and the labor report all of a sudden important first week of December. How much can you actually start to see a labor market loosening up a little bit, right? They've wanted to see this and we really haven't seen this yet. You talked about this, Tom. And I think it's an important point. Tech jobs. Is that the tip of the iceberg? Is that an idiosyncratic story or is this something that you're going to do? Is that something that is a tea leaf for what's to come? Yeah, Ben Ladler was brilliant on this this morning and he was absolutely heated. The tech angst is way over done. He says, look, Amazon is exiting 1%. Maybe a little bit more of their employees and they're hiring in key areas while they lay off people. Yeah, I have real trouble carrying the text angst over the greater economy and talking about angst. We are seeing more shutdowns over in China and it's not feeding through. Hold on a second, but it's not feeding through the markets because you are seeing a bit of a lift. You're seeing the NASDAQ up nearly 4%, 10% the S. It's a little bit of a, you know, but it's like this is a little bit of a lift. And how much is it despite the negativity that you heard out of China despite the fact that there's a bit of cold weather in Europe? There's a sense that people are kind of pushing fast past these things. Yeah, I would mention 8877 on Brent Crude's Stephen Shorke moment to go. Look for the Shorke interview in its entirety. Out on digital, maybe it'll get out on YouTube 88 dollars 78 cents on Brent Crude. I mean, I hung on every word that Mr. Shorke said. There was a clinic on oil up to our eyeballs. Could you get under 70 dollars a barrel West Texas intermediate up to the legitimate angst. I believe he said, Alan Towne, Pennsylvania, with a dearth of diesel fuel this morning. We heard the OECD earlier this morning talking about the energy crisis really fueling a lot of what we've seen in terms of the inflation on the yield space. You are seeing it come in just a touch, although still very deeply inverted yield curve. We haven't talked about this, but the gap between 2 and 10s has is still staying around the lowest going back. Most negative since 1981. Yeah, we're going to recalibrate. Why don't you...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1850,2022-11-22 13:05:51
19237," about this, but the gap between two's and tens has is still staying around the lowest cornerback. Most negative since 1981 to give you a sense. Well, we're going to recalibrate. Why do you bring in Mr. Quinlan? You're he's done this before. He's done this before. Joe Kulman, head of CIO, market strategy at Merrill and Bank of America private bank joining us now. Joe, how do you recalibrate for next year, given the complete lack of clarity? Well, it's going to be tough heading into the New Year Lisa. We're looking at a recession here in the United States. Shallow first half of next year. Europe, I think, is already in recession and China's flatlining. That's around 65% of world GDP. So it's a chopping mark. Hit into 23, but we do think on the other side, say second quarter, third quarter of next year. We're going to be buyers of equities. We're going to reset here in the United States. We'll lead the way, but it's a chop and a churn as we go through the central bank tightening, pandemic in China and recession energy related in Europe. So it's very choppy. How much is that really hinge? It's sort of bullish call in the second half of next year hinge on a quick deterioration in the economy and a quick response from central bankers? Well, I think we're seeing the downturn in the economy and I think if the Fed just pauses in January and February, not necessarily, you know, have to cut that's kind of the green light for the equities that kind of the rebuild. Put that basin for the for the next bold market. So they don't have to start cutting. We don't I don't think they're going to be cutting anytime soon, but just the pause that the medicine work. See how quantitative tightening is working its way through the economy. Now the consumers hanging in there, you talk about the labor market for sure. So I think we just need a pause to kind of build the bottom for the whole market. Joe, the pause is there and it hinges on inflation. OECD came out with an inflation call today where global inflation next year again with all the angst in Europe is 6.8%. Let's be optimistic. It's lower in America. I think we can do that in Bank of America. No doubt would lead on that. Michael Gapin and and the rest. Joe Quiddlin does inflation actually come down enough next year in America. I think it does Tom. I really do because you're going to see the productivity gains come back. You're seeing the economy weakened. Commodity prices have rolled over. When you talk to kind of the people in the energy patch materials, their cost are, you know, their material costs are coming down. So I think I'm not in the deflation camp is hard landing when it comes to having prices come down hard. But I do think we're headed in the right direction and Europe, by the way, is going higher as you mentioned. And Japan could be an outlier as well. So I think inflation comes down significantly enough next year that it gives the Fed pause and the markets a lift to look forward into deeper into 23 and the 24. Well, okay. We get a pause and then we lift. Is it a lift with quality? I mean, Joe Quiddlin, you've been known for decades with a comfort and quality ownership to find what that is. Is it a free cash flow analysis? Is it a persistency of revenue analysis? It's going to be core companies, Tom. It's going to be brands. It's going to be good management. And I think it's going to be the global breath as matters as well. You know, when the Fed is done raising rates, the dollar is going to peak roll over. So multinational will have their day again. So to speak, we're looking for a second half recovery in Europe. Europe's a big market for US multinational's. Reflation in China and the rest of Asia is going to help drive. So we're looking for large cap quality names to push ahead with our healthcare technology, financials, industrials, and particular. You know, Tom, we've got a big story out there that we're not ready to talk about. And that's the rebuild of Ukraine. Now, it's too early to talk about that given what's happening there. But that's going to be very important for US industrial. Okay. Well, let's rip up the script, because this is hugely important. Fulcance Landau over Deutsche Bank agrees with you as well. I get that for Europe. I get it for Germany, et cetera. How does the rebuild of Ukraine assist our viewers and listeners in America? Well, remember, because US corporations, they're more ingrained in Europe than they are here in the United States. You know, Caterpillar, deer, big material companies. They have the plants already over in Europe and they'll be right there on the front lines to help rebuild. So it's not like we're going to be exporting Caterpillar machinery. We're going to make it in Europe and send it right across the border. So US companies are very well positioned to tap into that future to being coming out of the heart of Europe. There's a lot of time before then. And as we look out, it's...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1851,2022-11-22 13:10:14
19238," the border. So, US companies are very well positioned to tap into that future to be and coming out of heart of Europe. There's a lot of time before then and as we look out at two next year, one consensus has been a shallow recession. I know that that's what you are talking about as well. How do we know that a shallow recession isn't a new transitory? That's a good question, Lisa. We won't know into afterwards, but here's what I tell clients recessions. They're not, we've had them before. They're not terminal. Here in the United States recessions are not the most important. We're not going to know if it's shallow or not. And we do think it is because going into the recession, how soldering, good shape relatively speaking, corporations, housing markets, rollover. We know that. So this is a recession that's well telegraphed and well prepared. That's kind of the backdrop for, quote unquote shallow. Joe Quillen, thank you so much. Greatly appreciate it.

Right now, page one and page two, there is a couple of themes that have emerged. Page one by bonds by long term US Treasury. That's number one. Number two, we're going to see peak dollars some point next year. These are some of the consensus trades. A lot of these have been wrong for a long time. The other potential consensus that you're starting to see around the edges is China being a potential outperformer just because of how much bad news has been baked in. And some of the things and short shallow recession is also consensus. And that's also a question about whether that's actually achievable. That's always hazardous. I have trouble with that. What I will say and I say this with a lot of force corporations will adjust. They will adapt. You saw this with Disney yesterday. What's day two on Disney? I mean, I wrote a amount of employees.

Well, strange as it sounds, they might both be using the same technology. A lot of innovation has trickle down from the world of high tech engines and it hasn't just found a new life in road cars. F1 cars have long been thought of as the peak of cool and technology in them is also helping to pull down our produce aisles. Engineers from Williams are using their knowledge from nine instructors championships working with company Aerofoil to help reduce the energy consumption of supermarkets. The device they're building is based on the design of an F1 cars rear wing. It attaches to fridges to keep more cool air in the unit. They estimate it can reduce supermarket energy consumption by 25%. One innovation from F1 is also helping hybrids reduce their carbon footprint. That's curves or the kinetic energy recovery system. In common parlance, it's known as regenerative braking and works by storing energy of the car decelerating in a battery for later use. If that's not enough, F1 is now looking at hers or a thermal energy recovery system looking to harness the heat produced from braking and the engine exhaust. That could allow cars to generate the same power using 30% less fuel. So while F1 may have a reputation as a gas doesler, some of its innovations in the name of speed are helping in the everyday fight against climate change.

Maybe you guys could phone in. You could call in. Yeah, I'm assuming. You know, you know, you will. Yeah, we can do a remote. That would be great. We'll have to see there right now. We're watching Denmark, Tunisia. And they got to be sober. Don't you think it's got to be a totally different game after what the world just witnessed with the huge upside of Argentina? I was going to say, Tell me a different game. How much are we going to start to see the underdogs really start to make some inroads here? That's pretty incredible. Argentina was one of the leading candidates to win. World Cup analysis here with Lisa Bramuts and Tom Keen. It's a value add this morning as their futures. Up 17, a little bit of an opportunity. I'm asking me. Of course, I'm delaying to get to Isaac Boltansky. Isaac Boltansky with us. Ohio Wesleyan, which means he's encyclopedic on Ohio, which I'm told is one of three or four states. It really, really matter in 2022 on to 2024 at BTIG encyclopedic on the inside the beltway chat. Isaac, Ohio, how do you and adapt to just after what you saw in that Senate race? Look, I'll tell you, I think there are many takeaways from election night. But one of the main ones for me, Tom, is neither Florida nor Ohio are purple states anymore. I think that we need to operate under the assessment that both of those are going red. And that really changes the electoral map for the next presidential election. I strongly, strongly agree with you that the Redder got redder and the Bluer got bluer. What does it mean for a majority Republican house? How do they prosecute gridlock given the polarity that we learned about the first Tuesday of November? Yeah, look, when we look at the composition of this new Congress, I think part of it is due to our primary system. Right. And when you look at the House of Representatives, Tom, what I find interesting is roughly only 15% of those 435 seats were really competitive, which means that the rest of them were decided in the primaries. And frankly, that's not really good for governance. It's good for politics because both ends skewed to the extreme, but it's not good for the actual governance of the country. And so that means we're going to have to look towards these deadlines. Once again, all of us have to focus on deadlines, whether it's spending or the debt ceiling, because those are the forcing mechanisms for legislative. Meanwhile, we are looking at ongoing concern in the labor market, not with respect to layoffs with respect to strikes. And I do want to bring this to you because I've seen a slew of notes and concern about this huge railway strike as they're the standoff kind of hardens with the Biden administrations outreach to them. How likely do you see some sort of stoppage in the rail system in the United States, given that this is really pervasive and it's going on for months now. Well, I'll tell you there is real palpable concern in policy circles that we're going to have. Stopages and I would say this even and doing my rounds on this. There's concern in policy circles that even you're going to start to see pressures in these these marketplaces and ripple effects, even before stopages and you have lots of folks around the country who are traveling, not to mention the goods and Christmas time and everything else that comes out of it. My contacts generally believe that Congress will be able to act here. There's a law called the Railway Labor Act and that lets Congress come in to either impose a resolution based on what the president's emergency board submitted.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1854,2022-11-22 13:23:05
19241," law called the Railway Labor Act. And that lets Congress come in to either impose a resolution based on what the president's emergency board submitted this past summer or to basically punt and kick the can down the road to require operations as is for say three or six months. My sense is that you will get some movement closer to the deadline in part because there's a Republican House and that Republican House is not going to be nearly as friendly to to some of these unions and will most likely call for a reversion back to that plan in the summer which was not as as accommodating as some of the one-off union agreements we've seen since then. There's a broader issue Isaac. Earlier in the year we talked a lot about the shift in power to labor, to the worker, to basically be able to demand higher pay, especially in light of the inflation. Right now it's getting harder. We've known we've talked about a bit of elucinating, a little bit greater slack in the labor market. From your vantage point, politically, is there also less willingness to allow labor to sort of cane the upper hand at a time when economic growth and frankly the mix of Congress has changed? Yeah, so I think a great example when we think about this is the Biden administration's independent contractor role which came out and spooked some of the folks around these ride-sharing apps like Uber and Lyft for example, or DoorDash. The Biden administration actually took a less aggressive stance in that role making than some expected. Now part of that is to do the limits. The part of it's also they don't want to be responsible for driving up costs even further for the average consumer. Isaac, very quickly here, we're running out of time but I've got to go to this. There's Isaac Boltsinsky writing on something I never thought you'd write on which is Congress doing something about targeted stablecoin. Are we actually going to get regulation to police this industry blow up? So the simple answer Tom is we're not getting comprehensive reform anytime soon. The most that Congress can be expected to do with the crypto events of the past few weeks is to focus on something they kind of understand which is stablecoins. Stablecoins look a little bit like money market funds, a little bit like deposit accounts. They get that and that's something they can legislate on. The rest of it, I think that we are years away from a comprehensive legislative solution. So instead of breaking the buck on a money market fund you break the bit dog, is that how this works? What is a stablecoin? Yeah look all that they are really pushing for and they being Congress in this instance is stability and transparency ensuring that you have a one-to-one back. That's it. That sounds like my thanks giving dinner conversation. Just stability and transparency. Isaac Boltsinsky thank you so much. Been way too long at BTIG. Stablecoin come on Lisa. It makes sense. I get it. Well hold on a second. There basically is this concept like tether for example that it's it's pegged to the dollar. So there's a sense that there is a direct relationship and there's some reserves. So it's not necessarily well you have seen it go below that which is speculation that there is not enough in terms of what's been put aside to back it and a lot of people push back on that. I don't know these are big questions it's unclear what's going to happen it's unclear what the fallout is and how unique some of these crypto assets are from one another. I think we're on our date calendar here at our World Headquarters. Sinaly Bassock may darken the door with this here and this hour to give us an update on stablecoin. I can't say this with a straight face. Stablecoin. The dose. Sinaly was leading on the dose. She was into that big. Yeah my kids were two. They're really into dogecoin. Are you serious? Yeah they were. You left them do that with your allowance? No no no like it was based on a game that they played and you could get dogecoin. I mean that was part of the whole thing was why is it different than what we're going to write now. I mean that there's sort of money that they have online in the metaverse that also is having.

19243," to Dana Peterson with the conference board. She could join us, but first with an update of the last 60 minutes on stable coin, the unstable, finale, basic joins us now. What have you done the last hour and 15 minutes? Give us a window into the life of Bitcoin at Bloomberg. Well, first of all, we reported that Genesis may seek bankruptcy. If they can't find the money they need, they are still talking to folks across Wall Street who are getting a very intimate view into what the balance sheet looks like. So how do you finance the crypto ecosystem? You're asking about stable coins. There's a whole other thing happening where there's dozens of private equity firms looking at ways to onboard into private equity funds using stable coin, which I heard you guys talking earlier is essentially back one to one to the dollar or another fiat. Are they looking to save Genesis or not save, but are they looking to assist Genesis? Big smart private equity money, big smart hedge funds in the major banks. Are they out there? It's like anything else in distress. What do I get for my money? I thought that for the morning, they don't do a Warren Buffett convertible preferred, do they? Nothing's over till it's over. That's the reality in this situation. It bankruptcy is certainly a possibility here. And if that does happen, there are plenty of people on the line that want that to happen because then they recoup some money rather than lose it all. So you see with FTX, for example, they had nothing and now they have a billion dollars. So what's the oxygen? What's the oxygen between stable coins and things that were more established and used for some sort of substitute fiat currency and Bitcoin and some of the other crypto assets that don't have the same kind of ballast? On one end of the spectrum, I hear you guys talk about this a lot with this SEC, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the war in the United States that exists between the SEC and tokenization, the FTT token, other tokens. Or tokenization. tokenization. So are these assets listed as securities or not? That is the big fight between coin base and the SEC and many others. Then you have stable coins, which are essentially, as you say, one to one, with certain more safe assets. You want to see the reserves here. That's a big thing that people are really finally coming to in this industry. We want to know what's backing every single asset here, but it should trade one to one with the dollar if it's a US statement. What's your sense in terms of the next development here of contagion? If you say you're midway through or we're a midway through whatever is happening in terms of this melt sound, what is the breadth of losses, the breadth of pain, the breadth of potential opportunity given the fact that so many institutions are interested? We were talking about this yesterday on radio for a bit. When Mt. Gox failed, after 2014, what you had was firms like Fortress come in and buy Bitcoin claims at hundreds of dollars. And if that was the case, and Bitcoin flew past $10,000, you're still pretty rich. And so is this an opportunity here to buy assets on the cheap? Remember, some of these assets are purely cash. Some of these are loans. Some of them are tokens, which to your point here, without that regulatory clarity, people are concerned about. Part of this is they're trying to buy Bitcoin because they believe it's $16,000. It's a value. There are certainly people who buy that. There are certainly people who come on this show that are trading it on the side that I'll tell you back to. What a lunch. No, I'm not sick. We're this year until late tonight with our store with Lydia Bayot and our crypto team. Look for crypto on Bloomberg Television as well today. We migrate to something more stable. And that would be economics. Dana Peterson joins us of Wesleyan in University of Wisconsin. Economics at Madison and Thrill that she could join us this morning. OECD came out with a big fancy report, Dana. Yours is more important. How have you tweaked your view for next year on real GDP? Well, we think that the economy is probably going to be flat next year. And that incorporates a couple of quarters of recession. Maybe the fourth quarter of this year is a little bit negative. But really most of the brunt we think will be in the first quarter of next year, minus 1 1 1, 1 1 1, and then second quarter minus 4 10s. And then kind of a moderate increase in the back half of next year. So all folding up into pretty much again, flat growth for the economy. How do you respond to what the conference board is seeing over the many decades of when inflation spikes up as a general rule, but stochastic and comes down with quite a plunge with great rapidity. Do you buy that that we could see that? Well, when I look at the components of what's driving inflation right now, you can've seen it being higher tax on future registration.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1857,2022-11-22 13:36:16
19244," comes down with quite a plunge with great rapidity. Do you buy that that we could see that? Well, when I look at the components of what's driving inflation right now, a lot of its rents, right? And then the other aspects are services, non-housing services. But when you look at rents, they're really sticky and they tend to reflect what has already happened in the housing market. And we know that rents are difficult to come off because certainly people being pushed out of the new and existing home sales market, they're going to go into the rental market. So that means that we're probably going to have a period of time where rents are still going to continue to push up inflation. Dana, how much do you buy this idea of a shallow recession? Well, our own forecast suggests that yes, the recession will be shallow. And indeed, along with that, you might not have a really big hit to the labor market. A lot of that's a function of labor shortages. So if you have companies hoarding workers and still also hiring people, especially in those in-person services and other types of jobs where you physically have to be at work, that's going to support consumption. And so we may not have a really deep recession. But that sort of is a bit of a bet on the fact that things will deteriorate quickly enough for the Fed to pause, for the lag effects to actually kick in and show us that there is some sort of active deceleration and inflation that gives the Fed confidence, right? I mean, without that, if there is momentum, how much does that really cast this idea of a shallow recession aside? Well, I think the Fed is looking at the data, right? So already the housing market tends to react very quickly to interest rate hikes. And we're also starting to see consumers dial back their expectations for how many like durable goods they're going to purchase, especially things that need to be financed. So the Fed is already seeing some of that evidence, but certainly there are lags. And it's not clear how long those lags are, but I would suggest that the Fed still has some way to go in terms of raising interest rates, but that those interest rate hikes are probably going to be smaller than what we've seen. Dana, I'm fascinated. And again, this is the heritage of the conference board, which going back to 1947 has always aggregated our economics. Are we so polarized as a society of the halves and have knots that you can't aggregate your macro analysis as the conference board is done for decades? Well, I mean, the good news is that even though we do have aggregates, we also look at individual income groups, especially with our consumer confidence data. Well, the youngest and the oldest groups are a little bit more discontent than the folks in the middle. And certainly people who are at the lower end of the income spectrum are being hit harder by inflation. So we can look at those details there. I'm, please Lisa pick it up. Well, I'm actually wondering how much this has to do with homeownership, right? If the younger people are not able to get into homes and they're seeing their rents increase, and it's absolutely prohibitive to go and buy a home for the first time because interest rates because mortgage rates are 7%. How much is that distinguishing feature right now between the halves and the have knots? Well, certainly is a distinguishing feature, but let's not forget during the pandemic, the biggest increase in homeownership was among the younger groups, right? Gen, Gen, while the millennials, right? Because many of them, you know, have children now, they have been able to get jobs and they've accumulated some savings. And certainly there were injections of cash for the fiscal stimulus. So that did help them at least during the pandemic. Those who were gone and got in there early to buy homes. The millennials have their kids playing investing in doge off their couch. I mean, that's how bad it is. Dave, I want to go back to what we're going to see here on the inflation guesstimate for December before the Fed meeting. Is that a mystery to you? Or do you have some confidence in the conference board? Pick for what inflation will be before December 14th? Well, we think that inflation is going to continue to ease. We probably reached a peak earlier this year. We're seeing food and energy prices come off. And certainly in the last few months in terms of their contributions. And that's really important in terms of bringing down the aggregate level of inflation. And also things like utilities for for home, for people who, you know, all the people who live in homes. But certainly we're concerned about again, the rents and services prices continuing to rise in place pressure.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1858,2022-11-22 13:40:29
19245," home for people who know all the people who live in homes. But certainly we're concerned about again the rents and services prices continuing to rise and place pressure on upward pressure on inflation. Dana Peterson, thank you so much with the conference board. Did she tell me I was disgruntled? I think that's what I heard. Well, I was just distracted. I did not let my kids put real money into Dogecoin, but they were really familiar with it from Roblox because I let them play a lot of video games. $16,000 exactly up almost $400 in Bitcoin. I don't know what to make of it. It gets us on radio, Matt Miller and Paul Sweeney will chime in and then crypto on television this afternoon. Conflating crypto in Bitcoin, I have learned is perhaps a little bit of a faulty exercise. A lot of mail on that. I think it's important to sort of highlight how much love we really do get. Coming up, we're going to talk about that love. Also the road ahead as we try to chart something of a consensus into 2023, Barry Bannister of Steeple, Nicholas, Nadia, level of UBS. Newvians, Brian Nick, all joining us on the 9 a.m. show. Really, I'm curious how much people are looking to China as sort of the peripheral deciding factor to your point earlier, Tom, not only with oil prices, but also global growth. Oil up $1.73, Brent Crude, 8917 going back up near 90 again. Again, that's the back and forth that we've seen on oil today. Not much else going on. Yen, with that move, yesterday, 141 comes back a little bit with a stronger. Yen, Lisa, I do want to go to the seven-year auction series that we make jokes about it, folks, but actually I find that in between the seven-year auction, actually a lot more informative. Do we have auctions next week? I think that that is going to be on hold. I'm pretty sure I will get that to you. I think that this week is the auction week. One thing that I'm watching, Abercrombie and Fitch, they did better than expected, which is surprising because you would think that marginal income would not go to your teenagers. But I'm just thinking that it's really interesting that net sales came in ahead of what the expectations were. It's just that highlights this point, this sort of bifurcated picture of retailer to retailer. Over the years, there's been like 12 Abercrombie and Fitches. I think there's been like iteration of... Arrow Postal, which is still exactly exists. So, where are you thinking of? I don't know. What do I know about that world? I don't know. I don't know. Glossier and you were talking about what's the one that we're everything is to squire. Glossier, I think, has potential here. You know, if you look at the lines out of A&F, look at the lines outside Sephora. There's the wreck. That's a, yeah, talk about a rocket. But really good stuff. We will see. Keep in you up to date with Newsom around the world with the first word. I'm Lisa Mateo. The US prosecutors had begun an investigation of FTX months before the crypto exchange collapsed. Bloomberg's learned that prosecutors in New York had started poking into FTX's massive exchange operations. It was part of a sweeping examination of cryptocurrency platforms with US and offshore arms. The World Health Organization warns that millions of lives are at risk in Ukraine this winter. The UN agency cites damage or destroyed infrastructure that has left 10 million people without power. That's about one-fourth of Ukraine's population. Goldman Sachs is forecasting that the S&P 500 index and its earnings will see little change next year. The firm expects margins will contract due to upward cost pressures from wages, commodities, goods and services. Goldman urged investors to own defensive sectors with low interest rate, risk like health care and consumer staples. China reportedly is set to find Jack Ma's and group worth $1 billion dollars.

If NAC was started under President Clinton and Bob Rubin was the first person to hold that job, can you explain to people what it actually does and what the NAC does day to day? For example, who's in the NAC, who's on the NAC? What is your job actually to do? Also the National Economic Council, the job, the mandate, the mission of the organization is to coordinate economic policy across the executive branch and across the cabinet to make sure that the president is getting the benefit of when making decisions of his entire economic cabinet and also that the economic cabinet is getting clear direction from the president as well. So that two ways. It's a coordination function on the NAC itself are all of the relevant cabinet members, the core economic team, OMB, Council of Economic Advisors, Treasury, but also Secretary of Labor, Secretary of Commerce. My team, the NAC team is a small team within the White House that is our job is to do that coordination across the range of economic policies. Now you were the deputy in the Obama administration at the NAC and now you're the director. Which NAC work better, the Obama administration one or the Biden one? Well on the issues that I worked on in the Obama administration, it worked very, very well and the current NAC works very well as well. When I started I had no idea it was going to turn into this, which is a tricycle empire. I don't have any investors. All this is all money in. This is me going out in Hustlin, bringing that money back and just building it and building it. Yeah, I think about a person that was homeless at one point, didn't really have any money coming in. The fact that this person was relentless and just determined to succeed and not let rock bottom define him as an individual, I can take things and put them together and take them apart and make them better and put them back together. I respect the craft so I don't want to minimize and disrespect the value of each step of the craft and do by machine what should be done by hand. This is Bluebrook Daybreak with Lake.

19247," growing at 20% a year, which we know eventually comes to an end. It always does. It always has it always will. So saying we're going to give you something guaranteed, right? But it's dependent on a highly volatile asset that has a long history of swinging up and down and going through these massive crypto winters from day one. This was deeply flawed, but it appeals to people's sense of magic money machine. One of the magic things here folks is I don't manage money. Ritholz does. Ritholz has losses and gains. He has to justify every tick of the day. I take huge issue with media elites who go to billionaires and gazillionaires that got in on the floor and even at 16,000, 16,000 exactly, they're still in a profit mode. How do you perceive how much damage is out there? How many people have been run over by Bitcoin from 20,000 to 16,000? Or dare I say if it breaks even lower? So I think of Bitcoin and some of the other crypto as a single large cap stock. When Bitcoin was $3 trillion, what is it? An apple and a half, two Amazon's. It used to be three Facebook's, now six Facebook's. So it's not an asset class like fixed income or equities or real estate. It's a pretty narrow group with a very, very deep narrative that had a lot of very, very strong adherence. The problem is the narratives have all broken down, right? DeFi, decentralized finance turns out to be a fantasy. Because when trouble comes, the first thing people say are, where are the regulators? Where is Congress? I found them slacking. It might run against the slack because of the abroad. It's not audited. It's not this. It's not that. And it's foreign. It's offshore. You know, the security is exchange commission can regulate securities. How do you define Bitcoin as a security? It's an asset that trades, but is it a security under the legal definition that gives them authority over it? And arguably the reason Gensler didn't, hasn't wanted this in an ATF is there's no control. There's no what? There's no ability to guarantee the safeguards of a trade the way we can with every single share of stock, pretty much every single bond that's out there. It's a very, very different regulatory environment because you have control and the whole purpose of Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies is decentralized. Right. Use your control transparent. No need for regulators. And that turned out to be a fantasy. Let's switch gears here for the last minute. Do your clients want to own equities into 2023? Are they scared stiff, petrified? So we have done a very good job on educating our clients over the years, not to think in terms of days, weeks, months, quarters, but years and decades. Our clients don't care about 2022 or 2023. They're much concerned. Even their bond clients? Absolutely. They're much more concerned about 2030, 2035, 2040. Come on. I'm not concerned about 2040. Farrow is, but yeah, okay. I've got the Austria and the European peace. They're concerned about their retirement, their generational wealth transfer, their philanthropy, things like that don't matter quarter to quarter year to year. They matter over the arc of time. Any giving year in the market can be plus 20% minus 20% or worse, but there has never been a 20 year run in US history where equities have been negative and very, very few 15 year runs. So we've had a huge decade from 2010 to 2020 and then 20 and 21 were massive. After those sort of gains, you look at this year, this Anis Harubles. And you have to just say this is something that you have to accept occasionally some drawdowns. The difference between equities and crypto is equities or a future stream of income. It's a discounted cash flow. Whereas crypto is, you're just hoping the price goes higher and that's very different. Hey, Mel, already coming in. Very good. It holds successful again.

We want to make sure that people understand, especially in Wyoming, but as the United States as a whole, this trend is coming. It's not going to stop. This is more of a small town that's growing into what I would call the cryptocurrency version of Silicon Valley. It's the philosophy of that rugged individualism, the independence, and the ability to really get things done for yourself and control your own destiny. You get that from a blockchain, and you don't get that without it. From New York City for a viewers worldwide, I'm Lisa Bronwyn's in for Jonathan Farrah right now.

19249," lift ahead of the Thanksgiving break the S&P up about a half a percent the Nasdaq up similarly the countdown to the open starts right now Everything you need to get set for the start of U.S. training This is Bloomberg the open with Jonathan Perra We begin with the big issue seeing more pain until the pivot there's still a lot of vocalist yet to come and see through from the Fed underway inequities at the moment stocks can still lag from here another move down I could see another five 10% lower on the second market how many more ratehouse will be getting wasting for that moment when the Fed is likely to To pivot here is it from Fed equity markets in general I think they're brought you know until such time We've seen more positive signals. We're one who'd bake a point. I do think that you know people are being a little bit too optimistic You want to have another better point for showing that the vision-fishing trade is on The market will recently be partying in the impending downturn that's the cup The playbook is you have to get defensive Joining us now new beams at Brian Nick and Nadia level of UBS pain until the pivot Brian is that your idea as well That basically we need to see ongoing revisions to earnings ongoing revisions to valuations until the Fed blinks I think that's right and they made that pretty clear I think the markets are really Focusing on the fact that the Fed's likely to decelerate the pace of high I think they're focusing less on the promise of more hikes into the future and maybe a higher terminal rate So until the market gets that gets that pricing right it feels it could be status quo Which for 2022 has been interest rates are going up and they're going up by more than you think That's very hard for diversified investors to navigate through that environment cleanly So then there gets becomes the question how high is the bar for the pivot or for perhaps the cutting of race because the pivot is not just simply Stopping on raising those rates Nadia. What's your view? Yeah, I mean we think that is going to require inflation to really come down I mean the most recent inflation numbers encourage it But it's still too early to have a party We think you're not going to get something with a 2% handle Until the late half of 2023 and that's when the Fed might be able to take the photo of the pedal And cut we do expect another 50 that 50 basis points in December and another 50 in 2023 And do we think that the federal pause in the early part of the year But it will take a lot more to get a pivot and you also the fact is keenly focused on the labor market So we also need to see the unemployment rate sort of take up before the federal be comfortable in In doing a rate cut and there's a lot of faith right now in the idea of lag of facts the idea that the The right hikes that we've seen this year from central banks around the world will start to really bring inflation down more sharply Next year at the OECD not necessarily agreeing raising its inflation forecast for 2023 saying quote right now controlling inflation Has to be the top priority or we end up with a situation that inflation becomes so entrenched That the pay needed to control it will be even greater risks of overshooting are certainly less than risks of an action Brian based in the lag of facts based on the tea leaves that we've seen in the housing market And other sort of first movers in response to the rate hikes. Do you think that this is true? I don't actually I think that we're going to see inflation come down in the first half of next year pretty quickly For reasons that may not have anything to do with what the feds up to we're seeing goods price deflation It's about as powerful as we've ever seen we're seeing energy prices potentially also food prices starting to roll over So if those things that are sort of Around the periphery of what the feds able to control start to cause inflation to moderate start to cause real wage growth to turn from sharply negative which has been all year to positive that could actually be a bit of a tailwind for consumers who yes are going to have to face The the lag defect of you know higher interest rates potentially less hiring going on less negotiation for nominal wage growth in their jobs But as long as real wages are coming up because inflation is moderating I think we should see the consumer carous forward at least into the second half of next year Which raises a question of whether we really can see the shallow recession now Yeah, that so many people are expecting this idea that we can get some sort of I don't want to say Goldilocks scenario But in a place where the fed can really cut rates do you feel like there is more resilience that we're seeing in the earnings of retailers and beyond from cuz uh",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1863,2022-11-22 14:05:54
19250," scenario, but in a place where the Fed can really cut rates, do you feel like there is more resilience that we're seeing in the earnings of retailers and beyond from consumers than to allow some of the lag effects to just take hold and inflation to really keep going up? You know, we do think that you can achieve a shallower recession. That's the, I mean, the consumer does remain quite strong. We're seeing the corresponding in retail earning this week and also in terms of retail sales, but you know, the consumer spending is shifting. It continues to shift away from goods and towards services. I think what's given consumer confidence in spread to spend is the labor market. You know, the unemployment rate still remains pretty lower 3.7 percent. We're seeing, you know, more to layoffs and tech. And if that becomes more widespread, then we think that this consumer will be more concerned about job security. And probably tighten their bell as we get into 2023. But the consumer balance sheet remains very strong. So this corporate balance sheet and the consumer does have a lot more fixed debt than it did versus variable debt that it did in the large financial crisis. And as those corporate says, so we think that because of the health of the balance sheets, that that will allow for more shallower recession than we have seen in the past. And Veronica Clark over at City Group also pointing to next week's jobs data. Take a listen to what she had to say. Next week, of course, we'll get a lot of labor market data. That will be very important. For the Fed right now, if we do get some slowing and inflation, which it seems like we might, but you're not seeing it in the slowing and service inflation, that's related to a tight labor market. And then you do need to see that loosening in the labor market data. Nadia, from your vantage point, is the tech industry and how much we have seen the layoffs picking up there? A sort of precursor to what to expect more broadly or an idiosyncratic sort of mismatch in size and staffing based on the mismatch and expectations for certain companies. I think that tech isn't reflected of the broader economy. And tech is really with the excesses for tech is a pandemic kind of fishery. So there was a pickup in hiring it. And our companies are trying to write size that. There's still other areas of the economy that does continue to have labor shortages. I mean, we heard throughout the earnings season, particularly from some of the aerospace, air force and defense companies that they have lost engineers to tech companies. So now some of that can reverse and maybe the hiring can pick up in some of those areas that we've seen shortages. And so we don't think that tech is a broader look on the economy, but we do expect the unemployment rate to pick up. I mean, even the Fed itself in their forward projections is looking for a pickup and an unemployment rate. Meanwhile, investors assessing the lag. What we've been talking about between monetary policies and the effect in the real economy, San Francisco Fed president Mary Daley weighing in. Take a listen. As we work to bring policy to what we call a sufficiently restrictive stance, which really in simple terms means the level required to bring inflation down every store price stability, we will need to be mindful. Adjusting too little will leave inflation too high. And adjusting too much could lead to an unnecessarily painful downturn. Joining us right now, I'm very happy to say is Bloomberg's very own Michael McKee. Mike, so much Fed speak a very similar message across the board. Yeah, that's pretty much the case. I mean, Mary Daley laying out kind of the existential question, which begs the question of what is the right level for the federal funds rate? You know, there's an old saying it's hard to make predictions, particularly about the future. The markets are predicting that the Fed's going to continue raising rates. They've got 50 basis points priced in for December and then 325 basis point moves after that. And then they think they're going to cut. Now, the Fed doesn't think so. And their argument is we get to the terminal rate. And as Lisa said, there's more and more agreement. It's going to be 5% give or take 13 or 15 basis points. They're going to leave the interest, the terminal rate where it is for 12 to 18 months. Now, that's going to depend on what happens with the economy. And I think some of your earlier comments, address that. The idea that we're going to now have to start paying attention not just to inflation, but to growth and unemployment. The OECD forecast out this morning show the US slowing to just half a percent growth next year, which is a little bit stronger than the Bloomberg consensus forecast this month. And of course, the Fed hasn't made a forecast since September. They'll make one in December. So we can.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1864,2022-11-22 14:10:14
19251," percent growth next year, which is a little bit stronger than the Bloomberg consensus forecast this month. And of course, the Fed hasn't made a forecast since September. They'll make one in December. So we can't really count them, but this is where they are. They think the OECD thinks PCE core rate will decline to 3.6 percent. Bloomberg economists a little more optimistic than that. An unemployment doesn't rise very much under this scenarios, but if it does, does the Fed have to react? Well, that means that you got to stop paying attention to what they're going to do in December and what they're saying now and tomorrow and the next day and start looking ahead to the data that come out between now and say March or May when the meetings are that they might end up with what they're doing. So write this down. You've got CPI coming out every month, middle of the month, GDP, the fourth quarter numbers come out at the end of January, the first quarter numbers at the end of April, and then these unemployment numbers. If we see deterioration in the numbers, then we're going to see the Fed perhaps start to change its tune. If we don't, then the Fed may hold where they are and we'll see what we end up with, but we're not going to be able to tell people in the markets right now. Michael McKee, thank you so much, Brian Nick, and Nadia Lovell still with us. We are getting a host of data out tomorrow in particular having to do with the housing market, Brian. I'd love your perspective on what you're expecting with that given that we have seen this sales slow, but not necessarily prices decline as much as some people might expect. Yeah, that's also because what the Fed's been up to when they've been very clear about it since the beginning of this year, tightening policy has also impacted the supply side. So, whether there's still a lot of homes in the process of being built, there aren't that many new starts, there aren't that many building permits, the architectural hirings have gone down. So, the leading indicator for all this housing construction have really struggled and are plummeting at some of the fastest places we've ever seen. And that's because this sector of the economy is very interest rate sensitive. To the extent this is going to affect things beyond just the housing market, it's going to continue to hit the demand. And I think if it's the prices for durable goods, the types of things that people buy when they move into a new home, sales have slowed down. It's not as many people moving into new houses for the foreseeable future. You're going to see furniture, appliances, all the things that people use to fill those homes, the price of those things are going to continue to move down. So, overall, the Fed is accomplishing some measure of sort of disinflationary, deflationary pressure, but they're doing it sort of a bank shot via the housing market. Brian, when we head into 2023, what are you most confident in in terms of some sort of asset class to hide out in? I'm much more confident that fixed income is going to have a reasonably good year, certainly compared to 2022, which is not much of a bar for sure considering it's the worst year you've seen. Heather, but I think if we're talking about the scenario next year where the Fed hikes rates to say five, five and a quarter somewhere around there, and just holds them there, and the economy doesn't have a hard landing and the Fed's able to keep downward pressure on inflation, that's going to be a pretty good year for fixed income. Not a great year, not a 2014, not a 1995, but if you're just clipping coupons at this new high, and I think probably temporary level of interest rates, I think as a fixed income investor, you're going to be much happier equity markets. I think you're going to be more troubled by the Fed holding rates at that level, and it's going to be harder to see that kind of that slow, gride lower in growth, causing companies to be able to sustain profit margins at the current levels. Nadia, do you agree with this? It seems like increasingly this is the consensus that bonds are a good place, least I say for bonds in the US, equities not so much in 2023. We agree with that for the most part, we think that that higher coupons that investors can clip can help to have some cushioned within the fixed income market. Within the equity market, we remain somewhat cautious still. We still think that the consensus expectations for artists are too high. We have a market that's rallying into the Gare-Anne and sort of trading, as if the economy is going to expand, and PMIs are going to expand in 2023. We think that they're going to contract, and we think that estimates at the very least is going to contract by at least 4%, and if we end up in a deeper recession, you could see a 20% contract. We just don't think that the risk reward is set up very favorably for the equity markets as we head into 2023, and we think that some of those lows that we have seen recently can be retested in the first half of the year. We would be more in favor of the fixed income market at the stage versus the equity market. We think that investors will get up.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1865,2022-11-22 14:14:38
19252," It's seen recently can be retested in the first half of the year. So we would be more in favor of the 16th market at the stage versus the equity market. We think that investors will get a better entry point in the equity market in the first half next year. Nadi level Brian Nick. Both of you are going to be sticking with us. Let's take a look right now at some of the stocks that are moving ahead of the opening bell. Here is our own Abigail do a little Abby. Hey Lisa. Well on oils rebound after a wild ride yesterday, but I'm various headlines on OPEC plus in a possible Saudi output. It's not true. We have energy stocks rebounding as well. Exxon mobile Chevron, an accidental all higher turning to retail, some positive reports out of both apacromy Fitch and Best Buy has those stocks higher on the other hand zoom and peloton those pandemic darlings will not so much record low revenue growth for zoom that really tells the story Lisa. Thank you so much Abby Abigail. Meanwhile coming up China's painful reopening threatening more economic strain. We are not full on on the China reopened trade right now. We still stay a bit cautious here, so we are still a bit underweight in the Chinese space. That conversation still ahead from New York. Yeah! Vietnamese consumers are very aspirational. You've got millions of people riding motorbikes, and they want to be riding inside cars. Vindru, Vietnam's biggest conglomerate has really tapped into that. The founder and chairman aspires to be the Elon Musk of Vietnam. Vung is Vietnam's richest man with outsized ambitions. He wants to sell cars not only to the Vietnamese, but also Americans and other consumers around the world. If Vindfast is successful, that goes very well with ambition of the Communist Party of Vietnam. But if they fail, it will be very, very hard to win Vindru and also to the National Commune. We are not full on the China Rio. We are still a bit cautious here, so we are still a bit underweight in the Chinese space. However, if we would see a change in things, we would start to add on to the consumer side, where we think there's still potential commers and also reopening to happen. China COVID infections, continuing to march higher restrictions now weighing on a fifth of the nation's economy. Fueling tensions at home as tensions, simmer abroad, the U.S. pressing China to ease up on Taiwan. Defense chiefs of the meeting in Cambodia are scheduled to.

Well, we've seen the U.S. roll out this sort of drumbeat of visitors to the.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1866,2022-11-22 14:19:05
19253," Well, we've seen the U.S. sort of roll out this sort of drumbeat of visitors to the Indo-Pacific region. Of course, Joe Biden was there last week. Kamala Harris, Lloyd Austin, the Defense Secretary, this week. And, you know, that bilateral meeting about a week ago with President Xi Jinping and President Biden really was a watershed moment in those U.S. China relations in particular under this president who has kind of, you know, talked a lot about having spent a lot of time with Xi Jinping being able to sort of speak his language a little bit proverbially and see where they're going. So I think what they're, they were trying to do is bring down the temperature. It seems that that has been the case, the sort of mood music, if you will, out of bilateral meeting has been pretty positive. And the question is where does that go from here? There's sort of reopening channels that have been kind of dormant or, you know, slam shut in the aftermath of Speaker Pelosi's visit to Taiwan. The question is how far that reopening goes, you know, and whether whether it can last, you know, has this all been a little bit of cleanup on Pelosi, at least implicitly, yeah, a little bit. And so, of course, the other question is, are there other visits that could happen to Taiwan? Are there members of Congress, for instance, that could sort of set off the Chinese in a way that Pelosi's visit did and sort of send us back to Square One? When you talk about reopening in, in morale or in relationships with Taiwan and China and the U.S., there's also the reopening when it comes to COVID, Kayleigh. A lot of people talking about how there was a shift in tone from China in terms of perhaps easing off zero COVID. The latest cues, perhaps not a sanguine. Yeah, it was relatively recently that China was talking about easing up on some of the most restrictive control measures. It was only about a week ago, and yet what we are seeing on the ground in the country now is a rise in the virus case load. About 27,300 cases were reported on Monday. That is just shy of the previous record of 28,973, which was reached in April when the Shanghai outbreak led to a surge in infections. In this current wave, it's Guangzhou, that is the epicenter with the bulk of infections. China's top health officials are vowing to stick to COVID-0. Beijing is telling local governments to implement those updated guidelines and not be excessive when it comes to controls. But still, we are seeing these measures being put back into place. Namorah, as you mentioned at the top, Lisa says roughly 20 percent of China's economy is currently being affected by restrictions. Even though we aren't seeing citywide lockdowns being ordered, about 48 cities are subject to some form of district level or widespread movement restrictions and local authorities and big cities have also reintroduced measures like expanded testing and closing schools and offices. So, as a result, Namorah says the path to reopening in China is going to be slow, painful and bumpy, and they only expect GDP growth of about 4.3 percent in the country next year. No surprise, all of that has started to weigh on market sentiment. We all have been cleaned to optimism about the reopening of this economy. Chinese tech stocks in particular are really good example of that frenzy in the first half of this month. From the beginning of November through the 15th, the Hongstand tech index rallied 33 percent. But in recent days, as the headlines have started to shift, we have seen some of those gains given back now only up about 23 percent on the month. And of course, that's carrying through to some of those ADRs of those big tech companies that are listed here in the U.S. Lisa. Kaley Lyons and Joshua Wingrove. Thank you both so much, Brian Nick and Nadia Lovell are back with us. Nadia from your vantage point, one of the key consensus calls heading into next year is that China will outperform based on the low expectations. In your year of inflection points, do you see that as likelihood? You know, we think it's going to be a bumpy ride in China. It's going to be volatile as a reopen in process happen. It's going to take a long time. We're not really looking for any meaningful change in the reopening process until the third quarter of next year. We think it's going to be fixed and starts. And that's going to create some volatility. So we are neutral on China. We think as you get into 2024, then it can become more attractive. So meanwhile, Brian, from your vantage point, do you see this as a possibly good thing or something that could be potentially problematic if China reopens a more and full based on the demand side for commodities, in particular crude and natural gas? Yeah, I think it's very difficult to try to identify silver linings from the situation, but there's no doubt that the China lockdown policies have had a disinflationary effect on global inflation. What inflation would have been worse over the summer, we would not have seen probably the decline in commodity prices where most of the disinflation we've seen so far has come from. And so if these policies stay in place because the",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1867,2022-11-22 14:23:20
19254," We're so the summer we would not have seen probably the decline in commodity prices where most of the disinflation we've seen so far has come from and so if these policies stay in place because the virus is still spreading there in a way that's unacceptable to the policy makers, I think all in all that's going to be disinflation. I think the initial fears where that this was going to disrupt manufacturing and cost supply chains to stay disrupted for longer. But two things are happening at the same time. One is companies are finding ways to to reroute around China and two I think more importantly global consumer demand for goods that are made entirely or partially in China is falling in its own right because people have rotated into services. So less of a big deal from a global economic perspective. A very big deal from a Chinese consumer perspective. But again, that is going to be putting some disinflationary pressure out there in the world, which is what really we need in 2023. Brian, before I let you go, I want to put you on the spot because one thing that I keep hearing about is that we're going to head back down to near 2% maybe in 2024, 2025. Do you think that that's true in terms of the inflation rate in the US and the developed world? Do you think that we're going to have it protracted higher inflation kind of regime for longer? So I think that, you know, it's going to be tough to get that last percent percent and a half down. I think all the forecasters are converging around 2.9 to 3.5% as the sort of the core PC inflation for next year. And that raises the question of whether the Fed is going to accept that and say, well, mission accomplished more or less. We've gotten the bulk of the inflation down. I think at the end of the day, the Fed will probably swerve and try to cut rates back down to avoid a recession. Once these risks become more balanced between leaving inflation in low 3s high 2s and risking a recession because you've kept policy restricted for so long. I think the Fed blinks in 2024 lowers the Fed funds rate and we live in a somewhat higher inflation world, although not one that's going to greatly bother people as long as wage growth is at least as high or higher than inflation, which I think in the positive scenario that we're expecting next year is going to be the case. Brian Nick, not a level. Thank you so much for being with us and happy Thanksgiving coming up.

It's only celebrating on Wall Street right now, keeping a cautious view due to the challenging macro environment and finally, bear downgrading Airbnb to neutral, expecting inflationary pressures to weigh on future bookings and leisure travel spending. Coming up, we've got the market opening up, Seifl Berry Bandister joining us. This is Bloomberg. A few days later, we'll be back in a few days. How much a group push have been seen from the Kishida government in terms of green funding? The Kishida administration has committed to doubling the amounts of investments in so-called green technologies. I think we need more than just more than just pronouncements. We need real money backing, very innovative startups, and innovative companies in this space. What do you make of Kishita's new capitalism? Well, I think he is framework is reflective of this challenges that Japan society is facing, namely, that growth has been present, but growth has not been, of course, evenly distributed. But frankly speaking, it's hard to redistribute income. If you don't have a income to begin with, if the government and private sector can work together and collaborate to drive more innovative growth startups, that that can really drive the income growth that the Kishita government needs to redistribute.

This after sales fall about 11% inflation but it's the outlook that's more positive. Comp sales coming in really outweighing that drop in sales plus negative color. Abercrombie also really really soaring up about 17% a narrow or lost 5% sales beat. They also posted a better sales forecast. This is a real hot and cold retail. But right now it seems like it's hot. Barry Bannister just talking about the short interest or the short squeeze out there that there's a high short interest on this stock that could be a piece of it.

Lisa your right hedge funds have been strangely MIA from this recent rally we have data from Jake Morgan tracking long short funds and they've paired back bets in both books after pretty much being forced to cover their shorts in this latest bounce you're looking at a basket of the most shorted stocks versus the S&P 500 as you can see it's pretty much the same chart almost there that's painful for some of these short sellers and that tepid risk appetite can also be seen in the options market let's look at open interest on both puts and calls it has been dropping over the past few weeks of course the trend is definitely higher versus this time last year but starting to have again just in the last month or so even with uncertainty building into year and at least we haven't even talked about crypto hedge funds could be looking at billions of dollars stuck at bankrupt exchange FTX we got a list of its 50 biggest creditors over the weekend more than three billion dollars owed that is just amazing now that list was redacted but we know there could be up to 150 crypto hedge funds with direct exposure Lisa and what the potential fall from that is the market and there is a lot of optimism now that the pace of rate increases is going to slow essential banks get a little bit more confident inflation is closer to a peak but that said you don't typically get markets reach your trough until interest rates actually start to come down we're still a long way away from that Limerick's Kayleigh lines is back with us Kayleigh 2022 has not been a pretty year for the equity market and it might not get prettier anytime soon granted it has gotten maybe less ugly over the last day month or so as inflation data has come and cooler than expected and we have seen somewhat of a rally the question is where do we go from here especially looking in to 2023 and still the S&P 500 is down about 17% year to date with of course losses far greater for tech stocks than Azdaq 100 is down more like 29% and of course that is a result of higher borrowing costs the 10 year yield is about 230 basis points higher today than it was at the start of 2022 and that of course is due to higher fed rate expectations that terminal rate continually getting reprised upward as the year has gone on now up to about 5.2% and we know that fed speakers like Jim Bullard,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1870,2022-11-22 14:36:28
19257," to higher fed rate expectations that terminal rate continually getting reprised upward as the year has gone on now up to about 5.2%. And we know that fed speakers like Jim Bullard in recent days have said there is even upside room from there and they might stay up there for a while. It is the higher rates for longer theme. And we have strategies after strategies saying until that changes and we actually get a pivot, it's going to be hard for risky assets to do well. Credit suites expecting muted equity performance in the first half of next year before we get past peak caucusionists. And then a better second half bank of America echoing something similar. They see a potential bottom in the first half and Marco Colonevic, what used to be the ultra bull over at JP Morgan says that and felt to tell the fed starts cutting rates assets will be range bound with a more pronounced downside risk. And that is pretty much consensus for the year. If you look at the average year and target for 2023 for Wall Street, 39 31 is what we're looking at. And where do we trade this morning, Lisa 39 66? Huge far cry. Kelly Lines. Thank you so much. Steve was very bad. Is there expecting a winter melt up to fall victim to a summer slump rating quote after an S&P 500 rally to 4,300 by April 2023. The feds overactivity now with longs and variable lags may just lock in a summer recession 2023. Anyway, Barry, I'm pleased to say joins us now. Barry, we just heard a whole host of bearishness. We just heard all these people even Marco Colonevic over at JP Morgan, starting to feel bearish. You think it's a little bit too much. Why? Yeah, we went into this year with a double digit first quarter expectation of a decline and we timed the three bottoms fairly well, but we did not time the two intermediate tops. You know, we had a top in the summer and June and we are August and we had another top after that after April before that. Our view has been that if you look at the market in real terms, which is really the only way to look at it inflation adjusted, the mean, the trend mean and the median of the 13 bear market surrounding recessions the past 90 years since World War II, it's 31%. And you know what? We fell that far 31% year to date through the October 16th low. So it is a little late to be a bear. We have to time the next recession. The market typically rolls over about one month before recession. It peaks maybe six months before, but you've noticed the roll over about one month before. And I don't see a recession the next six months. So we have a window of opportunity here for a rally, which we've been playing. So how much can you play that? I mean, do you play that within specific companies based on earnings, based on forward looks? Or do you base that just simply on evaluation? No, these are we look, you know, we view it as a trade off between really two major groups, cyclical and defensive. And so within cyclical having been dominated by defenses year to date, within cyclical or we do feel like the financials, even the semiconductors tech hardware, housing, which is technically making a double bottom and looks like it would be the biggest beneficiary of a narrowing of fixed rate mortgage spreads, which are really blown out versus what they should be. And retailers if oil comes down, so we have to watch oil really, really closely, but retail would benefit if oil comes down. And those are the ones we would play as cyclical over defensive small caps are included in that more cyclical profile. And that's where we have been in the last few months. When you talk about small caps, the argument for a lot of people was that the U.S. was doing the best at all the world's biggest economies and that it would remain so. And it would also remain immunized from the strong dollar and the potential deteriorating effect on business outside of the U.S. That story is shifting as people talk about peak dollar, as people talk about Europe doing better, perhaps next year and China as well, resurgent. How much do you buy that that will be a new narrative where small caps will not do well next year? Well, it's specific to Europe and not so much small caps inside the U.S. and Europe are sort of two different questions, but specifically to Europe, I have been impressed with the fact that they've been able to adjust to a much higher average energy cost and higher labor costs. Europe is very much a coiled spring, poised to rise as the dollar tops. And I do think the dollar is topping. So I like international investing. Small cap is an",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1871,2022-11-22 14:40:38
19258," Very much a coil spring, hoist to rise as the dollar tops. And I do think the dollar is topping. So I like international investing. Small cap is another beta play on this kind of cyclical theme. But international looks particularly interesting to me. And I'll be spending a lot more time on that. I plan to the next three months. With respect to China, are you also one of those who thinks that that holds a great degree of opportunity just simply because of what we've debated into valuations so far? China will eventually reopen. OK, there have been some issues regarding their handling of COVID, having lacked mRNA vaccines and not purchased US and European made vaccines, which might have emulated some of their problems. But China will reopen. It will be abolished for global GDP. It will be bullish for cyclicals when it occurs. So I am thinking that they're inching towards that. But over the course of the winter, when virus cases typically surge in the northern hemisphere, I would be a little more circumspect that maybe the punch from China will occur more towards the summer and not so much immediately in the winter months. Barry, we're talking about companies and how much they can be resilient into next year. And we're getting a slew of earnings, particularly in the retail sector today, at Bacrobian Fitch, Dick Sporting Goods, a whole host of others, and it continues to show resilience. People are spending. People have the ability to do so. And they're upgrading some of their forecasts. What do you make of the optimism, the strange optimism, based on expectations in retail that we've seen so far today? Well, it's not so much a strange, in the sense that because of pandemic savings combined with enormous government spending facilitated by the Fed and handouts to individuals and businesses, we built up $2.5 trillion of cash that hasn't led down in the last several months to the high ones, so like 1.7 trillion of cash. People have the money to spend. They grumble about the inflation, but they have the money to spend. And that is help keep the retail sales off. I expect that to continue. So what do you think will be the returns, Barry? Just to sort of sum up here heading into a tumultuous 2023. What kind of equity returns can investors expect next year, the year after, perhaps over the next five years on average? I think most of the returns will be made in the first half, particularly through about April 30th. I tend to be on the cautious side. I'm looking at about 9% or 10% upside for the S&P. Obviously more for the higher beta or the small cap trade. But I do see the direction is up. The recession risk is more late summer into the fall. And since a recession is a meaningful cross the board decline in income production sales, employment, and fixed investment, we have some spotty weakness there. But no one can adequately explain that we're actually having weakness across the board in those areas, particularly on the employment side. So we'll see the economy hold up at least into through the second quarter. We'll see about third quarter. That is some risk there. Barry Vanister, are you sticking with us as we parse through how to navigate? Coming up, the crisis in crypto deepens. What how far is the reach? I think the next leg of this is going to be, wow, what happens to the economy? You start looking at the amount of money that was being spent by even FTX on advertising. Crypto is a whole. That conversation coming up next right now, we are seeing a bit of a gain as we see at the first 12 minutes of trading, pairing though a bit, 2.10 of a percent gain, 39.58 and I'm going to ask if he has a fever. One covers the world like Bloomberg.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1872,2022-11-22 14:44:54
19259," No one covers the world like Bloomberg. My team thinks 2023. We avoid a recession. I'm a little more skeptical about that. China and the US both do not want to see nuclear force in the European continent. The regulators here in the Bahamas are ongoing with their investigation into ATIAC. With unmatched reach in resources from more than 120 countries, the moment news breaks 24 hours a day. Bloomberg, your global business authority. My grandfather got into the mutual fund business because the average investor could not get a diversified stock portfolio. And it was too dangerous to put your entire savings in it just a couple of companies. So the mutual fund was created to give a diversified expert management at a reasonable price. Today, we have a phenomenon where companies are waiting much longer to go public. And so in 2000, the average company went public after three years. Now, companies are waiting nine to ten years because there's so much money available in the private markets. As a matter of fact, there are half the number of public companies that there were in 2000. And there's five times the number of private equity back companies. So just from an investable universe, you look at the private markets and it's, you know, significantly bigger. So the question is that return that used to be captured in the public markets is now captured in the private markets. But the problem is, you know, is you're really tied up for a long time when you invest in a private equity fund. And so trying to figure out a way to solve the same problem on my grandfather was trying to solve, which is how do you bring those returns responsibly? The democratization of the private markets to the retail investors. And I describe it as a bit of like running the scissors. This is a great tool if you use it appropriately. And so we're focused on trying to figure out responsibly bringing it into the average investor. How did Jeff Bezos realize you could sell anything on the internet? The web was growing at something like 2300% a year. Anything growing that fast is going to be big. Why did Bill Gates create control all the lead? Kind of become the poster child of, hey, couldn't you have made this stuff a little simpler? And what inspired Diane von Furstenberg to create the rap dress? The rap dress created move. On the David Rubenstein show, I uncover the untold stories of the world's most successful leaders, right here on Bloomberg. I think the next leg of this is going to be, wow, what happens to the economy? Start looking at the amount of money that was being spent by even FTX on advertising. Crypto is a whole. I think this is going to feed into the economy. I think the wealth effect is real, right? This time we've lost $3 trillion down to just under a trillion. Academies, Peter Chir, expecting further contagion from the crypto crisis. The follow continuing with yet another brokerage sounding the alarm, Genesis. Looking at to raise funds, selling Bloomberg in a statement, our goal is to resolve the current situation consensually without the need for any bankruptcy filing. Genesis continues to have constructive conversations with creditors, as coming as FTX is expected to make. It's first appearance in a Delaware bankruptcy court today. Bloomberg, Shnally Vasek has been covering all of this and breaking the news. Shnally, thank you so much for being with us. What's the latest here at understanding where we are in the crypto follow? Lisa, I want to bring us inside those continuing conversations as it pertains to Genesis. Because as we've reported, they have reached out to a lot of players, larger and smaller, to try to really feel that $1 billion whole as it pertains to Genesis lending. Now, in the six days since they've holstered with drawlisons last week, they have sought $1 billion or more afresh capital, and they've worn those investors as we've reported that they would have to file for bankruptcy without new funds. Now, the reason Genesis matters so much to this industry, of course, is because it has a lot of institutional backing behind this from a lot of institutional counter parties. So all of a sudden, you are seeing that crypto contagion start to become a bigger issue potentially if you saw bankruptcy filing from Genesis. Now, let's talk about FTX because, of course, in a couple hours here, we have FTX starting at bankruptcy hearing in Delaware courts, regulators around the world, and its own customers are very interested in what will happen here. You do have a lot of detail already out there, more than 1 billion of cash that could be a play here.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1873,2022-11-22 14:49:22
19260," Regulators around the world and its own customers are very interested in what will happen here. You do have a lot of detail already out there, more than 1 billion of cash. That could be a play here. They have hired an investment bank, Prello Weinberg, to seek potential asset sales as well as recapitalizations of certain assets. And we know that they have the largest 50 creditors have billions at play here. The top 10 creditors, even more than that, tens of millions to 100 millions of dollars per counterparty at risk at FTX. Now who gets their money back? Because at the end of the day, if you have 40,000 bucks with FTX, do you get anything? Do you have any sense of recouping even a portion of those funds? Or is the money safe for the big guys here? This will all play out in real time. We have never seen a bankruptcy like this before. But can anything of the past from prior financial bankruptcies play any role here? Wanted to just point out the contagion here. You're a bond girl. I'm a bond girl. Coinbase, of course, is not wrapped up in any of this. Yet their bonds are trading at just over 50 cents on the dollar for nose maturing after 2030 here. Why? This is a company with $5 billion on its balance sheet. It is publicly traded. It is regulated in the United States. So you are seeing investor fears roll over a little more. How long that lasts for won't be answered until some of this shakes out? Chennai-Boss, a great work, really interesting there about Coinbase, given some skepticism about what other companies might have to become insolvent or face some sudden and serious pressures. Joining us, Barry Bannister of Steffel, who has been arguing that the crisis in crypto is more contained, writing, quote, there is wealth destruction mainly the 20 to 30-something crowd who fell under the spell of decentralized finance and didn't understand the history of financial mania. As Barry Bannister still with us, is that what you would call this? A financial mania that is bursting? Well, I think obviously, Blackchain has tremendous potential and decentralized finance is one means to get there. But as I do, I spend a lot of time on financial history. If you look back in the past, for example, the Wildcat banks of the 19th century, many of these banks that were not regulated adequately failed. And so what's going to happen right now is they're going to have their moment of failure. They've got co-mingling of their own trading accounts with customer accounts, which is absolutely verboten in the traditional finance industry. And they need to be subject to those rules. They need SEC regulation. But once they get that, there are a lot of great potential outcomes in the DeFi industry. But the good thing about DeFi is they held themselves out as separate and so they're not as connected to the rest of us. And there's not a lot of spillover other than the wealth effects. Well, but what about the brokerages, right? The company is like Coinbase. Like even the Wall Street banks that have built out trading desks, specifically for crypto assets, that might not be a part of the decentralized finance kind of world, but something that is more of a speculative instrument. Have we seen the entirety of that fallout? Well, as you know, after the Dodd-Frank Act, crop trading pretty much went away. So the exposure of the capital accounts of Wall Street banks is minimal because the trading activity is not going to spill over. But yeah, there's wealth destruction and it does have a small... I think that we've lost a very banister of it, Steve. Thank you so much for that. We have been talking about banks really being immunized because of how much capital they've had to hold and some of the new regulatory actions that have been passed post 2008. Let's get to Abigail Toulittle, who's looking at some sector price action this morning. Abby, what do you see? Well, Lisa, you know, it's really interesting business. We do have stocks off their highs up 3, 10 to 1%. Would you be surprised to know that is on volume? That is 32% below the 20-day average. Of course not. It's Thanksgiving weeks. Of course, it's very small moves here relative to the volume. But some bigger moves for some sectors, including energy on oils, bounce back up 1.3%. We also have utilities up 1.2% with yields going down. Those dividends look better, clipping to the bottom of that board. Tech, though, interesting yields down is also lower. Those three mega-cap sectors probably has to do with China tech still weighing through to US tech.

I think there are probably parts that you could hold on to I think the main challenge which Japan faces is Demography the population is declining rapidly aging Women are totally underused in the labor force especially educated women One needs to think about increasing immigration These are issues that Abe tried to address but a lot more needs to be done to quote unquote revitalize Japan I Now for the trading diary you need to be watching this week before we get there We are seeing a lift in the S&P interesting the Nasdaq has lost him down about a third of a percent the Russell up about 20 20 basis points for looking also at bond yields coming in just as much as we look at some stability there after a really tumultuous year Taking a look at that 10-year yield we started the year at 1 and a half percent 3.77% now the White House briefing We are things that we are watching today 11.30 a.m. Fed speak continuing with master bullard and George all on Debt for today fed minutes out on Wednesday followed by a host of data the data game dump including initial jobless claims new home sales US PMIs and the University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey and finally US markets are closing for the Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday Good luck with Friday at kinds of office activity as a time to clean up the office or just take time off in the United States,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1875,2022-11-22 14:58:03

Pepsi's number fever campaign in the Philippines has probably gone down in history as one of the biggest marketing disasters in history mainly because of a human error that led Pepsi to print more winning caps than they planned. The resulting chaos caused riots, civil unrest and even deaths. Reporting this story took over a year and it resulted in me flying to Manila in the Philippines to meet unlucky winners and to find out exactly what happened back then in the 1990s. My name is Jeff Mesh. I'm a journalist based in Los Angeles. I wrote the story for Bloomberg Business Week about Pepsi's number fever campaign. The Philippines is a really interesting country. It's made up of thousands of other countries.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1876,2022-11-22 15:02:14
19263," three, four Bloomberg Business Week about Pepsi's number fever campaign. The Philippines is a really interesting country. It's made up of thousands of islands. And it's also a country that's very heavily influenced by America. American culture is everywhere you look in the Philippines. They're obsessed with Frank Sinatra music, for example. They love all things America, and that extends to their love for soft drinks. Pepsi Cola, Coca Cola. In the 1990s, it was everywhere. Pepsi and Coca Cola were embroiled in what is now known as the Cola Wars. It was a fierce battle for market dominance. Number fever was already a really popular promotion. It had been rolled out in America to great success. And so Pepsi decided to roll it out internationally, particularly in Asia. They thought it was the answer to their problems. They thought it could finally help them beat their biggest competitor. Internet, I want a watch! Look for the winning number in five times for a seven-day Alphan TV, and your new super, you could be a millionaire. A million pesos or six-j-eight thousand dollars doesn't sound like a lot now. But in 1992, that was a phenomenal amount of money. You've got to remember that in the Philippines at the time, the average monthly income was about a hundred dollars. So a million pesos was wealth beyond anyone's wildest imaginations. Number fever caught fire in the Philippines. Kids were saving up their pocket money to buy a bottle of Pepsi. Parents were squirreling away all of the bottle caps in bags. You would walk down the street and people were going through trash trying to find discarded bottle caps. It was a national phenomenon. Pepsi boasted that half the population of the Philippines was playing it. Number fever boosted Pepsi sales every month from ten million dollars to fourteen million dollars. It had a huge impact on Pepsi's bottom line. Number fever quickly became number hysteria. Mades were being jailed for stealing their employer's winning bottle caps. There was even some murders over winning bottle caps. People were fighting in the streets over these caps. There were signs that there were going to be problems with number fever very early. Pepsi had rolled out the competition in Chile and a garbled fax had caused some kind of problem with the winning number. They'd announced the wrong one in Chile causing riots. There were signs that there could be big problems ahead if they didn't keep their eye on the ball. So in 1992 Pepsi decided to extend the campaign in the Philippines and they announced that the competition would go on for a few more weeks. One night on the television news they announced the latest winning number. Three, four, nine. The problem was three, four, nine had already been allocated as a non-winning number in earlier campaigns. So there were literally hundreds of thousands of bottle caps with three, four, nine just floating around the Philippines. Hundreds of thousands of people all across the Philippines, thousands of islands were finding winning bottle caps. Three, four, nine, three, four, nine. Some people had ten lucky three, four, nine bottle caps. People were dancing in the streets celebrating. They thought their problems were over. They were millionaires. It's still not certain exactly how many winners there were of lucky three, four, nine bottle caps. But we know that Pepsi printed over 600,000 of them. Pepsi realized very early that there was a problem. Hundreds of people started arriving at their bottling plants with their lucky bottle caps. They realized something was seriously wrong. Pepsi tried to solve the problem by offering a small token donation to anyone that brought a lucky bottle cap to their bottling plant. But it wasn't enough. People didn't want just a handful of pesos.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1877,2022-11-22 15:06:39
19264," token donation to anyone that brought a lucky bottle cap to their bottling plan. But it wasn't enough. People didn't want just a handful of pesos. People wanted their million pesos prize. Within a year, violent protests and riots outside Pepsi factories would leave dozens injured and five people dead. At one Pepsi factory in the Philippines, a grenade was thrown through the window. It killed three Pepsi employees. Anacita Rosario was a schoolteacher living near Manila in the Philippines. She was one of the tragic victims of this whole thing. She was walking to a nearby store to buy some rice one day when a Molotov cocktail was thrown at a Pepsi truck in a violent protest. It bounced under the truck and exploded. It killed her and an innocent bystander who was just a child and injured many others. When I was in the Philippines, I tracked down Anacita's daughter, Cindy and her husband, Raoul. It was clear to me that they were still very upset by the whole thing. You know, a family had been ripped apart by this competition and Raoul told me that he'd never remarried. He told me that he'd gone to meet Pepsi executives after his wife was killed. And he was angry. He said to them, you know, this wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for you, if it wasn't for number fever. The biggest revelation from my reporting was rumors that Pepsi was somehow involved in bombing their own trucks. I found a newspaper report with a headline that said, Pepsi goons bomb their own trucks. And when I visited the MBI, the police department in the Philippines, they presented me with documents and interviews with people who claimed that Pepsi had paid them to cause riots and to cause trouble outside their plants in order to destabilize the situation and to frame the owners of the coalitions that were fighting them to try and curry favor. I just thought that was so shocking and of course Pepsi denied it, but how bizarre that a company would be accused of bombing their own trucks. The contest had sparked so much anger in the Philippines because it landed at just this really weird time in the Philippines history. It was during a crazy election that was racked with allegations of fraud. The Philippines was in a kind of love-hate relationship with America. They loved obviously the American aid and finances that was pouring into the country, but at the same time they yearned for independence. They wanted to be their own country. Vicente Del Fiero was a local preacher living in Manila and he hated the number fever campaign. Del Fiero thought Pepsi's number fever campaign was just one of the many ways that America was asserting its dominance over a third world country. He hated seeing his fellow countrymen get ripped off in his eyes by this huge multinational American company. He wanted justice. Del Fiero rounded up over 800 winners of three, four, nine bottle caps and he got them all together to sue Pepsi for over $400 million to be divided between those holders of lucky bottle caps. Del Fiero took money from some of the people who could afford it. They paid him 500 pesos to help with legal fees, but for people who couldn't afford the money he would just represent them pro bono.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1878,2022-11-22 15:10:49
19265," Well, he had mounted that on that damn bone, the bone of the neck. He didn't let it. He flew to America and he hired two consumer lawyers here in America to take on Pepsi. He had a meeting at Pepsi's headquarters to try and resolve the problem. But he said he wanted to take it all the way to the highest courts in America. When those cases were heard in America, those courts decided that this was a problem that should be heard in the Philippines, not in America. Back in the Philippines, Delphiero continued his case in the Filipino courts. At one stage, there were arrest warrants handed out for nine Pepsi-Cola executives, which he saw as a big victory. We don't know if those arrest warrants were ever upheld, but it made newspaper headlines across the country. Pepsi did not take kindly to Delphiero's campaign. They tried everything to shut him down. They sued him for libel. My father had to attend three times a month for a branch, one for the fight. And another heating for the branch, one for the evening, also three times a month. Also, there was a time my father's hospital, who would do heart failure, still had to attend the two branch heating of otherwise, for not attending the judge will issue water to the next month's father. My father passed away January 13, 2010. After staying for almost one year in the hospital, he died of complications due to heart failure. After the death of my father, I was inspired to do the website. Pepsi could be remembered for what they did to the consumer in the Philippines and to my father. When I reached out to Pepsi for comment for this story, they claimed that they didn't have access to anyone who was working at Pepsi that was around in those days. They also said that during COVID-19, they didn't have access to their documents about this. But, you know, they were very careful to say that they were sorry for everything that happened. And we do know that Pepsi did try everything to try and make this right. The Pepsi number fever disaster cost the company millions. We know that they paid up to $10 million in those good-will payments. But the financial effect could be much greater. After the disaster, we know that Pepsi sales dipped. They were overtaken by Coca-Cola again. Pepsi's number fever disaster changed the legacy of that soft drink in the Philippines forever. Some people of certain age won't touch it. For many people, Pepsi is a taboo word. A lot of the people that I spoke to were still quite traumatized by their experience. By that experience of winning a million pesos, losing it and then returning to their normal life in poverty in Manila. When the news of the farming came out, it was a massive story in Germany. We are following some breaking news coming to us out of Dortmund in Germany. It was covered by all the media outlets. Three roadside explosions triggered at the same time last night as the coach left its hotel in the south of Dortmund. Public figures commented on it. The toll wasия, the furthest from last night. The India Gundam did that, and had to get through there and definitely do it last but not last but still.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1879,2022-11-22 15:15:20
19266," Three roadside explosions triggered at the same time last night as the coach left its hotel in the south of Dortmund. Public figures commented on it. We should not let them affect our life wherever it was. The media echo went far beyond Dortmund. I think it was front page news and every single big paper around Europe. Everyone thought of like a terrorist attack and people were scared that throughout the city in Dortmund there was more attacks to be happening. We've been asked to investigate just after the bomb went off and the players of the team were shell shocked. The person who had mastered my attack was actually sitting in the hotel eating steak and sweet potatoes. My name is Thomas Rogers. I'm the journalist who wrote the article The Get Rich Quick Scheme that nearly killed a German soccer team. Dortmund is a mid-sized city in the western part of Germany in a state called North Rhine Westphalia. It's a former industrial city that's kind of fallen on hard times in the last few decades. It was severely bombed in the war so the center of the city is quite stark. Some of the few high points include its soccer team. My name is Aikening. I'm a reporter with Bloomberg News and I'm a great fan of Boris J. Dortmund. Dortmund fans are super loyal. On all match days the entire city is in black and yellow. It's like a religion. I think more than most German cities, soccer does play a very large role in the identity of Dortmund. In October of 2000 the BBB became the first team in the Bundesliga to actually go public. Salaries for soccer players in the Bundesliga have gone up very dramatically. With such high prices they thought that by going public they would be able to compete better with big teams like Bayern Munich. Unfortunately that didn't go too well. Dortmund bought too many expensive players, high wages and the club almost went bust in 2005. The price of their shares it has sometimes gone up but mostly gone down since they made that decision. So on April 11th 2017 the team was staying in a hotel on the outskirts of Dortmund. Match days are always special in Dortmund. Everyone is looking forward to it. The team always meets in the same hotel ahead of matches. They stayed in this hotel in order to have a kind of neutral space before games so that they could concentrate, be isolated from distractions, things like that. Everyone was pretty optimistic they had a chance to go really far maybe into the finals. I was in the office and getting ready for match day. I was going to meet with a friend, a fellow Dortmund supporter in the pub. Es always, the fans are very excited about matches. On that day they were heading to play in the quarter final against AS Monaco at Signal Uduna Stadium which is in the centre of Dortmund. Shortly before 7pm the players of the team boarded their official team bus. When the bus took off the parking lot of the hotel and turned on the street there were three detonations, three bombs that exploded and hit the bus off Dortmund. Three explosions occurred close to the Borussia Dortmund team bus. The B team bus had just left the hotel. The explosions destroyed two windows in the rear part of the bus. People screamed, people jumped to the ground. The fellow Dortmund fan I was supposed to watch match with. He called me and said, turn on the TV there was an attack of the Dortmund bus and I thought he was like, there was impossible. Some of the players screamed at the driver to keep driving as fast as possible because they were worried that people might storm the bus. German investigators say the explosive devices used in the attack on the Borussia Dortmund bus contained metal pins and the one had pierced a seat headrest.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1880,2022-11-22 15:19:42
19267," Say the explosive devices used in the attack on the Borussia Dortmund bus contained metal pins and the one had pierced a seat headrest. Unbeknownst to the team members, the actual mastermind behind the attack was as they were disembarking the bus, was actually eating steak and sweet potatoes at the hotel, they had just left. Authorities are attempting to verify a letter left at the scene claiming jihadists were behind the attack. Because there had been a series of attacks by Islamic terrorists in Germany and Europe, there was a widespread suspicion in the media that this was another Islamic terror attack. Three letters were found at the site of the bombing that took credit for the attack on behalf of Islamic State. There were however reasons to doubt this particular narrative. Would actually be a surprise if ISIS were actually part of this attack. Possibly could be employed by other groups like the Far Right wing to try and shift the blame. The letters had some strange qualities. They were written in a strange German that used big sophisticated words but had basic grammar mistakes as if someone was native German speaker but pretending to be a foreign person. Federal investigators have detained one man suspected of links to Islamist terrorism, one of two suspects whose apartments were rated this morning. Shortly after the bombing, a man in Austria named Rudolf who was a big BVB fan, he noticed that something strange was going on on the stock market related to the team's shares. He emailed the lawyers of BVB who then forwarded that email onto investigators. The email stated that someone had bought 60,000 BVB put options, a wager that the value of the shares of the team would fall below a certain amount at a certain date. I would someone buy that ahead of a match and then three bombs go off. Something is right here. For the person to make money off of that, it required the stock to go down quite a bit in a fairly short period of time and it wouldn't just be the team losing a match, it would require something much bigger than that. There was another big red flag about this purchase which is the fact that it had actually been made. Number one on the day of the bombing but also from an IP address that had been traced to the actual hotel where the bombing had taken place. When three explosions targeted the bus, carrying the Borussia Dortmund footballers on April 11th, written notes left at the scene claimed the attack was the work of ISIL. The truth, as is now alleged, is remarkable. On April 21st, the police arrested a man in a southern German city called Tubing and it was on his way to work and his name was Sergei Bina God. He seemed like an unlikely suspect because he had no known connections to the Islamic terror world. He didn't seem like a far-right extremist, he didn't seem like a left-wing extremist either. He seemed to be a completely unremarkable young man. A 28-year-old German Russian man named only a Sergei W stayed in the same hotel as the players on the night before the bombing. He specifically requested an up-a-room overlooking the bushes where the explosive devices were hidden. The media dissected why he would do that, what was his past. He had been inspired by the 2015 terror attack in Paris and he noticed that in the aftermath of the attack the stocks of French companies went down and he believed that if an attack took place that was directed at a specific company that the decrease in stock price for that company would be even more dramatic. It never occurred to anyone that someone would do that out of greed. We now know that the suspect bought three different derivatives on the Borziah Dortmund shares. With all these derivatives he bet on falling shares. The suspect bought the majority of these financial products on the 11th of April, the day of the attack. If the plot had been complete and successful and the stock had reached a value of 0, inner gold would have made up to 570,000 euros.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1881,2022-11-22 15:23:59
19268," Value of zero, intergold would have made up to 570,000 euros or the equivalent of about $608,000. Ultimately, the plan completely backfired. The attacker, Sege Venigold, didn't make any money, in fact, he lost money. In court, he would be extremely quiet. He usually kept his hands clasped together. One of the lawyers actually commented that he had never seen a defendant act so calmly. Venigold had served some time in the German military. From that information and from online research, he was able to figure out how to assemble remote, detonated bombs that would do what he hoped to do. There were a few days of extremely emotional testimony, including the soccer players who described doubting whether or not they could ever play another game again. It brought everything back up and it didn't quite help them to kind of process what was going on. Throughout it all, he sat there completely silent. The big mystery that was swirling around the trial was the question of why he may have simply done it because he wanted to impress a woman. Rebecca is a young woman who has a very troubled home life. She ultimately sees her relationship with Venigold as an opportunity to leave that troubled home. Venigold is a Russian immigrant to Germany. He speaks with an accent. He has anxiety in large groups of Germans. She begins to resent the fact that he has these fears and feels a little bit trapped. Rebecca attempts to dump him on multiple occasions and he threatens to commit suicide if she leaves him. Venigold apparently told Rebecca that she would soon be seeing a surprise. After being dumped via text message, he apparently began planning for this attack in earnest. Venigold was charged with 28 counts of attempted murder, which carried a maximum sentence in Germany of life in prison. He claimed that he had nothing to do with the attack, but as time went on, he admitted that he had actually been the person who had built the explosives and had set them on. But he claimed that he didn't want to actually kill anybody. Ultimately, Venigold didn't receive the harshest possible sentence. He was given 14 years in prison, but it's still a considerable amount in jail in Germany. The threat of an asteroid hitting Earth is very real. If it's big enough, it's also very final. These are very, very infrequent events. The probability is not zero though. A blinding flash of light streaking across the sky. About 100 tons of space rock falls on Earth every day. Most of it is so small it burns up in our atmosphere or lands unnoticed away from major populations. No human in the past thousand years is known to have been killed by a meteorite. And according to NASA, no large object is likely to strike the Earth any time in the next several hundred years. However, one thing is certain. We haven't found them all. There are thousands out there. We don't want to.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1882,2022-11-22 15:28:18
19269," However, one thing is certain, we haven't found them all. There are thousands out there and we don't know where they are. There are a lot of asteroids in our solar system. They number in the billions. Scientists all over the world are working toward detecting and deflecting the most catastrophic of natural disasters. The reasons aren't to find as many of these objects as we can. Yes, we are calculating whether or not an asteroid is potentially dangerous or not. I think it's something worth investing in. It's our existence that's safe. Amy, let's get this one out of the way. It's probably the question you get asked the most, but how scared should we be? Astroids and comets are a natural hazard that's out there like a lot of other natural hazards. These are very, very infrequent events, these collision events where an object actually impacts the Earth. The most important thing that we need to know about asteroids is when the next impact is going to happen. And how bad it will be. What we know is that an object that's about a kilometer across is capable of causing very, very wide devastation across the planet. Really, truly global devastation. The object that wiped out the dinosaurs was somewhere in the neighborhood of 5 to 10 kilometers across, so even bigger than that. At a kilometer, it's still going to be very bad and will have global effects. For objects that are capable of causing what I would call sort of regional damage, kind of a large major metropolitan area, a city in its surrounding environment, sort of around 100-ish meters. It depends on the details of the proposition and so forth. By the 1980s, NASA was cataloging near-Earth objects. In 1994, stargazers watched as comet shoemaker Levy 9 hit Jupiter. The resulting zone of chaos was estimated to be as large as the Earth, and the event became a turning point in the search for asteroids and comets in our solar system. In 1998, Congress tasked NASA with finding 90% of asteroids and comets 1 kilometer wide or larger. Soon after, Hollywood blockbusters Armageddon and Deep Impact brought attention and fear to the masses. The great news is that the vast majority, more than 90% of all of the really large 1 kilometer near-Earth objects have been found. The challenge now is working down to these smaller sizes that are still quite capable of causing a lot of damage, but they're just harder to spot because they're fainter, they're smaller. Can you give us a sense of how many are out there in our solar system? We know that there are a lot of asteroids in our solar system. They number in the billions. Most of them, however, are between Mars and Jupiter in what we call the main asteroid belt. This is a region of space where most of the asteroids in the inner part of our solar system live, and they stay there for many billions of years. There is another population, though, that kind of leaks inward and gets into the region somewhat close to the Earth. And we call these near-Earth objects. We think that there are millions and millions of near-Earth objects that are out there in the total population. As of today, we know of sort of around 20, 25,000, something like that. When we first spot an object, we really know very little about it. We just see something moving across the sky. So all you get is just sort of a handful of snapshots, just enough to be able to tell that this isn't an asteroid that we've already seen before. And then once we can calculate the distance to it, we can now start to make predictions about its true size. Is it large or is it small? So we have a lot of information that we have to get pretty quickly to really understand what's going on. Finding asteroids is just one piece of the puzzle. Planetary scientists are extremely skilled in determining the orbits and speeds of asteroids based on relatively small amounts of data. NASA runs simulations of the trajectories asteroids could take, which is useful, but time-consuming. A team of scientists in the Netherlands have found a way that could buy us more time. Our methods are really quick. So you can...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1883,2022-11-22 15:32:47
19270," A team of scientists in the Netherlands have found a way that could buy us more time. Our methods is very quick. So you can very quickly get an assessment of whether or not the objects is danger or not. If you look at the classical way of determining the danger of an asteroid, it may take days of computing time on very big machines to determine this hazardousness. The current problem is that there's just too many asteroids out there to spend a huge amount of computational power on all of them. So the neural network allows us to focus on what really could go and pose a hazards earth. A neural network is a computing system that mimics the way the human brain operates to find underlying relationships in a set of data. By training the network in this way, you train it in recognizing those objects that are most likely to hit the planet. And once it's trained, you can apply this network to all the unknown asteroids. And then you can make a selection and saying, hey, this is these are the ones which appear to be having orbits similar to the ones which we know are hitting the planet. It doesn't mean that they do, but it does. It only means that they look very similar to once we know they do. What else did you find? Should we be particularly concerned about anything? One thing that we did find is that our neural network was able to go and identify a handful of asteroids, which weren't considered potentially hazardous, that when we went into greater than four in time, they came quite close to Earth. We find a handful, which were not detected before or not considered being dangerous before. And we think they are potentially dangerous. It's very hard to simulate. And going forward in time and asteroid that's going to hit Earth because what the Earth is really small. And what space is really big. And then you have to have very exact parameters to shoot an asteroid that goes and hits exactly. And then Simon had the ingenious idea of not even trying to do that and just launching the asteroids from Earth's surface and integrating backwards in time. It's very hard to make it hit. So you need a lot of calculations which all end up in nothing. And the idea was then like, well, let's not do that. This is basically what NASA is doing. NASA is taking an asteroid making multiple copies of them, shooting them all forwards in time, calculating their orbits. And then you see what fraction sort of gets close to Earth. Not even hitting Earth, but getting close to Earth. And then they call it a potential impactor. So you calculate the solar system forward in time for let's say a thousand years. And then you launch asteroids from the surface as if they if you go forward in time would fall on the surface. You calculate them backwards to today. And then you get your orbital parameters of today's asteroid, which you know will land on the planet. And those you can use as known impactors and compare this all the other asteroids in the solar system. Consimulations and AI can those things fill in the gaps where perhaps telescopes and other imaging tools can't absolutely since the observations get more complex. The physics gets more complex and if the physics get more complex, the mathematics becomes more complex. And at some point you can't solve your problems analytically anymore. And then this where the computer comes in. Now we have this trained neural network. We have a way of calculating in a fraction of a seconds, whether or not an asteroid is potentially dangerous or not. And therefore deserves more attention or more time to spend on for for redefining our capabilities dangerous. When it comes to hunting asteroids, time is critical. What we can do about a potentially hazardous object depends a great deal on what we know about it. And how much time we have before the encounter. We really like to find them when they're decades away. Because the more time you have, the more options you have. And the less energy it takes to move an object aside. It also means we might not have to resort to launching a nuclear warhead as an asteroid. Until recently, pretty much our only choice. That's an option of last resort in my opinion, yes. We have lots of options available. You can simply opt into the object and just nudge it out of a way. That's one possibility. And that's kind of in a way the sort of the simplest thing to think about just nudge it off its path a little bit with a massive object.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1884,2022-11-22 15:37:08
19271," The object and just nudge it out of the way, that's one possibility, and that's kind of in a way the sort of the simplest thing to think about just nudging it off its path a little bit with you know a massive object, a spacecraft one so it's kind of like bowling if you will, you know if you have a long time or a long stretch of runway in the lane, just a very small twist on the bowling ball will make a big change in where it ultimately ends up. Another option it would be something where you take a very big big massive spacecraft and you park it next to the object and you use the force of gravity as a towing rig that takes longer though and you need to be able to send a pretty massive spacecraft and obviously depends a lot on how big the asteroid is. Other options start to get more and more complicated and they range from painting one side of the object of white color and painting the other side dark and letting the pressure of light sort of perturb its orbit. In a departure from the lab and computer simulations NASA has real plans to rehearse kinetic impact deflection. In 2021 the agency will launch Dart, the double asteroid redirection test mission which will intercept a 160 meter asteroid in 2022. Better to practice now before we have to deal with an actual threat. In the meantime discovering asteroids is our best bet. Thousands of scientists and amateur astronomers around the world make up an informal network that surveyed the heavens but that may not be enough. NASA wants more resources to map our solar system and better technology. We need to ramp up our network of sensors and also we need to just continue to strengthen our network of international observers so that we can get follow up because we find these objects when they're distributed all over the late sky. Once we get more observations we get better data we can make better predictions. If you look at the big impactors we have had in the last let's say 20 years or maybe 30 years or 50 years. Most of them we haven't seen coming so the danger, the real danger I think comes from the objects we don't know about and not from the objects we do know about. This particular natural disaster like a lot of natural disasters and like climate change is a problem with the global commas so the thing that we risk collectively is that it sort of then becomes nobody's problem and nobody takes our ship over it. Asteroids are all over the sky. They just truly cross boundaries and borders with a seconds notice. They're kind of imagining the future. Maybe he wants a small satellites around the earth that are always going and looking outward. I mean I think it's something worth investing in. It's our existence at stake, right? The pandemic has affected everyone in different ways. Some passed the time by baking. Home made sourdough bread. Do I need to say more? Some chose to binge watch Netflix. It's okay. Or maybe you started a garden oasis in your backyard. Next I'm going to put my letsys in. But for millions of others I'm going to be posting stocks that will boom.

19272," for $3 million. I want some free money. I don't think you can overstate the online communities of social media influence on financial markets. A large group of inexperienced investors who discuss their plans on social media platform Reddit have shaken up the stock market in a big way. The stock that everybody's talking about right now is GameStop. Video game retailer GameStop has set to continue their head spinning ascent today. The revolutionaries on Reddit are spanking Wall Street's ass. The more these stocks go up, the more the big guys are getting creamed and losing billions of dollars. This isn't a wealthy person's game anymore. Anyone can play it. I took up a little bit of a new hobby and I'm interested in day trading. As an investor nowadays, you don't have to look a specific way. You don't have to wear specific clothes. You don't have to be doing it from a trading floor on Wall Street in like a high-rise building in downtown Manhattan. The narrative of what's driving the markets is no longer being held in secret offices in New York and Boston of privileged people talking to other privileged people. It's right out in the open. It's on Twitter. It's on Reddit. From brokerage apps to discord channels and subreddits to TikTok influencers. One of the last holdouts in the world of disruption, finance is next in line. Investing should be as you pick with us as shopping online. That's Vlad Tenev, the CEO of Robinhood, the online brokerage app, talking about how he wants his app to disrupt the world of stock trading like Amazon disrupted the world of home shopping. And I think that speaks to exactly the mission that a platform like Robinhood has, which is to democratize investing. Robinhood was started in 2013 by Vlad Tenev and by Jubat in where else Silicon Valley, as an alternative to the big brokerages, but with one big difference. As they were building the social network around finances for people, they realized that there was a gap in the market and that free trading could become something that they could bring to the markets, they could disrupt the industry. While no fee trading is industry standard today, it was unheard of when it was first introduced. The online brokerage industry was really innovative when they came on the scene 10, 15 years ago, but they kind of stopped innovating where you haven't seen those commissions come down beyond five or six or seven dollars. Robinhood, think that by offering zero commission, that they're gonna push people onto this platform. And on top of no fee trading, the customer's Robinhood was courting had been long overlooked in the world of finance. So the typical customer of a Charles Schwab, for example, is putting a lot more money in that brokerage account than the typical customer at Robinhood. Even today, with all of its popularity, the median account size is about $240. There's fidelities in the Schwabs and the e-trades of the world. They look down their nose and those kind of accounts. I don't want a $1,000 account to just the headache. I want a $100,000 account. And this is key here, right? Because the thing about Robinhood, that's different than every other single brokerage platform is how easy it is to use. The design of the Robinhood app really has in mind a user who might be coming at this absolutely cold. The fonts are very well-sized, the shapes, the colors. All of that is something that the founders of Robinhood paid really close attention to. And by creating an interface that catered to a newer investor, they were able to gather a pretty healthy group of customers. And by 2019, they had about 10 million customers. Those 10 million customers were a huge success story for Robinhood, but no one could have predicted its explosion after the arrival of COVID-19. Remain indoors to the greatest extent, and 100% of the non-essential workforce must stay home. What we saw when the pandemic...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1886,2022-11-22 15:45:53
19273," And 100% of the non-essential workforce must stay home. What we saw when the pandemic hit was the growth of Robin Hood users absolutely turbocharged. And oddly, you saw this surge in interest in stock trading. Then they saw the absolute surge in 2020 in customer growth. And now by many accounts they have more than 20 million customers, which is pretty extraordinary. So the next step for them is to figure out how to monetize those users and how even with their small account sizes to get them to grow with the company. And as it releases more products, come along with them. Robin Hood would become one of the COVID economies' breakout successes. Robin Hood traders, as they're called, became the shorthand explanation for the frenzy of often speculative retail investing after the pandemic lockdowns. Kids wake up in the morning, they go on Robin Hood. They're, you know, in the shower, they check Robin Hood. Kids are learning how the stock market works at 18 while they're at school, you know, checking their phones in between classes, because notifications pop up telling them what their stocks are doing that day. With these new tools, millennials and Gen Z are investing in the market and ways their parents could have never even dreamt of. That is sort of key when we talk about the divide between older and younger generations is that the younger generation is exposed to so much more information and tools at their disposal to do what they want in the market. The older generations, you never had the technology or the cost structure that you could play the markets like you can today. So you were stuck with giving your money to a professional investor and paying them a fee to do it. When I speak to young kids, they tell me, I'm making mistakes, I'm losing money, I'm not a perfect investor, but I'm 18 and by the time I'm 30, which will be, you know, 10 years from now, I'm going to have interacted with the markets for a decade. And so it's a learning experience more so than anything else. And you can look at it and you can say, wow, that's, you know, that's risk taking that's dumb. You know, if you could possibly shave 10, 20 years off your working life versus adding five years, I don't think you can fault people for that. But Robinhood is only part of the puzzle. Sure, you can trade on it, but without research information and data, you're just blindly throwing darts at different stocks and hoping to strike it rich. Wall Street forever has always run on what we now called narratives or needs, you know, people telling rumors to each other, they've been around for 100 years. On Wall Street information is its own currency. Historically, either you had it or you didn't, and the people who had it had a huge advantage. And in the past, those narratives and means didn't have a network effect. It would be one person telling another person over the phone. In fact, when I broke into this business in the 80s, a lot of people used to complain that they weren't on the call list to get those ideas. Social media changed all of that fast forward to 2021. That's being done on the internet now. And that's being done on discord and Twitter and stock tweets and Reddit. And the impact is very similar, but orders and orders is meant to be too large. As social media has played a bigger partner lives, it's also played a bigger and kind of more important role in how people find investing ideas online and on these platforms. How do those ideas spread on TikTok? Yes, that TikTok. Soon, may the weatherman come to bring us...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1887,2022-11-22 15:50:03

The personal finance hashtag on TikTok has garnered 3.5 billion views from its 1 billion monthly active users. By comparison, videos found under the cooking and health tips hashtag have 2.6 and 2.1 billion views respectively. The trajectory of Robinhood and TikTok were literally on par. What happened in the secmer at this week? So the word of the week is expectations. Absolutely essential that you just understand the risks of shorting. And Kayla Kilbrot and Kyla Scanlon are two of those financial influencer TikTokers, also known as Finn Fluensers. I think people still care about fashion. They care about culture, but it's also like there's this big behemoth thing called the stock market that we really don't know a whole lot about and it's gatecapped behind the industry. And so people like want to unpack that. And so my audience is a lot of them are younger investors who are looking to hone their skills. Tech in right up. Kyla and Kayla are two of the more, let's say, professional TikTok influencers. The Tesla ARC Bitcoin biotech risk cluster. I've been trading since high school and it was a really interesting way for me to fill out my decision making frameworks and to think about thinking. And I think that the more that we can have people thinking about finance, the better that we're going to progress as a society, I think it's a huge gap in our educational system. If you're going to buy an option for a stock, you can just go up. It's a call. So think of it like this. I made the options video where I was like options are just like shopping. Rumor has it that this pal is about to go up in price. So if I come in tomorrow, can I still buy it at its price and a ton of women just like attack that video and we're like, you explain things so much better than my boyfriend or my professor or like I could sit and listen to you all day and I was like, the this is what I was looking for. But TikTok's algorithm does not reward common measured videos about responsible investing. It rewards this. Watch this video for 30 seconds and you'll be rich for the rest of your life. I try not to say the a word, the a l g o word because TikTok listens to us. The algorithm does impact how you feel. You know, you do notice which videos do better versus which videos do worse. How do you catch some of the tension in less than 60 seconds? And how do you make it something that they're like, I need this in my life. Nearly impossible to do that in 60 seconds. But the people who perfect it are the people that you're going to watch and give a stick around. And where people are sticking around, Reddit and it's nearly countless subreddits about finance. And by far the biggest one of those is Wall Street Bets. There's a lot of social media platforms out there. But Reddit is like the social media platform for finance. Places like Wall Street Bets is where it all goes down. Started in January 2012, it wasn't long before Wall Street Bets adopted a 4-chan-like etiquette. Leading to their tagline, like 4-chan, found a Bloomberg terminal. We had all these unexplained stock and we would be grasping for a wide stock XYZ junk 20% in a day. And you would look at Wall Street Bets and you would see people there talking about buying options in that stock. And it sort of squared the circle, so to speak. And it started making sense. And it was at that point that it was like, wow, we have to start paying attention to this. Some people on the platform really spend tons of time. And others were just looking for entertainment and to have a little bit of fun effectively gambling or looking for an outlet trying to make a little bit of money. Then on top of all of that, there were stimulus checks. Now clearly, this money is going to people who need to use that to eat, to live. But there's a lot of people who use this money to invest in the stock market. And it's not just stock tips. People quote unquote, yo-lo, their entire life savings or stimulus checks on a single stock. They post what is called gain and loss porn. Screen grabbing staggering hits and misses on stocks for the entire community to see. I am about to lose everything. And while some of the people on Wall Street Bets are novice investors, the-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1888,2022-11-22 15:54:37
19275," And while some of the people on Wall Street Fets are novice investors, the community contains multitudes. In one respect, what it did show us among these network groups is they are very sophisticated. They're not a bunch of ignorant people talking to other ignorant people. And this is where the pieces of the puzzle all come together to wreak havoc on Wall Street for a solid week in early 2021. It's pretty clear that the combination of more people having retail brokerage accounts and trading apps, and more people being stuck at home looking for some kind of entertainment and some kind of community online, came together in this very singular way. What came together is GameStop. Let's go back to the beginnings of what happened with GameStop a couple of years ago. On the boards like Reddit and Stocktwist, a lot of people were talking about GameStop as being attractive value. Some of them are even, you know, Wall Street alums who left the industry and now still have access to tools that they can use to improve their financial well-being and make very good decisions. And I think Warring Kitty is a perfect example of that. GameStop is one of the most compelling asymmetric opportunities in the market today. Really, I don't understand how you can disagree with that. At the same time that this crowd was talking it up, the hedge fund institutional crowd didn't like the stock at all, and it had the largest short interest of any stock in the New York Stock Exchange going into late 2020. Short selling is a bet that a stock price will fall and it's a fairly simple concept. An investor borrows a stock and then sells it. The investor is betting on buying the stock back later for a lower price before returning it to the original owner pocketing the price difference. What a short seller would tell you is that they almost act as a policeman in financial markets or they're at least looking for companies that aren't what they say they are. And that can range anywhere from an outright fraud that some short sellers try to expose to just a company that's not worth as much as investors think it is. The problem is if the stock price rises, the short seller has to come up with the money to buy the stock back. And the more rises, the more it costs. And that's what's called a short squeeze and the hedge fund Melvin Capital was on the wrong end of that squeeze. Melvin Capital lost over 50% of its money in the month of January alone just from being caught in the short squeeze of the stock. This is where the disruption comes in. One of the most wild stories you're ever going to see, GameStop shares absolutely going nuts. In less than a year, the company's stock has jumped from less than $3 a share to almost $350. Cheers everybody! Roaring Kitty has turned $50,000 or so investment into some $14 million. Investors all over social media use the free trading app Robinhood to wreak havoc on Wall Street. They're actually piling on into some of these stocks to really hurt the professional short sellers. And they all used Reddit, Twitter, TikTok and Discord to tell one another to keep buying and quote, hold the line and not sell GameStop. People are getting cheerleaded for jumping in, buying at the highs, they're saying keep going. And it was working too. Until. Thursday morning, the trading app Robinhood sent out this tweet. In light of current market volatility, we are restricting transactions, including GameStop. People were really angry. Robinhood was supposed to allow the regular people to play the same game these big boys are playing. But instead, we were all taken for schmucks and they screwed us. Shares of GameStop are jumping again now that retail investors are being allowed to buy shares of the stock. But what we learned is that when people organize online, they have the ability to disrupt the market. And it was a big sign that ivory rolls up institution artist powerful. It's maybe the institution's left them to be. I don't know if pumping out GameStop was the best use of billions of dollars. But I think that as a signal to society, it was pretty interesting and powerful. The GameStop saga was so impactful that both.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1889,2022-11-22 15:58:55
19276," Interesting and powerful. The GameStop saga was so impactful that both Vlad Pennev and Roryn Kitty were called into testify before Congress to clarify each of their roles in the saga. One thing that's emerged from the congressional hearings is that they're interested in how retail brokerages make money and whether they're keeping the vast interest of their customers in mind. But it's pretty fuzzy as far as what they would actually do as a result. While the frenzy around GameStop eventually subsided, it didn't take long for retail investors to find other areas to invest their money. Take a look at Bitcoin going bananas over the weekend. Bitcoin forms a brand new all-time high. It was after GameStop started to drop that we saw Bitcoin really go up to over 60,000. How much further does Israeli have to run? It's compelling to say that money shifted from one venue to the other. While correlation doesn't equal causation, there's a chart out there showing an inverse correlation on mean stocks going down and cryptocurrencies going up. There's definitely an aspect where people are making money on stocks and then moving, you know, they're agnostic, they're not hedge funds. They can invest wherever the hell they want. It's a classic sort of momentum trade they're going to wherever the winners are and they're willing to jump on and, you know, ride it. So whether it's mean stocks like GameStop, mean coins like Dogecoin are entirely new ways to invest in art like NFTs, the new kind of retail investor is making its presence known. Over the next 10, maybe 15 years, you're going to continue to see whether by choice or by force that baton go from older generations to younger generations. I don't think any single app is going to be the thing that disrupts. I think people are the disruptors. How people get ideas about what to invest in has become increasingly entwined with social media. And as social media companies govern more and more of our lives, the fact that now they're tied in more intimately to people's wallets is something that we might want to understand better. Usually what disruption I think means is technology comes in whether it's blogs, the newspapers or online, retailing to brick and mortar. They come in and they're in the same business, but they just do it in such a gigantic cost savings that it causes everybody to switch. Well, that's the risk that happens here is that it's so much cheaper to just manage your own money. We're not there yet, but costs and conveniences are moving in that direction. So I'd say Wall Street, you haven't been disrupted yet, but you could be in the coming years and that the final chapter on this story hasn't been ripped. Meet Bloomberg's own David Nicholson. Now his happy place is out in the field, on the open road. But like the rest of the world lately, he's been working from home a lot more than he's used to. COVID-19 has prompted a massive urban exodus as professionals of every ilk yearn for more space to live and work. As a result, rural areas have exploded and they're poised to experience a resurgence as more and more families pack up and leave the big city to try out life in the burbs. But there's one problem with that. Not all internet speeds are created equal. Anyone who might need to upload or download large files for a living?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1890,2022-11-22 16:03:11
19277," But there's one problem with that. Not all internet speeds are created equal. Anyone who might need to upload or download large files for a living may not want to pack up and move to that cabin in the woods just yet. Now, David's house isn't a cabin, but it is in the woods, and inexplicably, his internet is workable. My internet is okay. I pay a lot for it. It's around $140 a month. The download speed is great, and the upload speed is terrible, which is really bad for my work, because I have to upload these massive files. But I'm definitely one of the more lucky ones in this community. Just a few miles down the road, my buddy has awful internet. It's usually under two down, and under point two up. So it's often unusable. Some days it's around one, and other times it'll drop down to about point two, point three. I just want to be able to have internet at my house without having to go outside the normal ways of acquiring internet. It's really frustrating. We're literally miles, a few miles away from downtown, and it just cuts off. This is a problem, and the solutions are not there yet. Because getting high speed internet and rural areas on mass is something our providers may simply not be ready for. If your internet service doesn't have fast download and upload speeds, then you don't have high speed harmony. You have. Americans on average pay about $70 a month for internet at home. But in rural areas, it could cost a lot more for a lot less service. So the pricing for a fixed wireless provider here can be something between $80 and $150 for about $25 megabits per second. However, Gigabit's service, which is a thousand megabits per second, and Symetrical is running it about $119 a month through $130 a month. That's John Paul. He co-owns Spiral Fiber, an internet service provider here in Nevada County, California. For the past 10 years, he's been trying to bring an affordable fiber optic network to town. It all started when he applied to be part of the pilot program for Google's fiber service. Across the country, civic boosters have been going to extreme, chanting, singing, and marching, trying to get the search engine giant to look at their town. The internet these days is crucial to be in the world, to be a part of the world, and to be connected to your community. Google ultimately went with Kansas City, Missouri, which left Paul on a mission to get funding to layout fiber optic networks for Gigabit service. Over the next several years, he would attend conferences and pitch venture capitalists and apply for grants to make his vision come to life. One of the biggest roadblocks to building infrastructure for the internet here in the United States are the existing large providers. They have their landstaked out. They would prefer that nobody come in and compete against them. In 2013, we applied for a grant. We went down and met with the commissioners at the California Public Utilities Commission. It was an arduous process to get funded, but we finally did against all odds. We got a $16 million grant and then we went out to seek venture capital. Then in March of 2020, the pandemic hit the world. They got locked down and everybody came home and everybody started using the internet. And I remember seeing on one of the local fixed wireless providers websites, they've said, hey, we know you're all staying home, but please don't use too much video and please don't use too much bandwidth. And I thought that doesn't work. The US connectivity gap is far greater compared to countries that are considered its peers economically. Some developing nations actually have better internet than rural America. American Kenya, which has a state-of-the-art fiber optic network fed in from their coastline. The American connectivity gap does largely affect rural areas that are either outside of service coverage or simply prohibitively expensive. This is Rebecca. She earned her family moved to Nevada County just a couple miles down the road from David. They took for granted that high-speed internet would just exist in the area and it's not something they even bothered to check.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1891,2022-11-22 16:07:44
19278," Her family moved to Nevada County just a couple miles down the road from David. They took for granted that high-speed internet would just exist in the area and it's not something they even bothered to check on before buying their house. Turns out all they got was dial-up. We wanted to move where we had a little more space, room for the kids to run around, you know, just be out in the mountains a little bit more. Having come from a bigger city area where Wi-Fi is pretty readily available, we hadn't really considered that in our purchasing of the house, whether that would be an option or not. When school started and now that we are remote learning with our children and we're doing everything from home, we didn't have the option to do that at our house. So every day when school would start, we'd have to pack the kids up and we'd go to my in-law's home. They have a little cabin up in this area that does have Wi-Fi already. Rebecca's situation is the norm in rural America. Getting the data from the Federal Communications Commission, just 4% of urban Americans lack access to broadband internet. That's compared to almost 40% of people who live in rural areas. While that was the case, there were also racial and socioeconomic divides in terms of who had that access. In addition to that geographic difference, low-income African-American students, Latino students, and first generation of college students were more likely than others to have only one device at home that shared among multiple siblings and or lack access to that actual connection. For most American towns, there's also a lack of competition, forcing internet prices up. And large providers like AT&T and Concast aren't incentivized to expand service to these rural communities. This is how Xfinity makes life simple, easy, awesome. So in our area, we have a small imprint of Concast, but they're not going to go out to the more rural areas. It's just not cost-effective for them to do it as a large company. In order to lay fiber cable, you're actually physically digging trenches into the ground. And for internet service providers, they're primarily focused on maximizing their profits. And so the fewer customers you have in any square mile and the more fiber you have to lay, that's just kind of harder to pencil out from a purely economic standpoint. AT&T released a statement on the matter, expressing the need and desire for government assistance to fund fiber optic expansion to areas deemed unprofitable. Concast released a similar statement encouraging more public-private collaboration on this effort. Federal agencies do offer grants to help communities build broadband networks, but many have argued that there's not enough flexibility on how to use these funds. The COVID-19 relief package passed by Congress in March and signed by President Donald Trump awarded $43.3 million to 51 projects on the East Coast alone. But it also stipulated that these projects needed to be up and running by December 30. For contractors who plan projects months and years in advance, it's a scramble to rearrange their schedules to meet that deadline. So what we've been asking the federal government to consider is at least as long as the projects are getting started, knowing the projects are being put into place to expand both remote learning, working from home and opportunities like that that are truly driven from COVID. When moving as fast as we can regardless, but hopefully they'll give us some more time. Talking to John Paul, it's clear that he believes broadband is something that can transform a community and should be considered a public good. One of the first communities to come on in the United States with full on gigabit service was Chattanooga, Tennessee. Now, they're a bigger city, but they're a city that was economically in a downturn. In the last 15 years, the city of Chattanooga has turned around in an amazing way. It's a nexus for young people to move to. It's a place where technology happens. It's not just about logging on to Zoom, you know, to connect with your colleagues who might be in New York City. It's also your ability as a small business, you know, operating in the town of Nevada City or wherever it may be to, you know, quickly upload your payroll documents or something onto the cloud or to quickly, you know, swipe a customer's credit card.

So one two five eight seven ten ten ten ten ten ten ten ten ten ten ten ten ten Historically the marginalized people you call them as untouchables or dhaliths they have been kept away from the center of the knowledge once you are born into a caste it is very difficult for you to grow beyond that you are stuck in that identity. Education is the best way of liberating them so that's how I chose to work in education sector. The kind of education that we are giving to the marginalized people is going to change not just the fate of these communities in Telangana but it is going to be the source of inspiration source of hope for all the marginalized in this country. The greatest flight in India is the system of caste. For generations of Indians the social code known as the caste system has defined how people earn a living and whom they marry. Although outlawed seven decades ago caste remain a significant factor in deciding everything from family ties and cultural traditions to educational and economic opportunities. Dalits people who are on the lowest rung of the caste system constitute almost one-fifth of India's population of 1.3 billion. Not able to afford the high tuition of private schools many are forced to attend government-funded institutions which in the past have suffered from poor infrastructure, lower education standards and high student to teacher ratios. But Dr. Praveen Kumar is trying to change that. I am currently working as head of the Telangana social welfare residential schools. So totally about 400 schools I managed. These are all residential schools for the students who are historically marginalized but talented and poor. Of them 60% are girls and then 40% are boys because girls are more marginalized among the marginalized. They voices are always suppressed. My approach to improve the conditions in the schools has been put your eyes and ears on the ground always. Stock to the parents, stock to the teachers, stock to the students, stay in the schools and then understand their problems, they challenge us both in classrooms and then the corridors and the dorms, then go to the dining halls and see what kind of food they are eating and then go to their homes and then what kind of food they are getting. What kind of challenges the parents have in the classroom? One of the important changes that I brought in after I took over was to complete the transformation of mother tongue to English medium because English medium as I said English is the language of...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1893,2022-11-22 16:16:06
19280," For mother tongue to English medium, because English medium as I said English is the language of emancipation and language that connects you to the whole body of knowledge in the world. So we had to train a lot of teachers. It's like a dictionary also. Okay, I'm final to the new meaning. As I was going to describe it, I'm teaching how I am. I see them by the time you have a good view. I find the lesson a lot. Identity is extremely important. There is a scientific evidence to prove that, you know, your sense of identity is extremely crucial to your growth as a successful human being in your life. If you accept an identity which is very humiliating, which reminds you of a very painful past, I think, or that identity will not help you to grow. Not that I'm not saying that you should forget your past, I'm not saying that, but that should not be the bubble in which you must live always. Sweros is an alternative identity. S stands for state, W stands for welfare, Aero. S, W and then Aero is Swero. So, the idea is your dreams have to be skybound. So, that is what we are trying to achieve by changing the identities. Like, you know, I'm a Swero. And I aim to be a doctor. I am a Swero. I aim to be a top-notch engineer. I am a Swero. I aim to be a top bureaucrat of this country. I'm a Swero. I want to be a very good actor or, you know, a musician in this world. So, these are the positive images that are associated with identity. Just to give an example to you. See, in 2012, in our institution, we used to produce about six doctors per year. But because of our, you know, this self-eliberating ideology of Sweroism, we have this year, we have produced about 189 doctors. This is phenomenal for any purists of the poor people. You know, how difficult it is to get into a medical college in this country. So, but today, because of this ideology, the students have been able to achieve this, you know, feet. Pujita has been a form-lebror. Her parents, the angels, are agricultural labourers. And then this girl used to sell vegetables, but thanks to the residential education institutions, she came to the Gowl-Edo D campus and then she toiled very hard for one year, despite many problems. And today, I'm so happy to share with you that, you know, she has joined one of the prestigious medical colleges in the state of Telangana, Usmani Medical College. And then in future, she hopes to be a gynecologist. So, this is the journey our children are hoping for. Similarly, the Mount Everest Expression. Mount Everest Expression, we are very fortunate enough to place the youngest ever female in the history of this world on the peak of Mount Everest. How did this happen? It's all because of an ideology that helps you to liberate yourself. The world is a paradise, a paradise. We've got a lot of extra-curricular activities and most of them got institutionalized now. So, for example, music. Similarly, the games, we have so many coaches, coaching academy, boxing academy, a Brazilian academy. We have a handball academy. So, we have a, you know, a cabadilla that traditional Indians spoke. We have gold. We have introduced a gold falcon. Goldfees generally played by so-called rich people. But today, even poorest of the poor people also are being trained in gold in our schools. So, our intention has been to give all 360 degrees, you know, type of opportunities to the students.

19281," You know, a type of opportunities to the students, so that we are interested in whatever activity they can go and then do it. Break the barriers, break the fence at least mentally, because poor people have been programmed to be victims, programmed to be subjugated, programmed to be on the margins, always programmed to feel inferior. We wanted to change all that. There are certain games which are exclusive to rich people. There are certain languages which are exclusive to middle class and upper middle class in this country, to put it in one world. The sole aim of introducing all these co-curricular activities is to break the stereotypes which are reclusively imposed on these people. Their stereotypes talk to Kumar knows all too well. Born a Dalit, his grandparents were labourers and access to the village well was restricted. Dr Kumar credits his parents' belief in the power of education with helping him realise his aspirations. He went on to join the Indian Police Service, attended Harvard University and then began pursuing educational reforms back home. I attribute whatever I am today to my mother primarily. They educated me in the village, although there were no good schools. So then I stayed in social welfare hostel, the hostels which are managed by government for the poorest of the poor kids. I passed with reasonably good grades. Then I went to university and then I faced a worst form of discrimination in the universities like. In those days I am talking about the bathrooms and toilets were exclusively meant for social care and so on. I used to fight discrimination on one hand and then again try to excel in academics day in and day out. That's how I came to education because I deeply believe that education is the only important weapon that can really place the poorest of the poor people from a very victimhood orbit to prosperous orbit. I think in future this is going to be a game changer for the marginalized in this country. I think that's going to be a game changer for the poor people. I think that's going to be a game changer for the poor people. I think that's going to be a game changer for the poor people. If you look at a thermal image of a city and then compare that to a map of vegetation, you'll find that where there's greenery the temperature is lower. That's because things like asphalt, concrete and shingled roofs absorb more heat from the sun than trees. This is the urban heat island effect and it accounts for higher temperatures in cities often by several degrees compared with their surroundings. It's becoming a huge risk to human health as growing urban populations exacerbate the heating effects of climate change. Heat waves kill more people than any other extreme weather event, more than tornadoes, hurricanes and even floods. That's why urban heat island mitigation strategies are being studied in Singapore by a group of researchers. The government back project called Cooling Singapore is now in the process of combining everything they've learnt to create a digital tool that can help cities all over the world. Starting.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1895,2022-11-22 16:24:56
19282," It called Cooling Singapore is now in the process of combining everything they've learned to create a digital tool that can help cities all over the world. Starting with Singapore. In Singapore, close to the equator, temperatures regularly rise above 32 degrees Celsius or 90 degrees Fahrenheit. And the city structures only make it worse. And that is also the case for Singapore, which is basically a concrete jungle, more urbanised, more developed city. And even in Singapore, what you have is a situation whereby there's a temperature difference of 7 degrees Celsius between the more urbanised and the more rural areas. The government has taken drastic steps to keep temperatures down. This is Gardens by the Bay, an award-winning park. And inside this greenhouse is a pleasant 24 degrees. That's because the dome, along with two dozen nearby towers full of thousands of people, is chilled by what's probably the world's largest underground district cooling system. It uses a large central plant that cools water and then pipes it into banks, residential towers, an exhibition centre, shopping malls, and the city's iconic Marina Bay Sands hotel and casino complex. So one of the biggest perks of using this system for the buildings is that they can save 40% in terms of electricity usage, compared to your traditional air conditioners. And with Singapore relying on natural gas for most of its power, this new system means emission savings equivalent to removing 10,000 cars from the city's roads. That has big implications for the rest of the world. If things stay as they are, more than a third of the world's electricity could end up being used to cool buildings and vehicles by 2050. As the world gets hotter, gets warmer. There is a greater need for air conditioning and as well as refrigerators, for instance. And the more people are buying these household appliances, the more energy usage they use and they release heat more. And that then exacerbates climate change. It's a vicious circle. And so since 2017, researchers at Cooling Singapore have been identifying design solutions that reduce our need for so much cool air in the first place. One thing many cities have in common and that's the importance of vegetation. That's a very important measure to mitigate the urban heat. Because of the shading effect, of course, and the psychological effects of the vegetation. And also because of the possible evaporative cooling effect of the vegetation. Vegetation can be, of course, on the ground floor in form of trees and shrubs. And you can walk under them. This is the so-called canopy layer that the vegetation forms above us. But vegetation can also go up the facades of buildings. And it can go to the roof of the buildings. Luckily, Singapore has been striving for the garden city feel for quite some time. It was a vision initially introduced by them Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew in 1967, to make life more pleasant for people. And today, Singapore is one of the world's greenest cities in terms of urban vegetation. Camping Admiralty, a community centre that contains health facilities and social spaces, now provides more green space than the plot of land it was originally built on. It's topped by a roof scape of staggered terraces covered in local plants, which functions as a community park. And a village green in the centre that contains farm plots for residents to tend to. Park Royal on Pickering was designed as a hotel in a garden that doubled the green growing potential of its site. There's now 15,000 metres of sky gardens, reflecting pools, waterfalls, plantar terraces and green walls. And the government has big plans as well. Singapore actually has a plan to plan one million trees and add more green spaces over the next ten years. It is actually...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1896,2022-11-22 16:29:16
19283," Singapore actually has a plan to plan 1 million trees and add more green spaces over the next 10 years. It is actually a mix of one thing to reduce the urban hit island effect, but on the other hand is also to get the people to be more connected to nature. But it's not enough. The city state has still been warming twice as quickly as the wild average over the past 6 decades. That's why calling Singapore has developed a catalogue of other potential heat mitigation measures. When you try to mitigate your hit island effect in a city or in any building, in a village as well, the first place to start is by shading of the windows. You have to keep areas clear so that the wind can move through it. Water of a certain depth can act as a very good thermal buffer. If you have to construct heavy buildings such as high rises, at least you can make the surface the facade less heavy and you can protect it from direct sun penetration. You have to make sure that no combustion engines will be in the city in the middle and the medium to long term range. So ideally the electricity production is outside of the city and you bring just the clean electricity into the city. You can at least minimize the use of energy in the city and you can start to slowly convert the roofs, the facades of the city into production areas for renewable energy. In Singapore unfortunately this is a limited option but in the long run it could produce up to 20-25% of the energy of the electricity needed in Singapore if all the roofs and the areas in the buildings on the buildings on the facades will be used to do that. With so many different ideas, calling Singapore is also designing a virtual model of the city to test them out. It is called a digital urban climate twin or duct. It will calculate how each element of the city's design will impact the urban heat island effect. That means we model not only the geometry of the buildings digitally but also we model the transportation, the insulation, the temperature, the radiation coming from the sun, the weather, the local weather, the local climate, the even very, very micro climate of the city. The water, the movement of people in the city, we can invent scenarios, we can design scenarios, test them before we actually build them and if they test very well and we are sure that they will function then we can start to build them and put them into reality. Singapore will be using this new tool to figure out which actions it should take next. And the model can be applied to any city, whether it needs to keep heat out or keep heat in, which will ultimately save energy, slow climate change and improve our quality of life. So this is something that Singapore will be able to export, maybe even together with its city development system that it already has. Singapore is one of the very few cities in the world that really combine this scientific approach with a very well-established urban redesign approach towards agencies and the combination of its agencies. It has achieved a lot in the past. If it keeps following the scientific path and the combination with the other knowledge in the city already, we think that it will be a very comfortable and very livable city in the future even more than today.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1897,2022-11-22 16:33:35
19284,"<|iw|><|translate|> I have been writing this video for quite a long time, an actually 200,000 times. And so on and so forth. times are tough jobs are scarce it's risky to be outside and around others seems like there's very few ways to make extra money during a pandemic. So I guess I'll just hunker down and binge social media until this all blows over. Wait, don't these people make money? How do these people make money? Streamers, YouTubers, Twitch stars, how do they make money? Is it a lot? Is it a lot of work? I know, I gotta ask somebody in the biz and I got just the guy Austin John plays. This is your full time job now, right? Because of November of last year, yes, this was always just kind of like a side thing. Like any money that I made from doing my videos and whatever else, I never touched that because I didn't really think of that as being like real money and then it started coming in more and more and more and then it was like I hit my first day that I broke a grant and I was like, this is actually gonna be money. How did the YouTube channel come to be? And the game Pokemon Sun and Moon came out for the 3DS. There was like things that I learned about the game and then I wanted to just share that information with people and at the time I didn't have any way to capture screen or anything. So I found like generic footage and I kind of put it all together with so much editing and that video got six views and then two days later I made another one and that one got 12 views and then I just started pumping out more and more content and people were like, this guy knows what he's talking about. It really just started building on top of itself and then it was like my channel really focuses on tips and tricks. So I play a straight 18 hours and I'll finish the game or get to about the 40 hour mark and then I'll make my first video. While I'm going through I have a giant no pad and just scribbles everywhere and I make these notes of like the things it stumped me so I know the things that may stump other people. What do you need to think about if you're building your YouTube channel? One you need to do something that you're passionate about. Not that you like, not that you think you're going to make money on something you're passionate about. The other thing is something that other people are passionate about. It holds a special place to them. And third is it needs to be something that people are going to seek out information on. In order to enter into the marketplace you either need to be better than everyone else. You either need to be faster than everyone else or you need to be more accessible than everyone else. And you can't be more accessible because it's already on the platform granted if you understand how the algorithm works, which is very similar to Google Analytics, then yeah, you can have a little bit of a head start. But if you're not doing it faster and if you're not doing it better than everyone else, then why should in one watch your channel. So my income as a YouTuber kind of breaks down to three different ways. One, which is the bulk of it, which is ad revenue. Whenever you go and you watch a video and then there's an ad and then you wait five seconds and hit the bottom right corner and then you go on to the next video or a non-skippable ad or the video starts immediately. You get the little banner at the bottom or if you scroll down from the video, the first thing that shows there is an ad. Those are the four different types of ads that can appear on every single YouTube video. And all of them pay a certain amount. It varies on lots of things like the country of the person who posted the.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1898,2022-11-22 16:38:12
19285, YouTube video and all of them pay a certain amount. It varies on lots of things like the country of the person who posted the country of the person who watches it the time of year where you are in the quarter if there's anything going on with a reduction in ad revenue like great example COVID-19 companies weren't spending as much on advertising so because of that CPM went down CPM stands for click per thousand and using the Roman numeral for a thousand and that means that for every one thousand views you get a certain amount of money now on low ads when I first started off my CPM was 30 cents so every thousand views I made 30 cents but then once I signed with an MCN and I started making more quality content and more engaging content some of my better videos and certain times of the year I can see CPMs as high as 12 to 14 dollars and there's a big fluctuation between you know if I post a video when there's no ads being spent like January and February that's a reason a lot of your favorite YouTubers and also TV shows don't post new videos in that time of year because ad rates are down why are they going to make content then instead you're recording and you're bulking up for when ad revenue is higher the second way that a YouTuber makes income is support crowdfunding things like that when I first started off Patreon was really the only option but then they started rolling out supporters and members for YouTube channels so whenever I have a live stream you can click a button and then you could become a member and then you get a special icons next to your name I believe they're called badges or on any video you can hit the join button and that helps support the channel and then the third aspect of that would be merch and for me my merch has been somewhat basic in fact I'm wearing one of my t-shirts from last year right now you have to endure the times that your first video gets six views that you posted on Reddit and they say shut up and then an auto mod bans you you have to go through that because until you go through that and you discover why you're doing it you're not doing it for other people you're doing it for yourself if you're not loving what you do then it's not worth it huh so make a channel about something that I'm passionate about oh sweet I guess I can make the channel about that now how do I grow an audience how do I get popular it's all about diversification you have to have a massive Twitter following you have to have a massive Instagram following you have to have a massive YouTube following of course you have to be on twitch which is the key platform but basically anyway you can get in front of your audience you can engage with your audience and it is going to drive those clicks which ultimately drives the advertiser revenue that you get back from all of these platforms it's me and then playing video games and talking in a funny manner over them they're not just people who are good at games they're actually people who are good at online engagement online entertainment first and foremost you have the right to remain stylish anything you wear can and will be used to be seeing the quarter fashion the streamer is either very very talented at the game the best player in the game is generally going to draw crowd because people like watching people who are very good on the other hand they're either very very good or funny charismatic whatever it is on that side you know it becomes more of a show where they talk about other things outside of the gaming world and gaming becomes really just a backdrop and an excuse to engage with our audience there were those weird like Ronald McDonald like straight to VHS movies remember those I'm personable I'm chatty I would kind of you know when boring things were happening the game I would ramble on about you know movies I'd watched or books I'd read and you know or conversations I'd had,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1899,2022-11-22 16:42:19
19286," I'm personable, I'm chatty, I would kind of, you know, when boring things were happening in the game, I would ramble on about, you know, movies I'd watched or books I'd read on, you know, or conversations I'd had and stuff like that. And so I think being personable was a big part of that. It's not just getting on and playing games, it's getting on and being an entertainer. You are putting on a show. All right, now let me go ahead and grab the samurai sword that every gym has. Okay, he's dead. I have a larger audience and to have that audience, I think, stay with you. You have to bring something extra, you know, you have to find your niche, you have to find what works and what connects with the audience and what makes them laugh and what makes them keep coming back. You got to make it a little more exciting. All right, throw on a hanging bishop, have everybody in suspense for a moment. I think the real most important thing is to just get used to being on camera, like in any sort of performance thing is get used to talking on camera. You know, my first few videos were terrible. But because I sat down and did it for six to eight hours a day, I just got used to talking and I got over that uncomfortable hump. If you go into Twitch purely with the expectation that you're going to make money, make a job out of it, have all this growth and it's going to be great, you're probably going to burn out prior to getting to that point because there's very little payoff for a long time, right? Like multiple years generally before you really start to see a payoff. And so, you know, those first few times you're streaming, nobody is there. One person shows up every 30 minutes says hi, maybe, and leaves, right? Like, it's very discouraging, I think, for a lot of people. And so, you have to be there just loving it, you have to love talking to yourself when nobody is around, you have to love just the game that you're playing, all of that stuff because it takes a while and I think a majority of people burn out prior to getting to the like profitable point of it. And there you have it. My very own YouTube, Twitch, Discord and streaming channels all ready to go live. It's a veritable social media ecosystem just on the verge of thriving. So don't forget to smash like and subscribe and visit my Patreon for perks. Also, go to my merch page. And one last thing, stay cool, my friends. This is live stream shopping, one of the hottest trends in China. Every night, tens of millions of people watch live shows hosted by influencers like via and by the products they recommend. On e-commerce and social apps like Taobao and Do-In, the sister app of TikTok. I think it's already changed. It's a good way to buy a product that you can't buy. You can come and see. It's not about only shopping. It's about the experience. It's about having fun. You gotta see 3D, you gotta see in some kind of action. It's almost like a theatre act. The internet craze has taken over China. By the end of 2020, the country had almost 400 million live stream shopping users. China's live stream e-commerce market has also grown dramatically. It's an estimated value.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1900,2022-11-22 16:46:48
19287," E-cover's market has also grown dramatically, with an estimated value of $161 billion in 2020. It's becoming popular outside China as well. So it's live streaming the future of shopping. Live streaming is not a new thing, and China is started in 2015 with the rollout of 4G, and it was first used for entertainment and socializing. Many live streamers perform for their followers or chat it to them, making money by receiving virtual currency and gifts. In the last live streaming is mainly the domain of avid gamers, and China is broken into e-commerce. China actually has a very big e-commerce empire, so it uses these super apps, what we call that you have payment, you have search of information, you have recommendation system, and you have huge amount of goods available on the platform, and as well as a lot of consumers. So with this advantage, they merge these features of live streaming to make the influencers actually sell goods. Here is a perfect choice, nice neutrals, beautiful prints, nothing overwhelming, and the warmth and comfort of flannels. This is I don't know. Traditional TV shopping involves a one-way direction whereby a host introduces a product, demonstrates things and say call this number or something, but live stream shopping is live. That in itself is a very very big difference. They call this different psychology, and live stream shopping is a very entertaining way of actually engaging someone else. When you shop actually this live streaming video will continue, it will minimize into a corner, and you can buy the items and pay all on the same app. After that, the live streaming screen will just enlarge by itself, and the promoter will come back to screen. So it's very convenient. How about one of China's biggest e-commerce platforms owned by tech giant Alibaba added a live streaming function in early 2016? In the following years, other e-commerce and social platforms like JD and Do-In also integrated this feature. I've mentioned in detail in a few detail recently, Over 70 billion dollars were of good was sold by a live stream onということで, in the years from March 2021. Latest surveys show that over 60% of live stream users in China were watching shopping shows and over 65% of them shopped at least once via live stream. In 2020, live stream shopping got a huge boost during the pandemic. With millions of people were in lockdown and many retailers were pushed online. People during the lockdown felt like there's a need for more social interactions. This live platform creates an interesting kind of environment that these people the sense that are actually interacting with you. And then live stream shopping brings in a lot more variety of things that people could buy and satisfy in their sense of a music control especially during the pandemic. At the heart of this craze are the top influencers who have tens of millions of followers and sub-products worth millions of dollars every night. They often use their stop power to get bargains from retailers which in turn boosts their own sales and influence. So if you think about China's live streaming you have to know the king and queen of the influences. The queen of live streaming via she is actually having the biggest viewership and the biggest sales volume for a long time on top of her platform. She can sell everything from Gucci sunglasses, lipstick, homes and cars. One time she offered her followers to go on a Tesla ride with her and she even for once so they rocky launch in her live streaming room for 40 million yuan.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1901,2022-11-22 16:51:21
19288," right with her and she even for once so they rock you launch in her live streaming room for 40 million yuan. The king be Li Jiaqi, more widely known as lipstick brother. He used to be a cosmetic sales before he turned into live streaming e-commerce and he knows a lot about the cosmetics. So he's the one that we will actually put the lipsticks on himself when he's on the show. Top live streamers like Villa and Li Jiaqi have become celebrities in China and earn millions of dollars a year. Although not everyone can be as popular, mid-breaking live streamers like Tiffany still and a good income through sales commissions. So I got a lot of money but about it already due to staff description. My grandmother's story swing through the It's tiramisu plants. It never swept much of the lives in it. What made me want to tell you? I want to tell you something about the same thing. Unintentional was out of a string of love about your mother's love. If you don't have a horse, you can buy it. A lot of successful live streamers are generally very good at communication. They are very good at articulating very simply what the product does and what the product doesn't do. In order for them to sell, they need to be trustworthy and appear trustworthy. And they need to show in some ways that they are authentic. So, for Via and Li Jiaqi, they are able to articulate that quite a bit through their body language, through what they say, for example, Li Jiaqi will always say things about certain products because to him there is an honest opinion and sometimes people want to hear that. And so, they seem very credible, they seem very trustworthy. And don't forget, they are also very entertaining and very interesting. If you are familiar with Li Jiaqi, you want a Guinness record for the most lipstick applications, the models in 30 seconds. So, if you are able to create a lot of bars, you will have interesting things that you do. People who may not want to buy lipsticks, but also streaming just to watch what he does. And then from there, you might get hooked to just an e-binaural tool manager or a tool of comedy. Live streamers also use cell techniques such as limited time or supply. These sense of scarcity can often encourage viewers to buy. The platform in itself creates and enhances some of these things, but you see it live. Something we call social proof has taken over, meaning that, hey, other people are interested, other people are joining in, other people want the same product. And they add it in a chat and ask questions and say, oh, I want this too. What happens then? It makes the whole product even more scarce. But it's not just influencers, local farmers, luxury brands, even mutual funds, have also started their own live stream shows. Working with very top tier live streamers can be risky. It's not necessary that the benefits will end up with a brand. So we see company executives opening their own shows. And we see like PNG have their own sales room which runs shows every day as well. We also have local governments in small towns to sell their agricultural products. So the live stream is definitely transformed the way product owners can think about how to reach their consumers. And it enables a lot of players to actually sell. And live stream shopping is going global. Merchants in Southeast Asia have embraced this trend. And in the West, Amazon has upgraded its live streaming function, adding interactive features like chat rooms, companies including Google and Facebook are also developing and investing in technologies to integrate video and e-commerce.

19289," Companies are focused on testing projects out at sea, proving their durability, trying to raise capital and bring down cost. The sector hasn't really converged around one single technology design and companies are kind of undersided about which design works best. Finland-based AW Energy is a veteran in the sector. The first proof of concept of the company's device was made in the 90s after Diver, Rano Koei-Vasari observed the strong back-and-forth movement of a hatch cover in a shipwreck in the Baltic Sea. The waves are generated far from the coastline, so the wind blows on the surface of the water, causing the water particles to rotate. And that rotation extends deep down below the surface, and the waves can be very long, they can be several hundred meters long. And as they come into the near shore, this rotational energy turns into an elliptical energy and eventually back to the pause that you probably noticed if you've been swimming on the sea shore in large waves, you're pulled in and out. That's the energy that we're extracting. There's a sweet spot where we deploy, so around 10 to 15 meters of water depth, that's where there's still strong wave energy coming in. After years of research, prototyping and testing, the company has deployed Wave Roller, a 350 kilowatt device in the waters of Portugal. Wave Roller has an 80 meter wide and 10 meter high steel panel fixed to the seabed via a floatable foundation. The panel moves back and forth with the waves, capturing the energy. It's submerged in the depth of 15 meters, so it's protected from the extreme waves. We generate electricity by capturing the movement with hydraulic circuitry in a machine room underneath the surface. That hydraulic energy we turn to electricity with hydraulic accumulators and hydraulic motors and also our generator. The Wave Roller has survived large waves at sea for over a year and delivered electricity via an underwater cable to the grid in Portugal. Meanwhile, the company has won a 2.5 million euro grant to work on an upgraded version of the Wave Roller, aiming to increase the electricity generation capacity to 1 megawatt. The upscale device would have a bigger panel, two power takeoff units, and improved software to control the energy production. We have taken into use a very prediction algorithm that kind of tells us what kind of waves are coming in to our device. That gives us a few seconds to prepare for capturing more energy and the difference in that is significant. Our future plans are to deliver technology around the world. So I'm hoping we can be working on delivering technology to projects in Asia and also in American contents as well. Meanwhile, Israeli company ECO WavePower is taking a different approach to capturing the power of the ocean. The company's founder, in a braverment, developing new sources of renewable energy is a personal mission. I was born in Ukraine in 1996 and two weeks after I was born, the Chernobyl nuclear reactor exploded, causing the largest in history, nuclear disaster. I was one of the babies that got hurt from the negative effects of such explosion. I had a respiratory arrest and a clinical death. Luckily my mother and nurse approached my crib on time and gave me a mouth to mouth recitation with saved my life. I got a second chance in life and decided to do something good with it. Growing up, Anna wanted to be a politician to positively change the world. After working as a translator at a renewable energy company, she decided to change paths.

19291," Translator at a renewable energy company, she decided to change parts. Solar and wind energy were fully commercialized. There were a lot of amazing technologies implemented everywhere. I saw that wave energy, although it's an immense source of electricity, the biggest companies in the world are trying to develop wave energy with no success. And there was kind of a race going on in the world of who is the company that is going to develop a viable wave energy solution first. In 2011, the then 24-year-old inner co-founded EcoWave Power. Instead of installing devices offshore, the company's devices are attached to existing breakwaters, jetty's and peers. Our technology is very cost-efficient, especially in comparison to the offshore technologies, because we don't need any ships, divers, underwater mooring or cables when installing existent man-made structures and all our expensive equipment, the generator, the hydraulic conversion unit, the automation, is located online just like a regular power station. This is the EcoWave Power conversion unit that has been operating in Jaffa Port since 2014 until 2020. Here you can see how the technology works. Basically, the floaters are going up and down and pushing the hydro cylinders, which transmits by the gradeable fluid into land-located accumulators. A pressure is being built, the higher the waves, the higher the pressure, which is used to turn the hydro motor, which is turning the generators. The whole system is controlled by a smart automation system, which you can see right here. And in case of a coming storm, the system automatically raises the floater above the water level and keeps them in the upward position until the storm passes. The company has been operating a 100-kilowatt grid-connected device in Gibraltar since 2016, which is enough to power 100 households. Currently, Inrin and her team are working on another 100-kilowatt project at the Ported Jaffa in Tel Aviv. The project will be also the first time in the history of Israel that wave energy will officially connect to the electrical grid. And our goal going forward is to expand it to all suitable brakewaters in the city of Tel Aviv and to supply significant part of the city's electricity needs. Today, engineers and entrepreneurs are still trying to crack wave energy. Globally, only a few hundred kilowatts of wave energy are deployed, compared with gigawatts of offshore wind. But the filters come a long way in recent years, and with the right engineering solutions, this new power source could eventually become competitive with more mature renewables like solar and wind. I would have a lot more confidence in the success of wave energy companies today as opposed to like 20 years ago. But in the next few years or maybe the next couple of decades, it will be more likely to be used in remote locations like islands that are otherwise dependent on expensive diesel power or out at sea on gas-to-commissioning rigs or full powering underwater autonomous vehicles. So definitely, wave energy can compete with other renewable energy sources, but I personally believe that this is not a competition. In order to have a 100% renewable energy-friendly world, we need all renewable energy sources to work together.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1905,2022-11-22 17:08:31
19292,"............... I'm not going to... Please wait. You know, I've covered a lot of companies. I've covered a lot of Machiavellian companies where, you know, people play rough. I don't think I've ever seen anything on the scale that Nissan. I mean, you're eating corpus, you don't eat corpus. One of the most dramatic elements was Rivendor Passe's home being raided by court officials in Yokohama. You scared my children. I love these interesting things. So Rob Passe's journey into the darkest recesses of the Japanese corporate world started when he was the general counsel, the highest corporate lawyer position in the company. In the past few minutes, Nissan has revealed that its chairman has been arrested after allegations of serious misconduct. He was tasked with investigating Carlos Gough. And he was told conduct an internal investigation and get to the heart of the matter. And then along the way, he started to notice serious conflicts of interest. He is one of the few people who knows an extreme amount of detail regarding the alleged crimes by Carlos Gough. And he is now ready to tell his own story on the record about some of the events that happened. My name is Rivendor Passe. I'm the former global general counsel of Nissan Motorco Limited. And you could say yes, I had a front row seat in terms of what was going on. When Carlos Gough saved Nissan years ago, he was depicted in Japanese comic books as this hero. And now maybe we'll see comic books where he's the villain. In corporate Japan, Nissan was quite an unusual company. It was led for two decades by a non-Japanese executive. Well, Carlos Gough was a hero in the Japanese business world. If you had a global business celebrity in Japan and worldwide, it was definitely Carlos Gough. In a country with few foreigners at the top, he stood out. But over the years, he saved Nissan from bankruptcy, allied with Reno and Mitsubishi, and turned the alliance into one of the most competitive in the world. Yet as the years went on, I think his ambitions changed a little bit. He started thinking about legacy plays. And one of them was to really tighten the alliance between Reno and Japan. And unbeknownst to him, there was a contingent of senior Nissan executives that were really felt threatened by that move. They really thought that they would lose complete control of the car company. But even in the government, there was probably a little bit of anxiety.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1906,2022-11-22 17:13:08
19293," They really thought that they would lose complete control of the car company. anxiety about a national champion in the auto industry falling under full blown foreign control. He was affected by many in Japan. Now he's in jail. The arrest of Carlos Cohn came completely out of the blue. This was in November of 2018. He was coming to Japan on Nissan's corporate jet for a regular executive meeting. And he was met on the tarmac by Japanese authorities who whisked him away to jail and charged him with financial misconduct crimes. What happened was a power struggle ensued inside the company and somewhere along the way it was criminalized. By that I mean that there were allegations leveled at Carlos Cohn about the way he reported his pay to Japanese authorities, the way he handled money inside the company, that in other contexts might have been a board action, might have been handled internally. A number of executives at Nissan decided to take this difference and take it over to the Tokyo Prosecutors office. And that unleashed a chain of events that would shake the entire auto industry. So after Carlos Cohn was arrested, Nissan launched an internal investigation into the events that led up to his arrest. So Rob Pase was tasked with investigating Carlos Cohn and he was told get to the heart of the matter. Find out what Carlos Cohn did wrong and bring it to our shareholders. Yeah it's really complicated because you had various things coming out of the weeds. 2018 investigation has started and we become aware of matters in terms of conflicts, actions by certain individuals, that cause some concern because things might not quite be what they seem. So in our story we really took a close look at Harinata and his role in Carlos Cohn's downfall. Harinata is one of the most fascinating figures inside Nissan. He's also a lawyer, he's originally Malaysian. And he had a meteoric rise through the company and became very close to Carlos Cohn and other top figures. He had a front row seat at all the major strategic deliberations at the company. And when he discovered that Carlos Cohn as his final legacy play was going to tighten the relationship between Renault and Nissan, he made a decision to go against Carlos Cohn. And he became one of the key figures that decided that Carlos Cohn had to go. Harinata was somebody who actually recruited me into the company. So I have a long standing relationship with him or did have a long standing relationship with him. For many many years he was a mentor. I had doubts about the credibility of the process right at the start. Harinata had a plea deal with the Tokyo prosecutors. Now that suggests he was intrinsically involved in some of the wrongdoing or the allegations of wrongdoing. And it just didn't smell right, just doesn't sit right. So there was a basic conflict of interest. In other words, Harinata had to deliver results to Japanese prosecutors to avoid his own criminal liability and he's accusing and leading the investigation of Carlos Cohn. And then he found some of the people who had been involved in the original alleg...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1907,2022-11-22 17:17:13
19294," and he's accusing and leading the investigation of Carlos Gown. Some of the people who had been involved in the original alleged crimes were also looking into the affairs themselves. Revinder Pasi began pointing out some of these conflict of interest issues. And the reason for that is essentially his concern was for the company. If the company's own investigation into itself was compromised, that could lead to a very weak position in various lawsuits that it was dealing with across the world. I had discussions with Harry, discussions about with the statutory auditors about these conflicts, discussions with HR about some of these conflicts. Because at that point we reported into him. At the time everything was quite, as you can imagine, it was, we've got to do this, we've got to do that, we've got to move fast. But when you step back and look at some of these things, you just think, my God, what was going on here? Because me, members of my team, were being placed in immediate danger. Your chairman has been arrested. A representative director has been arrested. They both happen to be foreigners. And then now what we need to do, we're being instructed to do is certain compliance professionals need to go into properties in Brazil, for example, and retrieve evidence. They've got to do it very carefully, because if they don't do it carefully, they're going to get convicted of criminal activities. And likewise, when a team of lawyers were commissioned to go to Lebanon, one of my immediate concerns was, why are lawyers from Nissan being sent to go to Lebanon to retrieve evidence? These are just lawyers, they're corporate lawyers from Nissan. You had revelations that a number of executives had benefited from share appreciation rights, when they shouldn't have. I mean, you know, substantive amounts of money being taken by these guys when they weren't entitled to take them. And you do think, yes, how is this going to look later on? It's going to look quite concerning. So that triggered, for me, the sort of assessment that, well, I'm going to have to do something, because up until this point, I haven't put down on paper these conflicts and these issues. So Rob Posse makes a fateful move. It's just letter to the board, listing every suspicion he has in great detail backed up by evidence backed up by memos of why this internal investigation had serious problems. He sends a letter to the board, and it's crickets. He doesn't hear much of anything. Nothing happened there after. Nothing at all. Just like it just gone into a black box. And he began to suspect that there was a desire, even at the highest level within Nissan, to kind of sweep these conflicts of interest under the rug. Unfortunately for me, I think, you know, again, with hindsight, people must have thought that this is the nail that's sticking out, and we can't have this. Within three days of me submitting that to the board of directors, that letter to the independent board of directors, I was removed from the Goan Executive Conduct matters.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1908,2022-11-22 17:21:28
19295," submitting that to the Board of Directors, that letter to the independent Board of Directors, I was removed from the Goan Executive Conduct matters. I was then told that I could not attend board meetings anymore. And up until that point, I had attended every single board meeting. I was then also told that after eight years of being in Japan, I'd be going back to the UK. I eventually transpired that I'd be the VP of projects and transformation, managing a team of three. So you can imagine what this feels like at this stage. Almost an arbitrary removal from Japan, where I've lived for eight years, had three children there. My family has grown up and we've been settled there. Having a few months earlier been promoted to Vice President at a global level, to being almost demoted. So Pasi was essentially being reassigned to get him as far away from the internal investigation as possible and also to a certain extent in retaliation to some of the issues that he brought up regarding the internal investigation and Harinata. What happened to Rav Pasi can be seen as a series of corporate humiliations. I mean, first of all, his immediate responsibilities were taken away from him. Eventually he'd lost the coveted general counsel title. But it didn't stop there. Toward the end of his stay in Japan, Rav and his wife were convinced that they were being followed. During that period, I'd noticed that once driving my car, I'd have other cars following me. First I noticed this was a round mid-march and I was driving. I can't remember where I was going, but this grey van, small van, just literally started following me. And I noticed that there was somebody in the car taking pictures. And lo and behold, we were absolutely being followed. By either by people on foot or other individuals, two or three normally two burly men in a car, different cars at different times following us around. They were following the family as well. And given we'd seen the Nissan Security Department behaving a very, very egregious manner with others in terms of following and surveilling, I was very concerned as to what they were doing and who they were giving this information to. Because if they're giving this information to the authorities, you do think, why? What's going on here? I mean, this is just not normal behavior. And this all culminated in a rather dramatic event in the middle of 2020. Who are you people where Nissan had hired a legal team and had obtained an unusual court order from the District Court in Yokohama to basically do a search of his home and seizure of his corporate laptop and phone and other documents. If you don't let us in now, we have to break this key. So it's a pretty extreme way to treat someone who had spent 16 years at the company. These people have all come in. We don't really know who they are, apart from the fact that I've been shown a badge that says the Yokohama Court and they hit to recover a laptop and a mobile phone. It was even more weird because I'd highlighted to the directors that certain Nissan executives were trying to recover this laptop and this phone whilst I was still in Japan. And I was very concerned because it had evidence on there that related to misconduct matters and other forms of inappropriate conduct.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1909,2022-11-22 17:25:52
19296," and other forms of inappropriate conduct. It was just another form of intimidation, another form of harassment, forcing me almost to leave the company and the country. Because once they'd retained and obtained these items, we were still followed, which again, I just couldn't understand what is the point of doing that. You know, this is not a car company, this is not the KGB. I think it's fair to say that Rob Posse didn't have full battlefield awareness of all the intrigue going on at Nissan. I mean, Harry Nata is interesting because he's both charismatic and charming and one of the most brutal corporate infighters one could ever run across. It's a confidential company email, right? You should not have this. If he had fallen into line, he would probably still have his job at Nissan, be paid very well and continued his work. A career that he spent, you know, 16 years building at Nissan is irretrievably broken. It's been smashed to smithereens. He and his family paid a huge price certainly, but in terms of being able to sleep at night, I think, you know, he's come out ahead. I highlighted issues to the highest levels of the company so that they could be dealt with appropriately by those in charge. There was no response to those and there was retaliation against me. What's really profound, like absolutely profound, is that none of your colleagues, I mean people who you have known for years, forget it, you're on your own. And yeah, you gotta be ready for that. You gotta be ready for that. If you take it on anyway. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Hello good news fromifornias.org What's wrong with this question? Nothing happened before. Have you found yourself in, where do you intend on living? So, work in the future? This is the awful truth. There's always someone in the family that's pushing it.

19297," Does not deserve to be taken advantage of. Expressionally at your age with your own grandchild. Yeah. My grandma is having to sue them. I'm testifying against them. Nobody's talking. They're one floor below right now. I get afraid to go on the elevator. It's sad that it had to devolve to this. It's like a soap opera to me. It's a very sad thing. It's a family feud. A family feud. Here's a family that on paper you would think has the wealth that so many people seek yet. At the end of the day, it's seemed to sort of rip everybody apart. My name's Tom Schoenberg. I'm a senior reporter here at Bloomberg News. Cover financial enforcement. I was approached by someone close to the shot and steam family and asked whether or not I would be interested in writing about Beverly Shot and Steen in this case that she had against J.P. Morgan. And it was immediately clear that there was a great story here to be told. So I started just, you know, assembling all sorts of documents that the family made available to me. That included a diary that Beverly had begun writing when she started having suspicions about what was actually going on with her money. Beverly obtained her wealth from the shot and steam kind of retail empire that has at times included big lots, value city, American Eagle outfitters, DSW shoes. Beverly's husband died and at which point they sold off their portion of the company bringing them an enormous amount of wealth at around 1990. Estimates of her wealth were around $90 million. She for many years had that pool of money being managed by outside advisors. Her grandsons in the late 2000s had both graduated and were becoming financial advisors. She gave them a little bit to work with and over time, her grandson Evan became the trustee of her entire state. Managing sort of family money is not a conflict. In fact, some ways in wealth management, it's kind of how you get your start. It's kind of the seed that you need to sort of get going in the business. But Beverly started having suspicions that something was wrong probably in around 2016. Well, there were suspicious things, but taken separately without everyone talking about their own experiences, it was hard to really put it together. She had written a check to her caretaker Dawn that bounced. So she went down to her local Chase branch to sort of find out what was going on. She wasn't getting paper statements in the mail, so she asked them to print out a number of her statements having to do with her checking account and her credit card account. So we went to the bank and asked for the statements. And she got a whole year and going through all of them, page by page by page. And it was there she saw all sorts of charges that she said she did not the riser didn't know about. I was becoming very, very suspicious. I was starting to look in the money part, and that's what bothered me more when I saw that money was going. And I was not a big spender. Around the same time Dawn, she starts noticing Beverly's son, who lived in the condominium below her, came up with Evan with a shredder and started grabbing papers in her office area, including some with JP Morgan Letterhead, and just started sitting at the kitchen table just shredding documents over and over. Yeah, they came in one morning. They used to do it the back. Through the back door, and they brought this shredder inside, and then they went in the drawers in the office and took out all the papers, and they started to do it. I was very suspicious because I know you don't go around and get in destroying papers. Beverly said that they have done this many times before. That's when she said to me, you know, Dawn, I'm going to write my feelings in this black book. Diary. And she started writing each day. She would write a...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1911,2022-11-22 17:34:44
19298," To me, you know, Dawn, I'm gonna write my feelings in this black book. Diary. And she started writing each day. She would write a little at a time. We run the holidays of 2018. The package had arrived. A FedEx package. And in it were materials about a venture capital fund based out of the Cayman Islands. Dawn and some other family members take a look at this. They see that Beverly's signed up for this fund to the tune of $5 million over the course of several years. And that was really the beginning of it. That was sort of the tip of the iceberg when it became obvious that something was going on that my grandmother really wasn't aware of this fund. You know, Beverly started to panic. She was got really upset and called, you know, JP Morgan's headquarters in New York and asked for Jamie Diamond. She said she was told someone would call her back, but she says that that never happened. She wrote a letter to Evan and Avi. And in there, she laid out a number of things that were concerning her on authorized trading, the checking account she had about a million dollars worth of jewelry in a safe deposit box. And that her son, Bobby, had the key to that box. And that that jewelry had gone missing. All this was kind of packaged in this, you know, five page handwritten, a memento will and trust. They're such an evolving narrative about why the jewelry was taken. The only truth we really know is that the jewelry is gone. But why it happened, there have been a lot of different stories. You just don't take your mother's wonderful things and hand it out. And they email that note to JP Morgan to seize all activity on her account. And it ended up setting off a firestorm after that. As soon as they got this email that there was a season to assist and that she wanted to send her money and change brokerage firms, they were actually vacationing one floor below downstairs, they're there right now. The next day, Beverly's in her place. A granddaughter still in her place visiting, Dawn is there and up comes Bobby kind of barging through the door. And he's screaming about what was sent to the JP Morgan. They're now investigating now. And he's furious, takes his mother and sort of puts her into a chair, gets pen and paper, and she says physically forced her to write a retraction letter. They were pushing me around. It was a scary time. I was really afraid too. I had to take her to the doctor and she did an x-ray because she was in so much pain. The locks had to be changed, the phone number had to be changed. I really thought we were going to have to hire guards to be outside just for protection. Oh, it was terrible. It was horrible scene. Beverly brought her case before the financial industry regulatory authorities, usually known as Finra. It took several months' hearings. She sees all sorts of transactions that's going on. Hundreds of them that she claims that she never knew about, never authorized. But yet we're logged to JP Morgan's files as having been direct requests from her. That included the sale of a large amount of Apple stock worth several million dollars as well as all her stock and big lots. Over the course of their time with JP Morgan, Evan and Abbey were making all sorts of trading on her account that was generating millions of dollars in commissions for themselves in the bank. Yet she was not getting any of the type of gains that you would expect an 80 million dollar account in a bullish market to be able to get. They issued a ruling entirely in her favor finding that her grandsons as well as JP Morgan, they were liable for violating their fiduciary duty. This representing themselves and they also found that the bank and her grandson, Evan, reliable for elder abuse. Evan and Abbey were fired from JP Morgan. They issued an award of about 19 million dollars. I reached out for a comment in JP Morgan emphasized that Evan and Abbey were no longer with the firm and that their actions do not.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1912,2022-11-22 17:39:03
19299," of about $19 million. I reached out for a comment in JP Morgan emphasized that Evan and Avi were no longer with the firm and that their actions do not represent the sort of values of the bank. I reached out to Evan and Avi, heard back from their lawyer saying that they disagree with the law and the facts that Finra kind of used to decide the case against them and are seeing if they can have it withdrawn. Her son Bobby wrote her a letter. Said his sons weren't criminals and he also admits to taking her jewelry and he says he needed it to pay off some bad business debts he had. They never once came up to say I'm sorry. If there had been an apology and some acceptance and asking for forgiveness from my grandmother, I don't think we'd be in the position that we are now. Since the piece came out, we've received dozens of messages from people, many of whom are telling their own sort of personal tales of kind of financial advisors gone bad or family members who got control of in a state and abused those within. Seems that it's really resonated with a lot of people. I keep hearing a lot of feedback about Beverly and how a lot of people feel she did the right thing. You're never too old to stand up for yourself and try to write an injustice. She was adamant that she wanted to stand up for herself. At the end of the day, they did wrong. It's a painful life lesson. I've Beverly taught them that you don't mess with grandma. One of my grandparents, Dr.igt, he's an age to 10. Doctor Salesperson, who, said she was a great teacher during the labor during thelong time. When somebody hazardous to live with, naturally had a soup for liver transplant. He learned some strong knowledge that newspaper On April 20th oil markets did something they never had before and they crashed, went into negative territory and closed the day at minus $40. Meanwhile in a place called Thaden Boyce in Essex, a group of nine traders, led by a guy called Cuddles, made $660 million over the course of a couple of hours. The price of oil has collapsed to a record low. We've never really seen anything like it. WTI this morning down more than 35%. People maybe wouldn't have been so surprised if the oil price had fallen to zero, but the oil price went to minus 38. It went far lower than anyone had expected. And so lots of people in the market were saying, well hang on, something else is going on here. A couple of months later I started to get wind through a kind of network of sources that a tiny firm in the outskirts of London had made a huge amount of money that day. And potentially had some parts to play and what happened. The information we got was that nine traders at Vega Capital London had made in the region of $660 million in one day. As a group I think they made as much money in one day as Apple makes from its international sales in one day. I mean it's an insane sum of money. Did they pull off a fantastic trade? Did they predict the way the market was moving and get the absolutely right? Or was there something else going on and had they actually done something, the breached market rules in a bid to push the market and that investigation is ongoing. So Paul Commons is a trader who cut his teeth in the pits in the 80s and 90s when everyone had a nickname, his was Coddles.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1913,2022-11-22 17:43:28
19300," Cummins is a trader who cut his teeth in the pits in the 80s and 90s. When everyone had a nickname, his was Cuddles. If you can imagine that was a very sort of cut throat type of world where people are doing you know hundreds of thousands and millions of dollar trades by shouting at each other giving hand signals and then sort of scrolling on scraps of paper. The culture of the trading pits in London was very influenced by the working class guys in the came traders there. They weren't like the city bankers that had gone before them. They weren't usually Oxford or Cambridge. You know they didn't wear saddle rose suits. They were ordinary working guys who happened to have a talent for trading and a lot of them came from Essex. I think it was 400 traders in the pits and Cuddles in his you know oil and gas pit was described to us as amongst the top three in amongst that. It was very successful and made very large amounts of money as a young man. But you know inevitably mechanisation and the arrival of electronic markets was the kind of death knell for the pits and in 2005 the IPE closed down. And when the pits shut down a lot of the traders who worked their lost their jobs or quit or went to work for financial institutions, poor commons decided to start his own trading collective out in Essex. Some of them are ex-pick guys cut from the same cloth as him. Lots of them are actually sort of in their twenties and they're he's you know drinking buddies son or they're he's own kids friends from football. You know they're young lads hungry and ambitious and he brings them into the fold and fairly shortly he's got you know maybe a dozen or so traders that they're independent let's be clear but they're all part of this collective. Yeah I'll let Liam deal with Essex. I am from Essex so I feel like I'm free to you know to get into it. Sweet as they say. If you were to ask someone in Britain how they would imagine a kind of Essex person they would see someone who's maybe slightly flamboyant with a sort of cockney accent, a guy which you start accent. You know not afraid to splash the cash but it's probably pretty bright and it's done well for themselves. Don't even make sense does it. But you know these guys they drove around very nice rolls, roises and bent leaves they went to places like Marbaire on holiday. Fade and boys is a very wealthy place you have to have considerable income to be able to afford to live in that village it's a really nice place to live and it's 20 minutes to chew right away from the city. Earlier in the summer we have this lead which is that there's this tiny firm called Vega Capital London and they were the biggest winners from the biggest oil crash in history. You know anyone that covers markets is going to be surprised about that you know you're thinking your BP's of the world or your Glencores but is this tiny firm. And one of the big challenges that we had was actually finding out who worked with Vega Capital. It wasn't immediately obvious and at first we had absolutely no idea. If you go to the Vega Capital website it says it's under construction. If you do basic online searching it's very difficult to find anyone who's publicly connected to the company. So inevitably we're incredibly curious at this point like who the hell are these people. The more reporting we did the more it became clear that this group were connected socially as well as professionally. They went to weddings together they played golf together they would go and holiday together we found out that a number of them were members of the West Ham supporters club in London a few of them started companies together so you could see all the connections between them and start to see a distinct group emerging. And it really just was this kind of shock that you know this wasn't just like a hedge fund or a firm you'd never heard of this was actually a group of buddies who all had the same experience on this day and it had all made a huge amount of money. So if you're an oil trader there's a number of different ways you can trade and probably the most popular is WTI futures contracts. And it's basically a contract that says I'm going to buy a thousand barrels of oil from you at this point in the future or I'm going to sell a thousand barrels.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1914,2022-11-22 17:47:44
19301," Future's contract and it's basically a contract that says, I'm going to buy a thousand barrels of oil from you at this point in the future or I'm going to sell a thousand barrels of oil to you at this point in the future. It's actually just a financial contract to gamble on to predict where the oil is going to go up or down. On the 20th of April in Essex, there have been signals for a while that this was going to be an exceptional day in oil markets and we know that some of them arose early and started their trading in the early hours of the morning while it was still dark outside. Essentially what they were doing is buying contracts that gave them an obligation to buy oil at whatever the price ended up at 2.30pm. So they're basically placing a bet that oil was going to fall throughout the day. But they're simultaneously selling lots of oil as well and whether they make a profit and how much profit they make is the difference between what they buy the oil for and what they sell the oil for. Of course, we now know throughout April 20th the price dropped and dropped. So this is going very well for them. They are committed to selling oil at these prices and the prices are continuing to fall which means they're going to be able to offset it and buy oil at cheaper at the end of the day. Now once it gets to 1.30pm, that's when things start to get really interesting. Suddenly there's a kind of influx of buyers and sellers. You know, as desperation increases in the market and trading volumes go up. Now 2.08pm exactly something bizarre and unprecedented happened which is the oil passes into negative territory and it fell to a record level of minus 38 dollars. We've never seen anything like a period in terms of the contraction of the global economy. That huge gulf between what they were buying the oil for and what they were selling it for enabled them to make more money than they ever thought possible. So their profit was the difference between minus 37 and all of these positive numbers on every contract they sold. The price of crude briefly hit minus 37 dollars a barrel. For one group of traders operating from a small office it was a very very profitable day. It's important to remember this had never happened before in the history of oil trading. No one could have predicted it. I can't think of another example of where you enter a trade and you get paid on both sides. You get paid both to sell and to buy. You know, it's unthinkable. One thing we know about the cuddles trading arcade is that they were very comfortable taking large risks and you know you have to be clear this was a large risk. Yeah, we spoke to oil traders, both people that know these guys and people that don't and they all say that this is you know incredibly risky and that's actually what stops a lot of oil traders doing trading like this. They simply aren't willing to stomach the risk but cuddles in his friends were. So when the kind of final calculations came down the group of the nine most profitable traders made $660 million or theirabouts between them. I mean if you can imagine I think three or four of them made in excess of a hundred million each. One of the astonishing things about this trade is that two of the individuals who made more than a hundred million dollars in a single day were in their 20s. One of them was 22 years old. You know, in a few years earlier he'd been posting on his social media about doing teenage stuff with his mates in town and going to see girls and rap music and here he is a few years later making $100 million in a single day's trading. When me and Liam discovered that we were just we couldn't believe it. We couldn't believe what we were seeing. All trading is a zero-sum game. Anytime you're making money is an oil trader, someone else is losing it. Amongst the biggest losers were the investors in this Chinese fund, crude oil treasure fund. There were thousands of them and they lost everything. Lots of people have put their savings into oil funds. They lost money that day. Big banks and brokers who sort of stand in the middle of trading parties. They lost money that day. And another interesting thing is the oil producing countries like Q8 or Canada, they sell oil as an average of the WTI closing price over the preceding month. So the fact that one of those numbers in the average was minus 37, men if you can imagine countries like Saudi Arabian Q8 potentially lost a couple of...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1915,2022-11-22 17:52:06
19302," being month. So the fact that one of those numbers in the average was minus 37, meant if you can imagine countries like Saudi Arabia and Q8 potentially lost a couple of dollars on every single barrel of ore they sold that month. Vega Capital's traders made such an extraordinary sum of money that it was inevitable there would be some scrutiny of what they did. But it wasn't just the sums of money they made. In the vital half an hour before the settlement price was set they were by far the biggest sellers of oil futures in the market which is an incredible thing to think about when you consider that the other participants in that oil market are going to be the world's biggest banks, you know, oil majors BP and Shell and here you have a group of nine guys in Essex who are having this significant influence over a global market for oil. I mean I think you have to assume that if these guys have made seven million or ten million dollars they probably would be celebrating in Essex right now. But the fact that they made closer to 700 million has meant that they are facing understandable scrutiny. We wrote individually to all the all the Vega traders who did exceptionally well that day and we got a letter in response from a law firm representing the group. The law firm was a painstre point out number one that they haven't been accused of any wrong doing that they all traded independently and separately and they'd basically all made up their own mind that this was what was going to happen in oil markets based on publicly available knowledge and decided to execute this trade. What I love about these stories is there's a real variance of opinion and some people will look at what happened and think that must be dodgy they all traded at the end of the day they all made a huge amount of money while all these people lost that's shocking but lots of people say these guys are acute disadvantage they're in a market that's inhabited by huge technology driven funds and firms and oil giants that have got all the advantages in the world and when you get a bunch of Essex geasers who essentially beat the market and find a way to make a huge amount of money they should get a pat on the back really because that's the dream. Since this happened a lot of the guys have stopped trading the monthly settlements that they've done so well out in the past several of them have set up new companies they've essentially gone very quiet you know any kind of social media presence they had is kind of closed down by all accounts there you know waiting this out. It's certainly too early to try and predict how the regulatory investigations are going to pan out you know we just don't know there's a number of potential outcomes for these guys you know potential punishments if there are any findings of manipulation against Vega or anyone affiliated with it might be you could be fined you could be banned from trading and you know in most extreme cases there have even been criminal prosecutions in the past of people who have been found to have been manipulating the settlement and misconduct related to trade settlement. There are other outcomes too you know one obvious one is going to be they're able to walk away from this life-changing trade with all the money that they made and celebrated as heroes in the trading community that you know they'll go down as legends you it's very important given the nature of the climate crisis right now for the general public to have an understanding of what progress is or is not actually happening and I think many readers right now they'll see these hundreds and hundreds of companies making these big bold climate claims",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1916,2022-11-22 17:56:17
19303," Here's right now, they'll see these hundreds and hundreds of companies making these big bold climate claims. And they would be forgiven to think that, you know, we're well on our way to meeting the emission reduction trajectory we need to be on. And the reality of the matter is we're just not on that trajectory. And a key reason for this sort of disconnect is the use of offsets that aren't doing what they claim to be doing. We have a massive potential for sort of willful blindness. We can convince ourselves of things regardless of what the facts are. And so that's what tends to happen in these cases. It's not that anybody is setting out to commit climate fraud. They sort of walk themselves into a situation and they convince themselves of one thing and that allows them to convince themselves of another thing. But at the end of the day, they're doing something that makes no sense at all. My name is Ben Elgin. I wrote the story about how the billion dollar market for carbon offsets is setting back the fight against climate change. So one of the challenges in reporting on carbon offsets and trying to figure out what's going on is really finding good experts who have been steeped in this marketplace and are willing to candidly talk about it. One of the best people for this is a fellow named Mark Trexler. And I've been talking to him for more than a decade. My name is Mark Trexler. I've worked in climate change for the last 30 years. I was actually hired by the World Resources Institute in Washington to work on the first carbon offset project in 1988. In terms of defining a carbon offset that one of the beauties, so to speak, of greenhouse gases, sort of the silver lining of greenhouse gases. When you put up a molecule of CO2 into the atmosphere, it can be anywhere in the planet in seven days. And therefore, if there's an option to reduce emissions on the other side of the planet, and you can do that very cheaply as compared to doing it in your factory, for example, then why not pay that person that factory on the other side of the planet to reduce their emissions. Then you are in a sense offsetting your emissions. And the atmosphere doesn't really see your emissions anymore. So carbon offsets have been been around for quite some time. And they were actually key with these international climate agreements, such as the Kyoto Protocol, which mandated the wealthiest countries reduced their greenhouse gas emissions. The treaty was signed on the 11th of December 1997. The business community in general saw carbon offsets as a huge opportunity to comply with whatever policies and measures might be coming down the pike on climate change much more cost effectively. We've seen a huge surge in companies making big proclamations about how they're going carbon neutral or zeroing out all of their carbon emissions. We're going to reduce our carbon footprint to net zero. Unilever is committing to net zero emissions. We can achieve a net zero emissions world. We began looking at these corporate claims of dramatically reduced emissions. And we noticed so many of these companies were using carbon offsets to achieve these aims. And as we began to look at the carbon offset projects themselves, what we found is that the environmental benefits claimed by these companies are not actually what they seem to be. And as we sort of saw and spotted a number of these very aggressive carbon offset projects which appeared to be generating inflated credits or bogus credits, we saw a number of them were associated with the Nature Conservancy. This surprised us. The Nature Conservancy is the world's biggest environmental group. They have about a billion dollars a year in revenues. And they've been around for seven decades. They've preserved about 125 million acres of land.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1917,2022-11-22 18:00:38
19304," Kevin News. And they've been around for seven decades. They've preserved about 125 million acres of land. They've done so many good works over the years and they've been very strong in terms of working with corporate partners. The nature conservancy has taken a different approach, a very pragmatic and pro-business approach. They will not go out and criticize a big polluter. But they're very happy to work with them. Some might say that well that's selling out. But others would say, and those at the nature conservancy would say, these companies have deep pockets. They can help fund important preservation work. And we have absolutely no problem working with them on this stuff. So companies are very warm and they've partnered with the nature conservancy for many years. And yeah, it definitely lends a sheen of credibility to these projects. Here is 20 NERI, the civilized Disney World this year! If you look at, for instance, Disney. It's a sprawling company with theme parks and cruise lines that burn up. Diesel Fuel. They have office buildings and television studios that consume electricity. So these companies are trying to make major, major reductions in their carbon footprints, but it's very difficult to change these fundamental ways their businesses operate. So Disney has been a big buyer of carbon offsets that are orchestrated by the nature conservancy. One of the projects that they buy from is called Pennsylvania Riges. And that's a plot of land. Most of the land is actually about a three-hour drive outside of Philadelphia. Interestingly, this land, 3,000 of these acres, was actually acquired by the nature conservancy in the late 1990s. This land was eminently threatened. There was a pending logging contract on this land. So they do what they have done so well for all of these years, which is they go out. They raise money from local philanthropists and they go buy this land to protect it from developers and loggers. And at the time, according to an archive version of the Nature Conservancy's website, when they were proudly announcing this deal, they said these threats have been abated because of this acquisition by the Nature Conservancy. So it's really interesting now, fast forward two decades to earlier this year when they put forward this carbon project. And if you look through it, this land is a key part of that carbon project. And what they're now saying is this land is now, once again, eminently threatened. 72% of the trees are going to be cut within five years. Now this is just astounding because this land is owned by the Nature Conservancy. They do not clear-cut land that they've bought through philanthropic donations. So this scenario that they've put forward to get carbon revenues is not really plausible. And what that means is when you have Disney coming in and buying these credits, when it eventually lowers its carbon footprint because of these credits, well, that won't be a credible or truthful claim by Disney. So this is an organization that truly understands the threat of the issue of climate change and is wanting to do its part to address this. However, in this situation, it just appears they're their drive, which they've had for decades, to increase the amount of revenues that it can use for land preservation work. Nature Conservancy and many others see that carbon credits as a pot of money that they can tap into to further their own benevolent aims. But unfortunately, what this has resulted in is claims of climate progress that just aren't really happening. So the Nature Conservancy defends vigorously these deals and they and others will say, look, our projects are just following the rules that these registries set up. So some would also put some of the blame on the registries themselves because they're setting up the rules which allow these vapid projects to get up and sold.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1918,2022-11-22 18:05:04
19305," allow these vapid projects to get up and sold. So we've reached out to all of the companies we mentioned in this story, including Disney. They didn't want to be interviewed for this story, but they all told us that, look, we have to rely on the experts out there, and those experts they say are these carbon registries that have been set up. Most of these nature conservancy deals are set up and sold on this exchange, it's called the American Carbon Registry. Now it's the oldest of these registries that allow voluntary carbon credits to be sold. They've been around since 1996. What these offset registries do is they set up rules and any carbon offset project has to follow those rules, but there's this tension that's always there. If the rules are too strict, then it's going to be very hard for carbon offset projects to get up and running. So there's this balance going on where the registries want rules that attract projects, but they don't want it to be so strict where it will disincentivize projects from getting listed. One of the challenges with designing carbon offset systems is that there are normally two people the table. You have buyers and you have sellers. And to some extent you have policy makers, but but the buyers and the sellers are really the ones with the expertise, with the incentive to really participate hard, make a lot of things happen. And the challenge there is is that both of them sort of want the same thing, or they're both happy with the same thing. They're happy with low-cost offsets and a lot of them, because that works for their business model. You end up, though, with nobody really representing the atmosphere, so to speak. Nobody's really representing the climate in those discussions. And so the policies end up biasing the whole system. And you end up in sort of a race to the bottom. And that's what we've seen happen. When it comes specifically to the topic of carbon offsets, I am a fan of carbon offsets in the sense that they can help mitigate climate change. They absolutely can. But if we're not going to do it correctly in a way that actually does help mitigate climate change, then it's nothing but a distraction. And after 30 years, you have to start wondering, is it really just a distraction? And that's really unfortunate, but that's where we are. Ultimately, what needs to happen is systemic change. We're sort of nibbling around the edges with some of these different things. We need to change how we produce energy. We need to change how we transport ourselves. We need to change what and how we eat. We need systemic change associated with transitioning to a low carbon economy. A lot of what we're doing today is not promoting systemic change. It's sort of trying to stick your thumb in the dike to preserve the current system. And at the end of the day, that can't really work.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1919,2022-11-22 18:09:36
19306," The Hyperloop. There's a good chance you've heard the name by now. This is the Hyperloop system. It can take people hundreds of miles in minutes. The Hyperloop is a series of tubes that would transport people in pods at ultra high speeds over long distances. This is a remarkable new form of transportation that can whisk people from city to city in a flash. 29 minutes from New York to DC, 30 minutes from LA to San Francisco. For years we've been seeing these futuristic utopian renderings of some cross between a spaceship and a monogale. But lately, the Hyperloop is becoming much more real. It was surreal to be sitting inside a Hyperloop and just even more incredible to actually be riding down a track in something that was nothing more than a crazy idea six years before. Companies all around the world have been developing and testing the technology needed to propel passengers speeds of over 1,000 kilometers per hour. But for many, speed is only the first step to unlocking the full transformational effects of a new mode of transportation. Fast is what we just sort of take for granted in the Hyperloop world. It's the network effects that really deliver the benefit and that opens up a completely different scale of economic opportunity. It means we're getting around Earth. What if there was a fifth mode? I have a name for it, which is called the Hyperloop. In 2013 while riding high on the growing success of Tesla and SpaceX, entrepreneur Elon Musk released a white paper outlining the basic framework of the technology he called Hyperloop. The basic idea goes a little something like this. A tube reduces the air pressure to a near vacuum like environment. A Hyperloop pod is then suspended in the tube, usually by magnetic levitation. The whole pod can then be propelled forward. Because there's no traditional friction sources like air resistance or rolling friction that would push back against the pod, the Hyperloop is able to move at incredibly high speeds and do so fairly efficiently. Despite its futuristic name, however, the general concept behind Hyperloop is actually pretty old. In fact, New York City's first attempt at an underground public transit system in the 1870s was based on a similar principle. The pneumatic transit system was short lived, however, only stretching one block and topping out at a rather leisurely 10 miles per hour. While Elon would make some 21st century improvements to this concept and bestow a very 21st century name, he wouldn't end up pursuing the technology itself, instead electing to focus his efforts on something a little bit deeper, literally digging the requisite tunnels by a his boring company. It would take another billionaire industrialist who dabbles in spaceflight, no way not that one. Yeah, that's the one. After Richard Branson would make a large investment in the company Hyperloop 1, it would be renamed to Virgin Hyperloop. What we've always been trying to do as a company is show that this technology could work, that it could be made safe, and that ultimately it's something that's happening in the next couple of years, not the next 20 years. Josh Geigel is the co-founder and CEO of Virgin Hyperloop. In a familiar tech startup story, he's seen the project go from a garage to a large scale testing facility outside of Las Vegas. So we started building the first kind of Hyperloop system in 2016. We've done a lot of work, about a 500 tests that we've done on that over the last five years. And what we realized that we need to do is take that technology, show that it can be commercial, so drive the cost down, improve the efficiency, improve the performance. And the key thing is, is actually making it approachable and safe.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1920,2022-11-22 18:13:45
19307," That's all. Invisioning the ripple effects of what Hyperloop could achieve, though, is fairly challenging at this stage of development. It's fast, yes, but for point-to-point travel, traditional maglev trains can move pretty fast as well. And outside of China, South Korea, and Japan, even those haven't seen much adoption elsewhere due to the high costs and questionable profitability. The Shanghai Line in China, for example, loses around $100 million every year. Hyperloop companies, however, believe they can offer something different than traditional railway lines. My name's Alan James, and as far as I know, I'm the only guy on the planet who's written the government-level business case for 300 kmh conventional high-speed rail. 500 kmh maglev and 1000 kmh Hyperloop. It's fundamentally about moving people from where they are, to where they want to go, when they want to make those journeys, and doing it in much smaller numbers. So pod designs for Hyperloop range from 12 to 28 seats, typically. Why are they small? It's because small enables the network to operate flexibly. And a great example of that is the East West strategic route across the north of England, from Liverpool to Manchester to Leeds. So to get from Liverpool via Manchester to Leeds by train is just short of two hours today. It'll probably take you two hours driving as well in average traffic conditions. That result is those three city regions remain three separate entities. Liverpool Manchester Leeds, there's very little commuting traffic between those urban areas. Hyperloop absolutely changes that from the ground up. Liverpool to Manchester is a five or six minute journey. Manchester to Leeds is also a five or six minute journey. What effectively does is create a single super city economy. In this vision, the Hyperloop acts a little more like a highway, where pods have fixed destinations and don't need to stop along the way. Meaning you can travel on a Hyperloop network from say Liverpool to Leeds, while the pod behind you travels from Liverpool to Manchester. And if that Metro Hyperloop network is connected to other networks from the same location, you could travel from Liverpool to Paris or Liverpool to Amsterdam, all without making a single stop. For passengers, for business, for leisure, that is utterly transformational. For high-value freight and logistics, it's equally transformational. But critically, if you do a Hyperloop network at scale, you begin to deliver massively significant carbon savings to it. A multi-regional Hyperloop network could become a replacement for both short haul passenger and cargo flights and traditional ground transportation, both of which are significant carbon producers. One Hyperloop-connected distribution hub, perhaps at an airport that is predominantly used for international air freight, replacing maybe 10, 12, 15 distributed road hubs. It takes a lot of polluting and inefficient truck haulage off the roads. That itself means roads gain extra capacity. Hyperloups will still need to use electricity to both move pods and maintain the near-vacuum environment and the tube. Proponents of the technology believe that this can be done by using renewable sources, including a combination of solar panels, and solar panels.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1921,2022-11-22 18:20:52
19308," move pods and maintain the near-vacuum environment and the tube. Proponents of the technology believe that this could be done by using renewable sources, including a combination of solar panels and battery technology that could be used along the hyperloop itself. But even with all multipliers of time and carbon emission savings that a hyperloop network may provide, the investment capital required to actually build such a network becomes even more economically and politically daunting. Committing doesn't mean spending billions on day one. Committing means how do we phase it? One company in the Netherlands is working to develop that technology, and perhaps more importantly, the international coalition needed to make the hyperloop network a reality. So we are here in Europe's first full-scale hyperloop test facility, where we can already prove every conceptual technology of the hyperloop. This is Tim Houter, a co-founder and CEO of Heart Hyperloop, headquartered in the city of Delft. And while this testing tube might not seem as large as others, inside is a key technology to create the on and off-ramp type infrastructure of a hyperloop network, that is, a lane switch. That's something we can already test here. You can actually see it here. Then the track is diverging from one track into two. The next possible to eventually split up the hyperloop track into two sections, and in that sense you can create a complete hyperloop network, but in the end, we'll make it possible to travel, for example, over a whole continent. I think Europe, for example, with the same ease as you can out travel with a metro in the city. The nice thing about this magnetic-labitation system that we have developed is that there's absolutely zero moving components in the track. So, for example, if you have to do a lane switch, all you do is that the tube basically splits up, and statically, the tracks also split up, and whenever the vehicle enters a switch, it either pulls itself to the right with its magnets, or pulls itself to the left with its magnets. Lane switching on traditional rail requires the physical movement of the rail. Even modern magnetic-labitation tracks use lane switching techniques in order to transfer trains from one track to another. And this is a very crucial element, and this is the thing that limits the capacity, and in the end, the usefulness of the rail network. Because the moment that a track is switching, that means that at that moment you are creating an unsafe environment for the trains behind it. So you need a lot of space between trains. In a hyperloop, because you have no moving components in the track, all the vehicles can be much closer to each other, you can achieve a very high frequency, and the vehicles moving and merging in and out of the network very much like a highway. For now though, Hart's physical testing has been limited by the size of their tube. Because the test track is only 30 meters long, they haven't tested this lane switch at speeds greater than 20 kilometers per hour. However, the company is working to build a new test site, where it plans to increase that testing speed to 300 kilometers per hour. We're now in a phase where we have proven most of the most important technologies, in the test facilities that we already have, and we have also demonstrated the viability and the feasibility of a network. If you look at all the top systems that it consists of, most of those are proven systems, already demonstrated in lab conditions. So we don't really believe that the technology itself is going to be the biggest challenge. Because for all hyperloop companies out there, actually building a hyperloop system requires more than just a good product. We're talking about the safety aspects, we're talking about integration into the environment, we're talking about the social aspects, do people feel comfortable traveling in such a system. So it's about all these different aspects, and the complexity is really getting all the different stakeholders that are relevant and that they need to contribute to bring this to market, to get them all following the same roadmap.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1922,2022-11-22 18:25:16
19309," to get them all following the same roadmap. In order to help build this coalition of private and public interest in hyperlip development, HART in 2018 partnered with other hyperlip companies from Europe and Canada. The goal was to define, establish and standardize the framework to regulate hyperlip systems. Right now we are working with all the hyperlip developers together in setting up the first structure for starting the standards drafting. One of the most important goals for HART is interoperability, which is essentially making sure the different systems can communicate with each other. Interoperability is so important because what we want to achieve is actually have this seamless travel experience. So you don't want to end up, for example, going from Madrid to Paris and then switching because you need to use a different technology to get, for example, to answer them. The idea being that as companies around Europe create the first commercial hyperlip tracks between individual cities, one day those can all be connected to a larger network. Everyone that believes that hyperlip is a future transport system also realizes that there is a need to have this network because that's where hyperlip thrives. Hyperlip is such a huge project. It's definitely not something that you can do in your own or as a single company. So you need to do it with a lot of other companies. You need to have the governments. I think in that sense the biggest challenge that we've encountered is to really get all the required parties together to take the steps in development and in commercial implementation. Hart's next plan is to build the European Hyperlip Center, an open testing facility which will include a 2.6 kilometer test track. And the company hopes to test travel speeds there at up to 700 kilometers per hour. Virgin Hyperlip is also racing to construct the first commercial hyperlip route, with projects in various states of development in India, Saudi Arabia, and the United States. Recently the company announced plans to build a Hyperlip certification center in West Virginia, which will include a 6 mile long test track. Proving the technology here will be crucial if Hyperlip networks can find a home among infrastructure investments that the Biden administration hopes to make. The idea that there's multiple Hyperlip companies, I think is a redeeming aspect in the business. People really want to see something happen, so having multiple people move forward is good for that. I was struck when Josh and Sarah rode the pod. Two or three of the major outlets used the phrase, we now have a new mode of transport. And although all of that technology had existed before those two human beings rode it, it was the moment at which those two human beings traveled that short distance down the tube that in popular imagination Hyperlip became a mode of transport. The metaphor I use with my team is that the Wright brothers refers, but none of us fly on Wright brothers' airlines anymore. If you don't continue to innovate, you're not going to be around, so we'll continue to be at the forefront of building Hyperlip. Back in 2013, Elon had an idea. I think the difference now in 2021 is some brilliant engineers have spent real time grinding out the details. And I thoroughly expect the next three to five years to be decisive.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1923,2022-11-22 18:29:29
19310," You You This week, how hydrogen can transform our energy usage. We'll look at why the universe's most abundant element could be a game changer in the climate revolution. Hydrogen technologies are not new. They are used in other sectors. We use them in space on our rockets and we don't need the laws of physics to change to be able to use hydrogen on our planes. From iron ore to green hydrogen, one of Australia's richest men tells us about his pivot to sustainable energy. Let's take action. It's practical. It's implementable. Let's do it now. Plus, the hydrogen revolution. We'll speak with the CEO of Italian Utilities firm Snam about his new book and how green hydrogen could be competitive within five years. Cossacks are coming down and people are waking up to the fact that it's the only way to decarbonize certain sectors. From Bloomberg's Global Headquarters in New York, I'm Kayleigh Lyons and this is Bloomberg Green. It's a new year, so here at Bloomberg Green we're highlighting new solutions in the fight against climate change. And one of those is as old as the universe itself. Hydrogen. It's the simplest element around but could well be a game changer when it comes to turning around our dependence on fossil fuels. Today, hydrogen is used in the chemicals industry to produce petroleum products. It's also starting to be used in steel production and industry under a lot of pressure to decarbonize. But it has far more uses as well, from powering cars to heating our homes. And Bloomberg New Energy Finance sees a seismic shift in the sector in the next 10 years as green hydrogen squeezes out dirtier alternatives. So-called grey hydrogen dominates today. But as renewable electricity gets cheaper and more accessible, so we'll green hydrogen. In this week's edition of Bloomberg Green, we'll explore what this push into hydrogen means for tackling climate change. We'll hear from Australian billionaire Twiggy Forest about his pivot from Iron War II Hydrogen. We'll also speak with the CEO of Italian utility company Svamm about his book, The Hydrogen Revolution. But first, what are we using hydrogen for? And why does it actually matter?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1924,2022-11-22 18:34:05
19311," of Italian utility companies spam about his book, The Hydrogen Revolution. But first, what are we using hydrogen for? And why does it actually matter? Christine Lee Edwards explains. Hydrogen, the most plentiful element in the universe. On Earth, we find that mostly bonded to oxygen in the form of water. Or in other gases known as hydrocarbons. Hydrogen gas, H2, burns hot and clean, making it an attractive tool in the race to net zero. But isolating hydrogen from other elements is no easy task. Today, the cheapest way to do this is via chemical processes that break up natural gas. This releases a lot of carbon dioxide. Another method is to use electricity to split water molecules in a process called electrolysis. Although there is no carbon byproduct, a lot of electricity is needed. And if this power comes from burning coal or gas, it negates to zero emissions goals of using hydrogen to begin with. Hydrogen produced in this way, power by fossil fuels, is called gray hydrogen. If carbon capture and storage is used together with fossil fuels, then it becomes blue hydrogen. If nuclear power is used, it's called pink. And finally, green hydrogen is what is produced via electrolysis and powered from renewable sources. This method is considered emissions free. It's predicted that by the early 2030s, H2 made from renewables will be cheaper than that made from fossil fuels. But that hinges on the cost of electrolysis declining, which will be achieved through larger projects and an expansion of manufacturing. To be clear, vast amounts of H2 are already used today. Global production in 2018 totaled 117 million metric tons. This hydrogen is mostly used for its chemical properties, not as a source of energy, and very little of it is clean. Some sectors like steel could start using hydrogen for these chemical properties, replacing coal. Industries like cement and glass may also use hydrogen as a source of heat. Another advantage is its energy storage potential. It can be stored over long periods of time and used when more power needs to be added to the grid. It also could hold an advantage over batteries and heavy transport and shipment. The promise of hydrogen for energy has been around since at least 1874, when Jules Verne wrote about it in his book, The Mysterious Island. But the future of hydrogen will depend on policy. Countries with net zero targets, carbon pricing and hydrogen strategies with investment mechanisms are likely to see the highest H2 demand. That was Bloomberg's Christine Lee Edwards explaining what hydrogen means for the energy transition. But how are businesses approaching the sector? Well, one of Australia's richest men is making a big play into hydrogen. Andrew Forrest, better known as Twiggy, made his fortune from iron ore, being the chairman, former CEO and major shareholder in Fortescue Metals, one of the world's biggest miners. But after having made over $10 billion in profit from the metal in the last fiscal year, Twiggy wants to transform Fortescue into a clean energy company. He's been scouring the planet in search of investment opportunities in hydrogen and renewables. The firm plans to allocate up to 10% of its annual profits for green energy investments and is exploring projects across the globe from Indonesia to Argentina. Prancing Laquah caught up with Twiggy Forrest. There's only one type of clean hydrogen, all the rest is dirty. That is great. If you just say, green hydrogen is clean, the rest is dirty, then you've actually nailed it. Anyone else who produces any other rubbish, any other egg, would just look at the answer, why is global warming accelerating if anything you're saying is true? And then you'll know, actually, it's greenwashing. Yeah, but there's a lot of greenwashing because I keep on being told it's a transition. We can't just make the transition at a click of a finger. So what are we doing wrong? What can we do better? I don't remember the personal computer having to transition the typewriter. I really don't remember that. I don't remember the smartphone having to transition the pocket calculator and the old landline. Transition line is complete rubbish.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1925,2022-11-22 18:38:15
19312," I don't remember the smartphone having to transition the pocket calculator and the old landline. Transition line is complete rubbish. The lie got put to it. Two days ago when JCB, a really loved British company, you and every right for the country to be proud of JCB, and Fortescue, holding a bit of a similar reputation, fantastic track record, everything, super well from Fortescue, huge balance sheet, super strong. When those two companies got together and agreed at $79 billion USD on Greenwood, per atom, right, then that's a real wake up call to say, hang on. Greenhagen is obviously commercial now. Every other form of fossil fuel, fossil fuel hydrogen, you know, it can compete with it on price, it can probably lose on price, but what we know, it is cooking the planet. And only Greenhagen zero methane, zero carbon in the supply chain. Don't worry about the molecules in the supply chain. But at the moment, we're not even facing out call if you look at the G20 company case. So we have a long way to go to talk about only using Greenhagen. Yeah, so look, I have a call, which I'd like to make now, that the world should not fund any more carbon power stations, coal mining projects, ever wish you'd wind them down as quickly as possible, because they are cooking the planet just like Greyhagen is cooking the planet. You know, you have had them to not make renewable electricity, releasing 10 to 16 times more carbon, let them on the methane, which is worse than it is hydrogen. So we've just got to stop doing things which are self-harming under the guise of Greenhagen. So why are leaders so slow, even if you look at the appetite for eSG investments, they're growing exponentially, so are emissions, so where are we allocating capital? Okay, so take the recent G20. There's probably a reason why there wasn't strong action coming out of the G20, because people were not aware that major transactions between large companies were taking place now on Greenhagen, that actually this pollution-free all the way to the supply chain fuel was now being transacted at multi-billion dollar scale. If that none that I don't believe any sovereign leader or any energy minister or climate change minister could not take ultra-seriously, that Greenhagen is never here to stay, it's broken through, history has been made, it will never go back. Okay, what is the one thing that you would tell leaders today and business leaders? How do we transition faster than what we are now, because we're at real risk of missing our targets? So that's really simple. Do you stop funding, do you stop subsidizing, do you stop using money into possibly? Right. It could be carbon sequestration, it could be fuel rebates could be anything. Hundreds of billions of dollars getting ashed, while we ask the planet on fossil fuel subsidies, because we haven't had that renewable energy, we haven't had that Greenhagen, it's kind of been pushed down, pushed down, it's also subscruces, are never being commercial, it never be supplied in the quantities we needed, and I'm glad I'm glad, now we know, let's take action, it's practical, it's implementable, let's do it now. Okay, if we do it now, is there going to be a shock to the energy system? Is there going to be a shock actually to economically, and is it worth not talking about transition, just going from 8 to B? Yeah, it's a fantastic person, 8 to B is the solution, let fossil fuels do what fossil fuels do, just burn their coal, burn their ore, burn their gas, at least they're pumping up carbon and methane into the atmosphere, honestly. Well, not that honest, because they don't mention methane, which is 90 times worse than carbon. Yeah. At least the carbon is being done honestly, encourage the green hydrogen sector to come in really fast, it's there, there's renewable power all over the world, we know how to make electrolyzes much cheaper, 25% of the original cost, we know how to do that now, we don't have an excuse to get into it. Does it need to be cheaper than oil and fossil fuel for it to be viable worldwide? Well, right now is, so let's just swallow that bit of financial data, right now is cheaper, and it's getting more cheap, it's getting more expensive,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1926,2022-11-22 18:42:39
19313," Now, it is cheaper and it's getting more check. It's the only fuel you know. Mr. Froscher. Just declining in value. You don't have enough of it. Right, to power the world. Ah yes, that's only because we haven't had policies to support. We had policies to support it five, ten years ago. It would be everywhere. You'd see the global warming budget start to come down. Now, we've got five or ten years to make a huge difference. And it's policy that's more over the world. To appreciate now, OK, big business is transacting with green hydrogen in multi-billion dollar agreements. We now know it's here and it's here to state that's spread everywhere. Coming up on the program, the hydrogen revolution. We'll speak with the CEO of Italian utility firm Snam about his new book and why he thinks green hydrogen will be competitive in just five years. Plus, how are airlines working to become more sustainable? We'll look at how Airbus plans to step up in the climate fight. And this is the green. And this is the green. And this is the green. And this is the green. And this is the green. And this is the green. And this is the green. And this is the green. From Bloomberg's world headquarters in New York, I'm Kayleigh Lines. And this is Bloomberg Green. What will the world look like in 2050? Will global temperatures have stabilized? Electric vehicles be abundant? And solar and wind power homes around the world? According to Marco Alvera, the CEO of Italian Energy Company Snam, that vision of the future could be a reality. And he says that hydrogen will pay its way. As he tells it in his new book, The Hydrogen Revolution, Alvera's moment of reckoning came in November 2018, when he tasked the Snam scenarios team, with studying how Europe could reduce its CO2 emissions to zero by 2050. Looking through the results of the study, Alvera said he was struck by how much hydrogen was in Europe's energy mixed by that year. Beyond the abundance of hydrogen, the Snam model also predicted that it would be the cheapest form of decarbonized energy for many sectors, and that it could be cheaper than today's prices for oil, coal, and nuclear power. Our Maria today is spoke with Alvera at COP26. It's happening all very fast. We see the cost of hydrogen coming down a lot. Hydrogen will play a big role in the energy mix. I don't know if it's going to be 15 or 25% of a fully decarbonized energy system, but it's going to be big.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1927,2022-11-22 18:46:57
19314," In our 25% of the fully decarbonized energy system, but it's going to be big. Coss are coming down and people are waking up to the fact that it's the only way to decarbonize certain sectors, so called hard to abate sectors. And you say it's the only way in the cost are coming down. Where do you see prices moving? Because a lot of the reticence of times has to do with the pricing. That some argue will still not have the cheapest option out of the market. So when I was first working in hydrogen in 2004, it was costing $1,000 per megaveh at hour. 2010, 600. Today, 100. And we see it going down to 50 and five years' time and to going down to $25 per megaveh at hour in the next 10 years or so. Which is a quarter of word as today. That's really because renewable energy, and we're talking green hydrogen here. Renewable energy costs are falling. But the cost of making the electrolyzer, which is the kit that you use to convert solar or wind energy and water into hydrogen, the cost of this kit is falling a lot because it doesn't really exist on an industrial scale. So as we build up capacity, we industrialize it, we standardize it and we squeeze costs out. That's really the cost trajectory. And for that, of course, you need demand, however, for governments and also institutions to kind of buy into this idea that it is a future and we want to invest in creating infrastructure. What are they telling you? When you speak to governments, when you speak to officials, are they keen on this? They're very keen. So the Department of Energy shares our view in the states of getting to below $1 a kilo, which is $25 a megaveh at hour. The European Union has hydrogen strategy, which is very clear. And several member states have the same. Chile wants to export a lot of hydrogen. China's big on hydrogen. Australia's very big on hydrogen. Japan is blending already hydrogen. So I would say the world is now really focused on this because it's the only way to store energy for a long period of time economically is to convert it into either a liquid or a gas. And of course, you talk about the price, but the other big component is the volume, you know, how big can you go? Where do you see that on a time scale? So wherever it's sunny or windy, you can produce very cheap hydrogen eventually. And so compared to oil and gas, which are concentrated in a few parts of the world, it's going to be very democratic from that point of view. So every sunny place, every desert, every ocean wind, can be turned into hydrogen that we can put on ships, in pipes and really start trading it around the world. So it's going to happen a lot faster than a lot of people think. So, and we say a lot faster? What is that in time? As they said, $50, which is essentially oil parity within five years. And then depending on how quickly we ramp it up after that, we could get to $25, which is coal parity before the end of the decade. And in big scale. In big scale, because once you get to coal parity, that's the only way we're going to get China and India to stop burning new coal. We have businesses in China and in India. And I see a lot of hydrogen development, a lot of renewable development in both countries. The Indian announcement was incredibly strong on 2030. Some people were upset about the 2017 at zero deadline, but when it comes to 30, he announced a big, big commitment to get to 50% of the new coal. Where is the price? I was surprised that they would make it so explicit. And even the net zero is a big thing for them. And so I think it will happen faster than 2070 because of the falling cost of renewable and hydrogen. India's burning 80 gigawatt of oil of diesel to keep the lights on. So there's an immediate opportunity there. And we're very interested in working that country. And with regards to China, perhaps the fact that we haven't really seen them active, I guess the diplomats are working on this, but we haven't really seen the leadership. It's going to be technology. It's going to be industry. I think China has committed to a net zero, which is very important. At the G20, China was clearly behind the one and a half degrees. So I think a lot has been achieved between the G20 and COP. And I think what's really important is to see in the coming years, how quick it's in our hands to make part of this happen in five years or could otherwise happen in 15, 20 years. It's about building the project. The capital is there. We saw how many trillions of dollars are already committed. What's missing is really the projects. And that's where companies like us step in. Marco Alvera, CEO of Snam there, speaking with our Maria today. Let's turn now to the aviation industry. It's a big contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions and its under pressure to change that. In October, the International Air Transport Association, a trade body representing airlines, approved a target of achieving net zero emissions by 2050. To achieve that, many airlines in the US and Europe are looking to buy sustainable aviation fuel made from renewable sources like used vegetable oil. And it should have like these.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1928,2022-11-22 18:51:35
19315," To achieve that, many airlines in the US and Europe are looking to buy sustainable aviation fuel made from renewable sources like used vegetable oil. Initiatives like these are pushing plane makers to come up with some radical new aircraft that will eventually cater to our growing appetite for travel without hurting the environment. We took a look at how Airbus, the world's number two aircraft manufacturer, is stepping up to the challenge. How long until we can fly emission free? Airbus says it's more confident by the day it can be done by its 2035 target. Airbus a CEO spoke about its ambitions for hydrogen-powered planes at the company's summit in France. The physics works. Hydrogen technologies are not new. They are used in other sectors. We use them in space on our rockets and we don't need the laws of physics to change to be able to use hydrogen on our planes. So every day we become more confident. But we think we need to have a plane. We need to have the right fuels, the hydrogen available in the right quantity at the right place at the right time. And we need the regulations to be ready. So we really need the work and the collaboration of many people on the globe to make it happen on time. But it could be a long wait until green passenger jets go mainstream. Larger aircraft with more than 150 seats are not expected to feature globally until about 2050. That means manufacturers and airlines today are under growing pressure to ramp up short-term innovations to cut their carbon. In a long term, meeting the ambitious plans for so-called green hydrogen means building a giant industry almost from scratch. To make that happen, British airline EasyJet is among those saying governments need to get involved and fast. Aviation submissions over the last three decades leading up to the pandemic grew by about 80% to over 1 gigaton, and that's projected to double by 2050. According to Bloomberg, any F, about half of the airlines with the largest global market share have set net zero targets by that same date nearly three decades away. Coming up from Blue Sky projects to the bottom line, we'll speak with our Bloomberg NEF expert Meredith Annex and dig into their models about how hydrogen fits into the future energy mix. This is Bloomberg Green.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1929,2022-11-22 18:55:56
19316," [♪ OUTRO MUSIC PLAYING [♪ From Bloomberg's World Headquarters in New York, I'm Kaley Lines, and this is Bloomberg Green. Now let's bring in Meredith Annex, our Bloomberg N-E-F Hydrogen Specialist to talk more about how hydrogen could change the energy landscape. So Meredith, what place do you think hydrogen is likely to have in the future energy mix globally? Hydrogen is this incredible solution for us as we look to decarbonize because it's a perfect solution in areas that are hard to electrify. So we're really like to think about hydrogen playing a role. It's in things like heavy industry, especially where you need a feedstock, as well as energy source. And in things like dispatchable power, long-called transport, maybe even shipping and aviation. That sounds great that it can be used for such diverse industries. At the end of the day, though, how much is this going to cost? Well, that's the amazing thing about hydrogen because depending on how you make it, it can actually see significant cost of clients in the future. So when we're talking about clean hydrogen, we usually mean green hydrogen produced for renewable electricity. And in that case, your hydrogen is almost as cheap as the renewables that are used to make it. So if you're in a place with really good renewable resources, you'll be able to have cheaper hydrogen. But even in places with less good resources, we think that hydrogen can be cheaper than a dollar per kilogram, which is the price of unabated hydrogen today, and around $8 per million BTUs for those who prefer to think in energy units. And that can be achieved anywhere in the world by 2050, we believe. All right, so let's talk about kind of the pros and cons list. I don't know where cost fits into that. But what are the advantages to hydrogen over other renewables and then what are the drawbacks? Yeah, main advantage is the fact that hydrogen can serve roles that electron struggle with. And that's things like seasonal storage, for instance, or just anything where you need storeability, where your electrons are harder to store, hydrogen is going to be easier. That also leads to a downside though, because hydrogen is less energy dense than the usual things that we use for storeable energy today like coal or oil or natural gas. So you will need more volume of storage to handle the same amount of energy. Let's talk about the viability as well and how it may differ in different geographies. What is your view on that? Yeah, so for green hydrogen again from renewable electricity, really places with the best renewable resources, things like Latin America, or the Middle East, even southern Europe have really, really good potential for producing hydrogen. And then when you're looking at blue hydrogen, which is produced from natural gas or coal with carbon-caption storage, we do see that becoming more expensive than green hydrogen in the future, especially as renewable electricity costs come down. But that can be a viable option in places like the US Gulf Coast or Russia, where you've got good geological storage for the carbon, and as well as ample natural gas that's quite cheap. All right, great breakdown. Thank you so much to our Meredith Annex, our Bloomberg NEF Hydrogen Specialist, and of course you can get more from the Bloomberg NEF team on the terminal and online. And they've recently done a podcast called Hydrogen 101 as part of its switched on series. So from iron ore titans pivoting to cleaner energy to talk of a hydrogen revolution, that's it from the Suix edition of Bloomberg Green. We'll be back next week with a deep dive into the state of electric vehicles. And you can keep the conversation going by following us on YouTube, Instagram, and Twitter at Climate.

19317," my This is Bloomberg Business Week. Inside from the reporters and editors who bring you America's most trusted business magazine, plus global business finance and tech news as it happens. Bloomberg Business Week, with Carol Messer and Bloomberg Quick Takes Tim Stenevick on Bloomberg Radio. And very good afternoon everybody. Live from the Bloomberg Interactive Brokers Studio. Struving on YouTube, we are also on Bloomberg Quick Takes, Carol Messer along with Tim Stenevick. And we've got an update here on the stock market. Yes, stocks rising. We got a weaker dollar. We got up the earnings and some retailers using treasury yields. Carol investors are thinking yes, higher rates, but perhaps at a slower pace. We're going to hear from some of those Fed speakers a little bit later on. Also ahead, we have the most incredible gas, considering the news flow and backdrop. In fact, the perfect gas from FDX and SBF to GBTC, coin, Tesla and Twitter. We are talking Kathy Wood. Because she has invested in all of them. That was like an alphabet soup. We're going to talk to her, get her perspective. So really looking forward to that. It's going to be a deep dive conversation. So stick around. Several stocks on her radar. We're going to have more of the Disney CEO do over and bring back, I guess you could say. And then beyond meets dirty plant. Yeah, a deep dive from Tina Shanker a little later in the program. And then Tesla's China Revent Plus. Why Canada is the place to watch when it comes to global housing meltdowns? Yeah, and then we've got the public sector via Washington having its eyes on the private sector. We're talking really private equity. All of that to come. We begin with a check on the trading day. Here is Charlie Pellet. I thank you very much, Carol. And so we've got stocks flying higher right now with the Dow, the S&P and Nezdaq all advancing. Just about the best level of the day right now is investors recalibrate their expectations in response to federal officials indicating that they will continue to raise rates. But are open to slowing their tempo. The S&P now up 40. The best level of the day there up by 1% the Dow up 323 higher now by 1% Nezdaq the composite index of 103 up by 9. 10 sub 1% Nezdaq 100 index up 1% Bitcoin up 3.1% and the 10 year yield 3.75% the two year 4.51%. Spot gold flat on the day right now at 1783 the ounce West Texas in the media crude up 1.1% $80.92 a barrel on WTI. The rapid collapse of Sam Bankman freed's crypto empire has sent a shock across the area industry that have been a poster child for market access. Sources say digital asset brokerage genesis is warning potential investors. It may need to file for bankruptcy if it's fundraising efforts fail. SD Dweck is chief investment officer of FlowBranque and on Bloomberg radio and television this morning. She was asked if she sees further fallouts stemming from the crypto meltdown. At this point it doesn't appear likely. We've already had almost a week of these headlines. We've seen that some of the big cryptos like Bitcoin have surprisingly still held up decently and we haven't seen that much contagion across the spectrum into the equity market. So it does feel like it's going to stay contained into crypto and Bitcoin right now up 3.1% 16,113 back above the 16,000 threshold. The topic we will have more on for you coming up on Bloomberg.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1931,2022-11-22 19:04:36
19318," And Bitcoin right now up 3.1% 16,113 back above the 16,000 threshold. A topic we will have more on for you coming up on Bloomberg Business Week. Retailer earnings, lots of them briefly. Avocrombe and Fitch up 19.2%. We have got best by up 10.9%. American Eagle Outfitters up by 17.5% Dick Sporting Goods up now by 8%. I'm Charlie Pellett and that is a Bloomberg Business Flash. Alright Charlie, thank you so much. Alright let's get to it folks. Let's get to the Market Drivers Report. Let's set your Business Week agenda on yet. It's a holiday we put. Any moment. I'm going to put that out there. In the house, Creedicoop Da Anchor and Market's correspondent. Bloomberg, here at our Interracurator Broker Studio, along with Abigail Doe, little Market supporter at Bloomberg News. So Creedee, set the tone. It's an update. What kind of volume do we have? It's an update. A whole lot of nothing when it comes to volume. Let's just take a look at the 5-day average, which is kind of my go-to metric. Last time I checked for the S&P 500, it was down about 10%. Now it looks like it's down about 15%. So you are starting to see volume drop off as we get closer and closer to the end of the day. And that makes sense. You're seeing it in the bond market as well, which also explains why this stock market is kind of on auto-pilot right now. Despite the fact that some of these earnings are still rolling out. And you had Zoom come out. You had upgrades and downgrades from Airbnb and Activision as well. So there are some individual stock movers too. Well that has actually peaked my interest in Charlie Pellet just hit some of those numbers. The companies that reported this morning, including Abercrombie and Fitch, Dix, Best Buy, and more Abigail, showing that. I think they're shopping less than in an afternoon, right? They should be so good. This is the ANS set. I would love to see you tim in the ANS. Let's not go back to my high school day with cargo shorts with Abercrombie and Fitch. Yeah, that would be good. I'll be in the next year. I guess they've done a revamp since the 1990s. What do you have your eye on, Abigail? It's a lot of fun. I'm glad you're here. I'm glad you're here. It's good to see you. But you bought the Abercrombie and Fitch Cologne. Totally. It's so funny with Abercrombie and Fitch, I just feel as though this company's gone through so many different iterations. And it's either hotter, cold, it's either really working or not working, fashion, writer, fashion, wrong. Apparently right now it's fashion, right? I've not seen one in years. But yeah, relatively to volume, it's nothing. I look at it relative to the 20 day average and it's about 30% below that. So we are really looking at this anemic holiday, short and weak trading volume. It just feels as though sometimes investors want to take stocks in a certain direction. And there's been so much talk about the bear market rally. And the DAX went above the 200 day moving average to the bull market. It feels as though the S&P 500 for a lack of better way to put it is almost on cruise control to go up. We have yields down. We have the dollar down, light volume. I wouldn't be surprised to see that happen over the next couple of days. The question then is, if the S&P 500 does get to resistance, does it go over? It has not this year really in any kind of sustained way, or is it contained again? You know what happens? You can like leave a car and cruise control. You can't say anything. Just say you're not paying attention. So do we kind of write off this week, because it's a holiday, short and trading week, and I don't know. I mean, you should never write off anything. But, well, I mean, you know what I mean. People invested are making money today, right? If you're long. So that's true. Not necessarily a worth writing off. But, certainly, something that we could see paired back next week. And I think the reason next week is so crucial is because something no one's even talking about today, which is the rail strike. And it's really important, because it is on the horizon. It's coming up as soon as December 5th, for some of the unions, December 9th for the majority. And this is significant, because after Thanksgiving is one of these couriers and railroads are going to start halting their shipments if they don't see any progress. And that might show up into the investment thesis going into next week. Of course, they haven't started doing that yet. They're planning on doing that. They said after Thanksgiving. So the week between a potential strike and after Thanksgiving is next week. And I think that's where you could perhaps see it impact some sentiment and certainly impact some of the bigger movers in the Dow even, the big railroads. So is that the biggest thing you're focused on? I mean, that's something that you think investors are ignoring right now? It's something that I think in the US should be kept on the horizon. The OPEC story, December 4th, is coming up as well. There's been a lot of rumors about a potential hike. Saudi Arabia has to deny those. OPEC has not, which I think is really crucial. Saudi Arabia is not the only player there. They are also trying to win some good well with the Biden administration. There's a lot going on that could really change.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1932,2022-11-22 19:09:11
19319," It's really crucial. Sadio Rabia is not the only player there. There are also trying to win some good well with the Biden administration. There's a lot going on that could really change what the market is priced for. And the market right now is still priced for higher oil prices and a very hawkish federal reserve. All right. So having said that, any signs that go against that, I do wonder if Abigail, on a technical basis, it's just then room to the upside potentially. It will be. Well, I think next week what we're also looking at is J Powell and then the week after CPI, I think it's a week after, maybe it's two weeks after that CPI and the FOMC decision. I think that if, you know, the interesting thing about it is usually with these fed presidents in particular or chairmen's of the federal reserve, they generally when they speak, they don't say anything that is going to diverge or be a talking point ahead of the next meeting. But J Powell is kind of the exception. Like he had a couple of speeches, has dropped hints, you know, earlier this year, I remember that there, I can't remember the exact moment around it, but he could potentially say something next week, like batten down the hatch is more, we are hiking. If that happens, that could be reason to think that stocks come right down off of resistance. Well, that's really interesting, Abigail, because what we've heard in recent weeks has been the tamping down of expectations in terms of a 75 basis point rate hike. And indeed, what's priced in is now 50%, a 50 basis point, excuse me, rate hike. I just don't know where the market, why market watchers are bringing in expectations so much. I think that there could be a cruel awakening to some degree. I mean, I have not heard any fed officials. I mean, every now and then they try to talk it back, but this fed is clearly hawkish. They clearly are on the path of raising rates. And yet markets want them to come down. Plus, there's actually QT, and if you look at the balance sheet, it's actually coming in, it's actually rounding down. They are doing what they said they're gonna do. This is the first time we haven't had these training reels on for more than a decade. So it's always puzzling to me that these pivots, and you know, that July meeting in particular, the quote unquote pivot, I came back, I was out for a few days, and I was like, I listened to it, and I was like, what are they talking about? You know, it just doesn't make sense. I don't know. I don't know. You hear what you want to hear. Yeah, yeah. And you can talk yourselves into it. Guys, thank you so much. Great setup on this Tuesday. Abigail Doolittle, markets reporter at Bloomberg News and our thanks to her as well as Cretigoop to Anchor and Markets Correspondent here at Bloomberg. Let's get to Washington DC now for an update on World and National News. Nancy Lyons is in her 99-1 studio. Hey, Nancy Lyons. Thanks, Tim. Americans are being urged to update their COVID and flu shots before winter arrives. Dr. Anthony Fauci. In what will likely be his final news conference, but for retiring next month says the new by-valent vaccine provides a superior protection. My message and my final message, maybe the final message I give you from this podium is that please, for your own safety, for that of your family, get your updated COVID-19 shot. Fauci spent 50 years in public service. Talks today between US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and his Chinese counterpart being described as productive, Bloomberg political news director Jody Schneider says the fact that talks even took place is progress. Expectations have been lowered. No one expects major deals to come from this. But everyone is hopeful that talking to each other, of course, is a for good first step. Bloomberg's political news director Jody Schneider. The US continues to review its relationship with Saudi Arabia. Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman cannot be sued in the US over the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, because as head of government, he's immune. Still, Secretary of State Antony Blinken says despite that decision, the US is still assessing its relationship with the kingdom. Blinken says the opinion does not speak to the merits of the case, nor the status of the relationship. He says there are no plans for the Saudi crown prince to visit Washington. In Washington, I'm anymore as Bloomberg radio. Saudi Arabia is reveling in today's victory over Argentina at the World Cup, a score of two to one. Mexico and Poland ended in a scoreless draw so to Denmark and Tunisia. Global news, 24 hours a day on air and on Bloomberg, quick take, powered by more than 2,700 journalists and analysts in more than 120 countries on Nancy Lyons. All right, Nancy. Thank you so much. Carol Maser, a long-term stand-of-ic live in our Bloomberg Interactive Broker Studio on this Tuesday. I have to say, and we've got a great cast later on. So we hope you'll stick around to listen or watch. She'll be on radio TV, YouTube, quick take. Who is it, Carol? Kathy Wood of ARK Invest. And really want to pick her brain about FTX and just the crypto fallout because she has been buying whether it's Coinbase, whether it's GBT-C. GBT-C.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1933,2022-11-22 19:13:17
19320," has been buying whether it's Coinbase, whether it's GBTC. She is still just bullish on this space. Absolutely. So curious to see how she sees the opportunistic plays in this environment. Having said that, there have been a lot of headlines in the crypto space, specifically FTX today. Yeah, let's start along with what happened today at today's bankruptcy hearing for the firm. We talked about it on yesterday's program and indeed it ended up happening. Here's some of what we learned. A quote, substantial amount of FTX groups assets, quote, have either been stolen or missing an attorney representing the firm told a bankruptcy court Tuesday in the company's first court appearance since its rapid descent into insolvency. Yeah, this is really interesting. I mean, we know the fall of SBF, his crypto empire happening very quickly was quite shocking. This again was courting to James Bradley. He's co-head of the restructuring practice at the law firm, Sullivan and Cromwell. He was talking to that judge in Wilmington, Delaware. He called chapter 11, this specific chapter 11 bankruptcy case unprecedented. And we keep saying, is this a Lehman moment? How do we think about this in the history of crypto? And that is something that I want to see what Kathy has to say about the 10-year of crypto and where it goes from here. Right. I mean, so far, Carol, it's been limited to crypto. And as Joe Wyzenfall wrote about earlier today, it's something that people don't necessarily need as opposed to the housing crisis, right? You need a house. You need somewhere to live. Right. People who argue don't need crypto. But you do wonder about how much of contagion within the crypto space, which then begs the question, like, how much of this is interconnected and, you know, every day we're putting more and more. And I feel like every time I see somebody show like a chart or of like where the connections are, you realize how much of it is connected. And so it's crypto contagion to some extent, which I feel like we haven't necessarily completely figured out. Anyway, we've got lots more to come, certainly, including a great update with our own Katie Gryffell. That's coming up on Bloomberg Business Week. That has been a success........

19321,"have a lesseet it Yeah is.............................................................. The key takeaways was the record keeping process, which we already knew was pretty. Why are you chocolateing? It was pretty lax. I mean, John J. Wright, the third, who's the new CEO at FTX, of course, was involved in the liquidation of N-Run. I mean, was pretty blunt that it was pretty much non-existent. But that was a consistent theme today, too, that there's really not a lot of records to go by. And when you're trying to sort out more than a million creditors, that's going to be a very long process. And we do, I mean, someone knows who the top 50 creditors are. We don't know who they are because the names were redacted. And that's something that was discussed a lot today, as well. The FTX is set to be back in court, but not until January. So what happens between now and then, Katie? Well, there is supposed to be a second hearing on the issue of the fact that the names were redacted on December 6, 10th. Tim and I were talking about this yesterday with Steven Church. Hopefully you weren't listening, Carol, because you were off. But it's really. You were still working, though. Really unusual that the names would be redacted. In this case, at least two groups of the creditors sent lawyers to this hearing to support the request to keep.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1935,2022-11-22 19:22:12
19322," of the creditors sent lawyers to this hearing to support the request to keep their identity secret for now. One of those groups was representing members who were among the top 50 biggest. So the judge overruled objections from the US trustee who is requesting that we know who these names are for now so they're going to remain secret. I mean this to me then speaks to the contagion impact, right? Like yeah, this is what we're trying to figure out how far this goes, certainly within the crypto universe. It doesn't feel like it's hit certainly the rest of the asset class that is kind of our world on a general basis. But I mean that's what do we know about how much further this goes? Well that's one of the reasons why people want to know who are the top 50 creditors here. I mean who had the most exposure? We know some of you know who might be on that list by their own admission. For example, Gemini, Galaxy, a few other names have come out and talked about their own exposure to FTX. But when you're trying to map where to look for the contagion, right? You would want to see this list. What about the names that are out there that feel like we're going to talk to Kathy. What about this? Which she's been buying coin base. She's been buying grayscale. I think there are questions about you know are these untouched? Yeah or not? It's a great question. Coinbase, Coinbase is an interesting one because Coinbase, I mean it's a US public listed company. It falls under the purview of the SEC from everything that we can see right now. It was untouched by this FTX blow up. But at the same time, I mean the stock has just been obliterated, which is probably why Kathy is looking into it. She likes to buy the discounts. But if you think about the future of the crypto industry, it feels like there's been a lot of love lost for centralized exchanges. Such as Coinbase, you've seen a lot of movement into decentralized exchanges back into decentralized finance into these cold wallets. So if that's the future for crypto, the sort of like de-globalization of the industry, I don't know how Coinbase fits in there. I want to go back to the exposure question, Katie, because why are we hearing now that companies are struggling as a result of the contagion from FTX when a mere two weeks ago they were kind of talking about, oh we'll be fine. I think it had to work its way through the daisy chain. So sorry to interrupt, but does that mean that they weren't directly connected to FTX, but a fall in digital asset prices has led them to have some sort of issue? I mean I'm sure that that's the case. Obviously the lines have gone down as a result, not as much as you might have expected if you're talking about the present Bitcoin. But that is one of the forms that contagion can take. Maybe it's not a direct impact. Maybe you weren't a counterparty to FTX, but you're probably counterparty to someone who was a counterparty. And something that I've been thinking a lot about the crypto industry in the last few days is that so many functions are concentrated in these one companies. It's not unusual for a crypto company to be an exchange broker, a custodian, the list goes on. Those are all separate functions in Trad5. So go to digital currency group, Barry Silverts. So they write um, grayscale Bitcoin to trust is I think they're the largest shareholder in that. Or I think they own about 10% of grayscale. And then you think about they also own the crypto broker Genesis. Yes. Right. Which was affiliated with Alameda. And I guess like what do we know about Silverts in his world and the tentacles and where they go? We, I would love to know more about it, but I'm not putting my fingers at anything's wrong, but I just feel like it's once again that equation akin to what we saw with that. Well, we know that Genesis, which again falls under his empire, uh, is searching for fresh funding right now. Right. We've been used to have a fantastic scoop yesterday that they need fresh funding or bankruptcies in the offing. Barry Silverts also owns grayscale. Like you said, the DCG digital currency group is the largest shareholder in the Bitcoin trust. So even though grayscale from all that we know is fine here, their largest shareholder might come under some pressure of Genesis, which is also in the empire files for bankruptcy. Okay. So what could be the next shoes to drop in 30 seconds? I would watch Genesis. That's what everyone is looking for now. I mean, it's hard to overstate Barry Silverts reach. Yeah. It is interesting. These these singular individuals, right, who we look to kind of as a North Star. And again, I'm not saying anybody.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1936,2022-11-22 19:26:18
19323," a Barry Silver to reach. Yeah, it is interesting. These singular individuals, right, who we look to kind of as a North Star. And again, I'm not saying anybody, I mean, at least Barry Silver, we don't know anything that has gone wrong, but it's just interesting these singular individuals and how wide and vast the reach was in different verticals within the crypto world. Exactly. So, okay. Uh, Crety, Katie, thank you. Sorry, it's just, you know, that kind of thing. I've been called worse.

But it could tell what's going to happen in the US. This is called a deep tease, Terrell. All right, let's get back to the deep thing when it comes to the financial markets. Here is once again, Charlie Pellett. Hi, thank you very much. And here's what's going on. The Dow, the S&P, Nezdaq, all pushing, are holding close to session highs right now, right to the numbers we have got the Dow up by 326 points. That is an advance of 1%. S&P up 38, are now by 1%.

Investors are recalibrating their expectations in response to federal officials, indicating they will continue to raise rates but are open to slowing their tempo. Also, a batch of upbeat earnings also lifting sentiment. The OECD's forecasting global economic growth will slow to 2.2% next year. That is down from 3.1% what about the outlook for the U.S. in the new year. Dana Peterson is chief economist at the conference board. She was interviewed this morning on Bloomberg Television and radio. Well, we think that the economy is probably going to be flat next year and that incorporates a couple of quarters of recession. Maybe the fourth quarter of this year is a little bit negative but really most of the brunt we think will be in the first quarter of next year minus 1.5%, and then second quarter minus 4.10. And then kind of a moderate increase in the back half of next year. So all folding up into pretty much again flat growth for the economy.

I'm Charlie Peloton, that is a Bloomberg business flash. All right Charlie, thank you so much. Well, today's Bloomberg big take, it is about the housing markets around the globe that are wobbling under the weight of central bank rate hikes and how what happens in Canada, maybe a harbinger for the rest of the world. We've got Kevin Orland with us, Canadian finance reporter for Bloomberg News. He joins us via Zoom from our Toronto Bureau. Kevin, I don't know about you, but every time I've traveled in Canada over the last few years, one thing has been certain, a lot of cranes, a lot of cranes building homes in places like Vancouver that I visited. He goes throughout the country and the focus on Toronto and what actually is happening with the real estate market there. That's right, well in addition to the cranes, if you spend any time in Canada, you're going to see real estate agent ads on the side of every bus at every bus stop. That's a lot. Real estate in Canada just really, it took over the economy in a way it hasn't in a lot of other countries around the world. You know, part of this goes back to the 2008 financial crisis, you know, where the US housing crisis is corrected, Canada didn't really have that. It wasn't even a speed bump here. So housing crisis in Canada have been going up for essentially 25 years straight uninterrupted. You know, if you look at the hard statistics, it's the larger share, real estate is the larger share of the economy in Canada out of any G7 country. And you know, even the number of real estate agents has grown to 45% in the last decade. So it's become a huge part of the Canadian economy. And that's kind of why it might be sort of a canary in the coal mine for this housing correction that we're seeing around the world. You could show what it is like you mentioned in the lead in there. Is it going to be a crash or a correction? And you know, some of the economics we talked to this, Canada, at least regarding housing and how that's going to be affected by these interest rate increases, it is really sort of the trailblazer here, but not necessarily in a good way. Well, and you know, not every market is apples to apples when it comes to housing. Are there differences though that would maybe say Canada is either in a better or worse off situation than let's say the United States? Yeah, there's definitely some differences. So on the downside, market is in Canada. You can't lock your rate in for 30 years like you can in the US. So those reprives every three to five years. You know, for subprime borrowers, typically they can only have a mortgage rate locked in for about a year or so. So you know, we're going to see a lot of those rates resetting, you know, March was when we just started raising rates here in Canada. So that will be, you know, we're coming up pretty soon on a full year of rate increases in the system. And I'm really interested to see how many forced sales does that account for? How many people have to sell their houses because their mortgage prices have gone up too much and they can't afford it anymore. But on the sort of protecting that downside, setting a floor under prices, Canada, a nation of 34 million people is, you know, opened its doors to about 500,000 immigrants a year. That's, you know, very large percent of the population, almost 2% of the population every year coming in immigration. So there's a lot more demand for housing and also there's a lot of the constraints on supply here. They just can't build homes fast enough to meet that demand. So, you know, there's a lot of folks that are saying that that will set an ultimately set a floor under it. But until then, you know, it would be interesting to see how far down do prices go, how long do they stay down? A lot of that's going to depend on how long rates stay high, how many people can hang on. A lot of questions there. So it's not a direct comparable market to a place like the US, but certainly other markets like Australia or UK, it's more comparable. Well, that's what I want to try to understand here because it's you and your colleagues right. And we've talked about this on the program this year. It's not just the US and Canada. It's Sweden. It's Australia where we're seeing price declines in the developed world when it comes to real estate. What makes the Canadian market different, apart from the way you describe the mortgages, what makes the Canadian market unique? Well, I mean, one of the factors that has driven that, the increase that we've seen here is that immigration and also the nature of that immigration in Canada is a little bit different too. A lot of the folks who come here, most of them are typically well educated. They're coming with some money. They're coming to take professional positions. And this is really a sort of a call.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1939,2022-11-22 19:39:34
19326, a lot of the folks who come here most of them are typically you know well educated they're coming with some money they're coming to take uh... you know professional positions and this is really a sort of a core part of the Canadian economic strategy is to import uh... into poor people into the country uh... they you know they recognize that the population isn't going to uh... grow at the same rate here on its own so it's really a non-controversial left-right core plank of the Canadian economic philosophy here so that's uh... that's one factor that's uh... it's going to drive it um... i think that's uh... that's a kind of a thing to go right now in in terms of uh... what's causing that uh... that increase in demand alright we're leaving on that note he kevin uh... great story uh...

regulator is investigating for potential securities law violations tied to their promotions of crypto exchange f t x okay here's the thing carol what do you think if you are tom Brady or stuff curry right before you get involved in pitching something you've got a team of lawyers that are coming through it to make sure you don't get stuck in a sticky situation right i don't say something that's right i would hope right i'm saying this with a question right right i would uh... yeah i mean the regulator is scrutinizing payments received by the celebrities to endorse f t x u s along with what disclosures were made and how accessible they were,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1940,2022-11-22 19:43:51
19327," Yeah, I mean the regulator is scrutinizing payments received by the celebrities to endorse FTX US along with what disclosures were made and how accessible they were to retail investors Joe Ratunda, director of enforcement at the Texas State Securities Board telling Bloomberg news in an interview. He said we are taking a close look at them. Though the stores endorsements aren't the most immediate priority, there's still a focus in the regulators larger probe into FTX's collapse. I don't know. When you endorse some of those. If these were athletes on Texas teams, would they still be getting this attention? I don't know, I don't know. But it's just interesting. All right, so you assume a celebrity endorser is getting paid, right? Of course. I think that's a safe assumption. Coming out. Or getting payments and equity of some sort. Right. And I feel like I was looking at a spot that had Jezele and Tom and all these different people. And it, there was an assumption that, yeah, I'm in. Right. Yeah, you win. So, I assume some ownership. And that they're talking it up. So, like- That's what I, that's my point about if you're making a, a pitch like that, you've got to have a team of lawyers that are making sure you're squeaky clean.

Right now we have got Abacrombian Fitch up by 20.5%. Best Buy up 10.6%. American Eagle up by 16.7% exporting goods up now by 8.3%. The S&P up 40, that is a gain of 1% the Dow up 325 now up by 1%.

I'm Charlie Palette and that is a Bloomberg Business Fly. All right, Charlie. Thanks for the update. Well, there's a lot in the spotlight today. Crypto of course, Twitter and Elon. That's a given. And then there is always I feel like in the background as of late the private equity world, which is no doubt about it in the sites of Washington and an array of regulators. I'm happy to say that in this sort of super easy, really, really interesting and easy to believe in. It's a very comprehensive trust reporter for Bloomberg news. She joins us right now from our 99.1 studio in Washington. Check out her story. It's on the Bloomberg Terminal and at Bloomberg.com. Business week. Joel Weber is the editor of Bloomberg Business Week. He's with us right now in the Bloomberg Interactive Brokers studio. Joel Liyah wrote this story with Todd Shields as well. And I've got to tell you, I thought you know, with carried interest being safe after almost dying a few in the crosshairs of Longings? Oh, maybe everything about it. Everything about Friday, exactly. Yeah, exactly. So that's right. I think carried interest has been the thing that people have long associated with the private equity industry. And it has come up many a times and it kind of gets kicked around and then kicked down. And what's interesting now is about the Biden administration and regulators throughout agencies that are starting to kind of like pinch these places that private equity doesn't like to get pinched. And that has, it's not like a direct thing. Biden isn't quoted saying that he's coming for the industry. But it's sort, but if you read between the lines, there's clearly something happening here. So, so Leah, tell us more. Yeah, so there are quite a few regulators here in Washington who sort of set their sights on private equity. The SEC has proposed new rules about disclosure and the antitrust regulators that suggest this department and the federal trade commission have both made some noise about how they have concerns here. The Justice Department opens a surprise probe a month or so ago into what are called interlocking director it's that's where a company or a person sits on the board of two competitors. And after they announced this probe, Tom Abrava directors stepped down from two different public companies. They've also sent out notes to a couple other major private equity folks like Apollo and Blackstone raising some concerns about some of their holdings. And then the sort of center piece of our story was about this deal between standard general, which is a head of the state.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1942,2022-11-22 19:52:57
19329," raising some concerns about some of their holdings. And then the sort of center piece of our story was about this deal between Standard General, which is a hedge fund and a Tecna, which is the broadcast stations that were spun out of Gennat. But the sort of interesting piece about the steel is that it's backed by Apollo. And so that aspect has sort of put it under the microscope with both telecom regulators and the Justice Department who need to clear the deal before it can go through. So Leah, talk a little bit about the idea of transparency here because this is an industry that, you know, inherently is private, right? Well, I was going to say they don't call it private equity. Exactly. So I'm wondering what you're hearing from the industry because you quote some folks who represent the industry about what they think about this. And look, there's politics here too and you think of prominent donors as well. Yeah, they're not that happy about this. I'll put it that way. You know, they think that they're doing good. They're investing in lots of companies. None of these, as Jill said, none of these are sort of direct attacks. You're not hearing Joe Biden say anything about private equity. But these are sort of his people within the administration giving them a little bit of a poke at some of the things that they've done for a long period of time. I mean, sitting on the boards of various companies is something that has gone on for quite a while. But the Justice Department noted, you know, this law has existed since 1914 just because you guys have done it for the past couple decades. Doesn't necessarily mean it's legal. Leah, what's the truth about private equity? Or is it a little bit of everything, meaning that they sometimes come in, provide the funding when others don't want to touch something. Sometimes it's distressed assets or what have you. The other flip side is, you know, a lot of cost cutting, a quick way of like within a what or two or three year. A little bit of debt added to the company. A little bit of debt. And spit it out and make some money. So what's the truth when it comes to private equity? I mean, that's a little bit of a complicated question. I'll just say that the ones that the regulators are concerned about, they say, you know, there's not one size fits all here. There are some good things that private equity can do. But the ones that really raise their concerns or sort of what we might call a strip and flip, you know, where you come in, you load it down with dad and then you sell it off. And it's not going to do as well. The other ones that they're really concerned with are roll ups, right? So you might buy one company and then you start adding on more and more and more companies. And some of these are small. So it might not have come to the attention of regulators that they're sort of amassing this dominant player in a market. Okay, so what are some of the latest fallies? Because in talk us through the agencies that are kind of nipping here with which ones are you guys watching in DC? Yeah, so I primarily focus a lot on the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission. The Justice Department is the one that's doing this probe into interlocking directorates as they're called. And also it's looking at the standard general Tegna merger. The FTC is a consumer protection and antitrust regulator. It has raised a little bit of concerns about private equity in the health care space. You know, there have been some articles in the press about how maybe when private equity invests in health care that the health outcomes aren't as good. This is looking particularly at things like nursing homes on the FTC actually had a settlement earlier this year with JAB over in the past. Over it rolling up a bunch of emergency veterinary clinics. They were concerned that they had sort of bought three different emergency vet clinics rolled them up into one. And maybe that was increasing prices when you know your dog accidentally swallows your shoe or something. So, you know, these are the sort of things. Yeah, you're speaking from experience, Phil. Hey, Alia, before we let you go, I'm curious how this is rippling into fundraising. And it's probably difficult to make a connection at this point because this stuff kind of takes years to work through a system. But when you talk to your sources about going out and raising money from LPs, what are GPs telling you about whether or not it's more difficult because of potential regulatory scrutiny? I mean, that's definitely something that you have to pay attention to now. You know, this is sort of thing that has to be thought about when you're doing a deal, whether the review might be extended in the standard general tag net case. They had hoped that this deal would get review within nine months and they had added this provision.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1943,2022-11-22 19:56:49
19330," The review might be extended in the standard general tag net case. They had hoped that this deal would get review within nine months and they had added this provision called ticking fees. So the longer the review takes, the more money they're actually going to have to pay to tag net shareholders. So they're not that happy about the fact that regulators are lengthening the deal since it means that they're going to have to pay more. I'm really curious. What's going to be the next turn of the screw that is going to make private equity call their local lobbyist? Well, I mean, the Justice Department is continuing to investigate the interlocking directorates issue and also just whether having private equity owners is changing the incentives of some companies. We're expecting maybe a big private equity deal block maybe in the next year where they'll sort of make this point either at the DOJ or the FTSC. All right, certainly a relevant story and something that we've been talking about a lot here. I feel like on business week on a regular basis. Leah, thank you so much.

And Scarlett, you made the great point yesterday as far as COVID numbers. It's just what we hear from China. It's what they're reporting. But they did record 27,300 cases for Monday. That's just shy of the previous record of 28,900 reached back in April. We currently have 48 cities in China subject to some form of district level or widespread movement restrictions. According to Nomura, that affects nearly one fifth of China's economic output. Yeah, well, I want to stick with EM and EM assets for a moment here because we're also seeing EWZ, which is the ETF that tracks Brazilian stocks falling after a gyro post-zenaro's party is now questioning the election results. So we'll be keeping an eye on that, especially as the rail sinks to session lows. Yeah, of course. So one of the most important economies in the world with a lot of political instability right now. We go back to the U.S. markets here and we've been talking a lot here about just how wild the volatility has been all year long with an S&P 500 that has had gains or losses of more than 1%. Dozens of times this year. But over the last seven sessions, not much. Here on day eight, it looks like they could break that up about 1% here on the day, but still stuck below 4,000. The Dow Jones industrial average also up by about a percent. And that's that composite also getting in the mix with similar size gains on the day. Well, typically Thanksgiving week is kind of bullish. Piper Sandler has crunched numbers and found that there's a dip on Monday and then 68% of the time improves around Thursday in data going back to 1950. So it's kind of playing out right now. We have energy stocks as the best performers up by 3% and last I checked all the members in that group are higher. This follows two days of being the market's worst performers over the last couple of hours. Materials doing well as tech as well. Consumer discretionary remain is right in the middle there. And of course, we're seeing some of the best performers are retailers and some of the worst performers are retailers best by being on the upside, Dollar Tree on the downside. All right. Well, let's look at some of those retailers right now. We talk about the moves that we're seeing in Best Buy. They did raise their profit forecast. A similar story that we're seeing right now for Abercrombie and Fitch and both of those names getting a pretty big boost in the shares 19% on Abercrombie 11% here on Best Buy. We should point out though, Comp Sales, at least on an annual basis, still going to be negative for both of those names. Now, the better sort of, I guess a picture you're going to find in Burlington stores, they came out with earnings and they were phenomenal actually. They really beat here and this sort of reiterates and I guess reinforces the idea of a trade down by some consumers here into some of that discount space. So shares up by about 21%. However, that's not actually helping out Dollar Tree shares down about 8% though we should point out Dollar Tree has a lot bigger issues rather than just the macro. Of course, still trying to integrate and best position of that family dollar brand within the umbrella of that company there. When we talk about leadership in this market, we always look to the Apple's, Microsoft's and videos of the world they are helping to do some of the heavy lifting to on this day. Take a look at this next chart here because I was taking a look at what the Equal Weight S&B 500 was doing right now and it's outperforming now.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1945,2022-11-22 20:05:32
19332," helping to do some of the heavy lifting on this day. But take a look at this next chart here, because I was taking a look at what the Equal Weight S&P 500 was doing right now. And it's outperforming, not only in this day, not only on this week, but in fact, the majority of weeks this year that S&P 500 Equal Weight Index, which of course trips out the bias of the large microcaps companies. That's actually outperformed here. I think about 30 times, 30 weeks out of the 47 weeks that we've had this year. You compare that to the last couple of years where it only outperform fewer than half of the weeks during the year. Yeah, that's interesting outperformance there that you're talking about. And you do wonder where their companies are saying, wait, we're going to start to see the Fed stop in terms of its aggressive rate hikes. But I got to say, the Fed drumbeat continues. And today we heard from a Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland President, LaReta Master. She, again, coming out, those saying that she and her colleagues, it's all about those economic price pressures and reigning them in. She spoke at a virtual event that her bank hosted. Check it out. Given the high level of inflation, restoring priceability remains the number one focus of the FOMC. And we're committed to using our tools to put inflation on a sustainable downward trajectory to 2%. And of course, that's LaReta Master. She's president of the Cleveland Fed. And so listen, this is why, you know, if we start to see inflation pressures continue to come down significantly, that's when we can maybe really have a productive conversation to him about the Fed changing its policies in a significant way to really pivoting, if you will. I'm kind of chuckling a little bit, is seeing her say that. Because if you would have showed me that video six months ago, it would have made perfect sense as well. The tone hasn't shifted by any means. Some Fed officials are seeming like they're less hawkish. But at the same time, we're hearing the same thing over and over again. Price stability is the absolute focus of this Fed. But what's changed, of course, is 2,30s ago, we had that blockbuster inflation report, which showed that perhaps things are slowing down. And the Fed can consider at least pausing or even slowing down the rate hikes. I keep hearing this term hawkish slowing, which is used to describe potentially the Fed's next move of a 50 basis point rate increase, as opposed to a 75 basis point rate increase. And that kind of sets a precedent for slowing down that trajectory. Well, all right. And by that still a rate increase, and we're still talking about a Fed officials making it clear that they plan to sort of stay somewhere at some degree of a plateau, whether it's that going to be that 5% a terminal rate or not. But the idea that we're going to ever going to see what we saw over the last few years with near zero rates doesn't appear to be on the cards. And what really matters is the end game, right? So if they do less aggressive rate increases, but continue for a longer duration, right, we're still going to get to the same place. It's just a little bit of a different journey. And so it's interesting, the market enthusiasm that we see Tim today. I mean, here we are taking another leg up on the equity trade. We've got to do some of that has to do with a weaker dollar. And what that means in terms of overseas profits for multinational. Are you saying that? The beatings will continue, Carol, until morale and peruse. It just means that maybe the beatings are a little less severe. That's it. It's like foot flopping for day to day. All right, guys, we get around. We're going to be back, though, in less than an hour's time, our cross-platform coverage radio, TV, YouTube, and Bloomberg Quicktake will all get in down to the close on this Tuesday. You're listening to Bloomberg Business Week with Carol Maser, and Bloomberg Quicktake's Tim Stenevig on Bloomberg Radio. And then we are taking another leg up here. We are at our best levels of the session. So up about 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 and the NASDAQ. I was going to bring in Carol, this note that we got from Goldman Sachs a little earlier. We have some time to talk about it. But our own list, Capel McCormick, writing about this, that Goldman now sees a 10-year treasury yield of 4% or more through 2024. So essentially saying that rates are going to be high, not just through next year, but also through the following year. Yeah, your 10 years below 4% right now, 376. But the point is that the Fed is going to keep raising rates as, you know, Romaine was pointing out. Maybe it's not as aggressive, but we continue. And, you know, we're going to continue seeing rate increases. And then the Fed's going to stop. And so when it starts to reduce rates, I think that's certainly fair to say it's up in the air. Yeah. Well, according to Goldman, it's not going to be for a while. Here's an interesting stat. What's a while? Are they saying, well, if through 2024, so above 4%, and what that means is, well, high mortgage rates, because the 10 years closely tied to 30-year mortgages are closely tied to.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1946,2022-11-22 20:10:05
19333, I love they saying well if through 2024 so above 4% and what that means is well high mortgage rates because the 10 years closely tied to 30 year mortgages are closely tied to the 10 year there's this there's this interesting stat carol the 10 year which is right about 3.76% as you mentioned it's traded at 4% are higher for 23 days so far in 2022 all of those have occurred since late September but before that the yield hadn't touched that level since early 2010 right so the think about rates and where they go longer term and where they stay and where they get sticky has risen right the expectations we're not talking shorter and we know the shorter and everybody expects it to be higher but that's important about where you think they will go and what the bets that are being made within the market 10 years out right so what does that do the housing market I don't know I mean it's definitely going to slow down but you know I was listening to Surreillance this morning and I can't remember there was Barry Redholtz or somebody else making the point millennials are buying homes like they're having kids they're friend of mine just bought a house yesterday so ultimately I said with these interest rates you need it to live you know what I mean and you're gonna make decisions based on what you need to live by so anyway got to kind of think about that a little bit let's get to world a national news Nancy Lions is in our 99 one studio hey Nance thanks Tim well after a three-year battle the House Ways and Means Committee will be receiving former president Trump's tax returns the Supreme Court cleared the way for that to happen today issuing an order that came without any explanation or public dissents the pressure is on for a rail strike to be averted before the holidays the largest railway labor union is rejected a deal that was brokered back in September even though other unions have signed on industry Groves urging Congress to step in policy analyst Isaac well Tonsky of the financial firm BTIG explained what it can do in a Bloomberg interview there's a law called the railway labor act and that let's Congress come in to either impose a resolution based on what the president's emergency board submitted this past summer or to check the can down the road to require operations for say three or six months well Tonsky said the Democratic lame duck Congress might choose to act rather than buck the issue to the next Republican House which might be less friendly to organized labor in Washington or champs and boomer gradia a spike in COVID-19 cases in China is raising concerns about the supply chain Bloomberg's end of current is in Hong Kong I think there is a feeling now among China watchers that China's heading into a very difficult few weeks it's going to be probably the biggest test of COVID-zero since the pandemic begun again Bloomberg's end of current at the World Cup Saudi Arabia provided the first real stunner in the competition beating Argentina 2 to 1 Mexico and Poland played to a scoreless draw so did Denmark and Tunisia France that offending World Cup champs has a 2 to 1 lead over Australia global news 24 hours a day on air and on Bloomberg quick take on Nancy Lions all right Nancy thank you so much Carol master Tim Stenevek live in her Bloomberg interactive broker studio streaming on YouTube as well as on Bloomberg quick take we do want to remind everybody we are going to be talking with Kathy would in just about 40 minutes time so a lot to get to with her when it comes to crypto and Tesla and Twitter in the meantime though a name that's certainly been on our radar for a while is Carvana yeah the used car dealer the online use car dealer the share price hasn't winded at a fever fever pitch to 97% 97% and it still could go with you know obviously it can keep moving lower yeah the company shares spiraling down 97% analyst average price target struggle to keep pace despite coming down sharply Carol yeah I always love watching when something either takes off on Wall Street or falls you know comes and done and how the Wall Street and the analyst community how they think about their ratings and their rankings and what this does is with the company shares spiraling down a staggering as we said 97% this year Alice average price target struggle to keep pace despite coming down sharply that change this month and in just the past week alone at least three analysts downgrade the stocks slash their targets saying the combination of weakening economic conditions and the car dealers heavy debt load could lead to more dire outcomes Carol this is a company that last year had a market cap that exceeded 60 billion dollars fast forward to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1947,2022-11-22 20:14:04
19334," Carol, this is a company that last year had a market cap that exceeded $60 billion. Fast forward to close to the end of 2022, we're hovering around $1.23 billion. Can I just tell you there's still nine buys, 16 holds and three cells, according to Bloomberg data. Okay, so it's kind of a double whammy here. What? That's hitting Carvana. One is that used car prices have come down, so that hits the company, demand for them have come down. And then there's also in the higher interest rate environment that we're in now. Consumers are less likely to go out and make a big purchase, like an automobile. Right, there's a couple things hitting it. Right now, if I look at the Bloomberg data, 12 month price target, I guess that's the average one, is like $19.83 stock right now at $6.77. Okay, so that's like a more than a doubling, right? So they're optimistic. Yeah, that's the takeaway, Dave. All right, you're listening and watching Bloomberg Business Week. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

She's consumer reporter for Bloomberg news. She covers beyond meat and other faux meat companies for Bloomberg news She wanted to get her on the program because she had a deep dive. Yes. Yes. Yesterday morning into A dirty conditions at a key plant. It's a facility in Pennsylvania and Illustrates the alt meat makers ongoing difficulties. Dina Shanker joins us now via zoom from New York City Dina according to these reports what was found at that plant in Pennsylvania Hi, thank you guys so much for having me on and basically what we saw from photos and internal documents was Plant that was just not operating safely or following basic Health and safety measures. We saw a lot of mold both on ingredient containers and on the wall. I mean these pictures Dina are pretty shocking that are included in the piece Yeah, I mean They are they are because I don't think that any of us Want to see a food plant that looks like this You know there's things in these pictures that many of us may not even notice is bad practice, but For example, we have a picture that shows a trolley car turned over into a large funnel type of shape of machine and we don't We can look at that we can say that that doesn't look right to me We can't necessarily say why or exactly what's wrong with it But the experts actually not only pointed out that which they said is dangerous for the people involved They said it's contaminated or there's room for contamination because you never want something with wheels on the floor to be That close to your food production services, but if you look at that picture me Yeah, right But if you look at that picture you'll also see to the left There's a bucket on a machine and that was actually point We don't even mention this in the story, but the experts also noticed that bucket It's cut off in the photo and they said that bucket shouldn't be on a machine and there's a hammer on a machine Those things shouldn't be on a machine and that's what I'm saying",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1949,2022-11-22 20:22:59
19336," mention this in the story, but the experts also noticed that bucket. Um, it's cut off in the photo and they said, that bucket shouldn't be on a machine. And there's a hammer on a machine. They said, those things shouldn't be on those machines. It's just, it's just, it's supposed to be messy. And we got it. Just for everybody who's watching on YouTube, where we're quick take, you can actually see what Dina is talking about. Dina, I got to say mold, right? Like, I'm not with it. My basement, like it starts to freak it out and you freak it out and you just take care of it because it can be dangerous. But mold growth takes a while. Right? So it's not like, oops, we just missed it. It just happened. This stuff takes a while to develop. That's right. And we see the mold on ingredients containers, but we also see it on the wall. Um, or on one photo on a wall. And it, uh, that's exactly right. It doesn't mean that this one day at this one moment in time, somebody happened to capture a bad, uh, situation. It means that that situation has been like that for a little while in order for that to happen. Dina, where did these photos come from? From a former employee who worked in the plant and was really concerned about the conditions in it. And what did Beyond Meet tell you in response to inquiries related to these photos and what it showed at, allegedly happening at the plant? Um, they said that the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture found no instances of non-conformance with regulation during their inspection. They said that they go above and beyond industry and regulatory standards with their food. They see protocol, they mentioned audits, which give them, um, very high ratings. They did not comment specifically on the documents or the conditions we described today from the photo. One thing that emerged to me in, in terms of reading your piece was sort of this pattern of, I don't, I don't want to ascribe intent to this, but I was pretty surprised to see that basic paperwork and fees hadn't been paid to the state, like a $30 fee, I recall. Yeah. Yeah. The $35 registration fee. That's right. What does that illustrate to you? Um, that they're, they're not following basic good practices. But, uh, to me, I wonder who's in charge and where are they? And, um, why is this such a pervasive problem in this plant? I mean, I have a lot more photos that we didn't include. So it goes way beyond, um, and, you know, four, four photographs. I don't know if you could point out for anybody who's listening at this point, internal reports also show that some contaminated products made it through to consumers. So ultimately did a lot get out to consumers. What do we know? And I am curious when it comes to beyond meat facilities, this Pennsylvania one, how important is it in terms of overall production? So, um, I'll, in order, uh, in terms of what reached consumers, what we know is that, um, from the documents that were shared, that, uh, some wood in two, uh, separate A&W burgers at two different restaurants was found by consumers, um, and, uh, that, uh, a metal link was found in a bag of Duncan sausage patties. And, and there's also, there was recently, uh, recall from, uh, Costco in Canada because of wood found in the product. Um, that's what we have documents of from, from reporting this story. Um, in terms of the role this plant plays in the company, it's actually a very important one because the company doesn't have a lot of its own real estate in the U.S. They have, um, two sister sites in Columbia, Missouri, and this plant. And the plan had been, um, for this plant to, uh, be upgraded and, uh, expanded. Um, the company had been planning on, uh, doubling the size of this plant, um, as recently as this summer, there were expectations that that would happen. So this was certainly an important, I mean, this is an important location for this company. Most of its manufacturing in the U.S. is done by co-manufacturers. They make their, their raw material, um, sort of like their secret sauce, uh, ingredients at their Columbia facilities.

19338," Bloomberg Business app and Bloomberg Radio.com. This is Bloomberg Business Week. All right everybody, checking out shares of Tesla. They're just up about 1% in today's session. Something we might get into with Kathy Wood. I hope we have enough time to do it all. But certainly she has been an advocate for a long time with this company, see what she has to say. We're getting a good chunk of time with her in the four o'clock hour, so looking forward to that. All right, in the meantime, we're going to talk with our Tesla and China in their policy. But in the meantime, let's get another check on our trading day with Shirley Pell. Thank you very much, Carol Messer and Tim. Also, we have got stocks holding at session highs right now. 20 minutes to go ahead of the close, right to the numbers with the S&P now up by 49 points. That's a gain of 1.3%. Dow industrials up 384 higher by 1.1%. As stack is up 130 points right now, that's a gain of 1.2%. 10 year yield, 3.75%. The two year, 4.51%. Spot gold up $1.00. The ounce now still a little changed up less than 1.10% to 1.1739. And West Texas, Inimedia Crude up 1.3%. 81.11 for a barrel of WTI. Cannot ignore Bitcoin up 3.3% right now at 16,150. Investors today recalibrating their expectations in response to federal officials indicating that they will continue to raise rates but are open to slowing their tempo. Nadia level is senior strategist at UBS Financial Services. And on Bloomberg Television and Radio this morning, she told us consumers are holding up. We're seeing the defendant in retail earn in this week and also in terms of retail sales. But, you know, the consumer spending is shifting. It continues to shift away from goods and towards services. I think what's given consumer confidence in spread to spend is the labor market. You know, the unemployment rate still remains pretty lower, 3.7%. We're seeing, you know, more to layoffs and tack. And if that becomes more widespread, then we think that this consumer will be more concerned about job security and probably tighten their bell as we get into 2023. And a lot of double-digit moves after earnings, Case in Point, Abercrombie and Fitch, up now by 20.8%, Best Buy up by 12.2% American Eagle Outfitters, 16.9% exporting goods up by 10%. So we've got a big game today for a lot of the retail names. After the bell, we'll be hearing from VMware, AutoDisc HP Inc. Nordstrom. We will be all over those numbers as they break. So again, recapping here, S&P up 50, up 1.3%. And that is a Bloomberg Business Flash. All right, Charlie. Thank you so much. Carol Maserton, Stenevich Live in our Bloomberg Interactive Broker Studio here at Bloomberg headquarters. Tesla shares, by the way, hitting a 52-wheel load today, they're down to more than 50% year to date. Yeah, it's not just a one-year load, they're at multi-year lows.

19339," So today they're down to more than 50% year to date. Yeah, it's not just a one year low, they're at multi year lows. For this, we turned to Ed Lodlow. He's West Coast correspondent for Bloomberg News. He joins us from our Bloomberg 960 Studio in San Francisco. For another edition of Plugged In, it's Bloomberg Plugged In. You're weekly look at EVs. It's brought to you by Audi. Don't let someone else drive off in the Audi model. You've always wanted. Visit your local tri-state Audi dealer. But get behind the wheel of yours today. Or visit AudiOffers.com for more information. Ed, good to have you with us this afternoon. When I think of Tesla, I really am just thinking about this connection to Elon Musk and Twitter. Because if you go back to October 28th late October, when we saw the deal for Twitter close, Tesla shares have lost more than a quarter of their value since then. Is the concerns that investors are just worried that his attention is elsewhere? Yes, and no. I mean, the concerns are wider now in the sense. There is some key man risk that Musk might be too distracted for he is seeing too much on Twitter and not enough time on to Tesla. There is frustration out there that that's the case. But Tesla is a big global company. There's a lot of concern about COVID-0, both in terms of how that's hampering demand. And there's evidence right from our stories on the Bloomberg terminal that Tesla recognizes that impact to demand, particularly in China. But also what any lockdowns that may happen or may not happen is the case maybe mean for the Shanghai plant, which is just so critical to Tesla's footprint. How important is China to the Tesla story longer termed? Incredibly important, because China is the world's biggest automotive market, biggest EV market. The difference there is, you know, the three of us kind of sit here every week and we're like, what's the latest EV right from GM and Ford? Because we're here in North America in China, different bull game. There are so many more players, right? Domestic players who offer a wider range of models. And Tesla has done very well there historically. But now, while demand is kind of slipping in that nation due to the macro picture, consumers have more choice. And now what we see is Tesla recognizing, wow, we've got to do something to kind of respond to that, you know, be a mainstay in that Chinese market. So Ed, we're interviewing Kathy Wood a little bit later in the program. Yeah, and she's a long held, you know, bowl on Tesla. But she's also been buying shares of GM, which is interesting. What's the innovation story at GM right now? Yeah, I mean, I've discussed this point with her that, you know, it's not winner takes all in the EV market. The global market for cars is way too big. Tesla's never going to conquer it 100%. They might be the market incumbent now, but penetration of EVs in North America, for example, is around 5%. There's a lot of room for people to go there. And, you know, GM is talking a big game, their commitment to investing in electric figure is in the tens of billions of dollars, right? They are bullish about their technology, the Altium battery platform, which they think is going to be profitable by 2025 as we scooped Mary Barrow on the other day. So, you know, I think you asked her, but I think Kathy Wood recognizes that there were room for other players in the future, and GM is a good candidate. I don't know how, you know, it's been an interesting couple of weeks when it comes to Elon Musk and Tesla and Twitter, right? The trifecta. But how do you, you know, what is it that we need to think about that maybe some of the things, I know that there was some writing about what Elon did at Tesla specifically, he's doing with Twitter kind of, you gotta be committed, you know, knows the right answer. I think hardcore, extremely hardcore is the term here. Like how do you think about it? Like this is just Elon being Elon, folks, so don't you remember what he did at Tesla kind of thing? I think, you know, a lot of people were worried that Elon is not paying attention at Tesla. You know, there's two sides of this story. There's the Twitter side and the Tesla side at Twitter. You know, he's going to his playbook. Tesla and SpaceX, which we also lead to Sierra, right, went through incredible periods of duress before that they were the giants they are now. And Twitter is Elon's latest project trying to fix a company that's under duress. You know, on the Tesla side, those that are saying forget about Elon for a minute, you know, Tesla, there are other people there. It's a ginormous company, but there are key figures like CFOs at Kirk Horn, Drew Baglino, who's the SVP for powertrain. A lot of experienced, you know, senior people who...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1953,2022-11-22 20:40:13
19340," It's a ginormous company, but there are key figures like CFOs at Kirk Horn, Drew Baglino, who's the SVP for powertrain. A lot of experienced senior people who basically Elon leaves the company to run day to day too. He still talks about being the kind of chief engineer, getting to grips with the technology himself at Tesla. Right. But he doesn't see himself as like a traditional CEO that's kind of keeping crack in the whip and keeping everyone running day to day. We're bouncing around, got about 15 seconds here. The bottom line, the revamped Chinese marketing strategy, we don't need to be worried about Tesla. They've got this. Tesla is doing marketing and it doesn't do traditional marketing. We're talking TD ads, promotions in that Chinese market. It's kind of feeling the heat. That's what we're seeing. All right. Good stuff and a good check in on a name that we often talk about and with good reason. Ed Lovelow, thank you so much. West Coast correspondent Bloomberg News from our 960 studio in San Francisco. Ed, thank you. Well, let's get to world and national news now for that. We go to our 991 studio in Washington, D.C. where we find Nancy Lines. Thanks, Tim. The U.S. Supreme Court is clearing the way for a House committee to get six years of Donald Trump's tax returns, rejecting a last-itch effort by the former president to block the IRS from turning them over. A high court order which came without explanation or any public dissents lifted a temporary hold that Chief Justice John Roberts had imposed as the justice's weighed Trump's bid for a longer delay. Lawmaker said they needed the returns to consider possible legislation on presidential compliance with tax laws. Well several powerful industry groups are urging Congress to step in and prevent a rail strike ahead of the holiday season. That's if railway unions do not agree to a labor pack. Negotiations are continuing this afternoon. Brad Ellman is a labor attorney with the Brotherhood of Maintenance Away employees. He says workers are seeking a better benefits package. Most railroad workers have no paid sick leave and the experience of the pandemic obviously highlighted that as a major shortcoming of existing collective bargaining agreements. That's labor attorney Brad Ellman, a prolonged rail strike could cause shortages and higher prices for goods. A Massachusetts man has been charged with reckless homicide after crashing his SUV through the front window of an Apple store in Massachusetts yesterday. One person was killed nearly 20 others injured. At the World Cup, Saudi Arabia scored a major upset today, beating Leon O'Messi's Argentina team, two to one, both of Saudi Arabia's goals came in the second half. Mexico and Poland ended at a scoreless draw, so did Denmark and Tunisia, France leads Australia now, four to one. Global news 24 hours a day on air and on Bloomberg Quicktake, powered by more than 2700 journalists and analysts in more than 120 countries. Thank you so much, Nancy Lyons. All right folks, we're thinking about the upcoming holidays and if you're wondering Tim where to shop for a gift. Look no further than New York City's Fifth Avenue and just why? Just bring bags of gold. If you want to spend money, it's a good place to go. Get this Carol, Fifth Avenue here in Manhattan has been named the world's most expensive shopping area. This doesn't surprise me though. No. So much of it is marketing in these stores. I guess so, right? So space and upper Fifth Avenue, so we're talking about between 49th and 60th Street. So we're talking also around by rock center, the Christmas trees over there. Garner some of the highest average rents according to report by Christmas and Wakefield. The areas resilience during the pandemic downturn coupled with the strength of the US dollar helped the quarter bounce to the top of a list of shopping districts across the world from its second level spot in a ranking down before COVID hit. It's also a place where a lot of tourists end up hanging out. Place where tourists hang out and of course these high rents are commanded by landlords who end up having high end shops. In them. And that's what I mean when I say it's about marketing because so many people end up going to this part of the city when they come out visit New York, even if they're not necessarily going to buy something from one of these stores. All right. So in the US, rents for retailers are now 25% above pre-pandemic levels. The average price for a spot on upper Fifth Avenue in New York climbed 14% from before COVID hit. This is according to that report. Okay. So let's talk about other areas of the world. Hong Kong's Simshaw Sway District was the second most expensive spot followed by Milan's Via Montepelilloné. London's new Bond Street and the Avenue des Champs-Elysées in Paris. Yeah. The Asia Pacific region and the Europe, Middle East and Africa area have yet to fully bounce back from the downturn Hong Kong's area that you just mentioned is seeing.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1954,2022-11-22 20:44:33
19341," Lisee in Paris. Yeah, the Asia Pacific region and the Europe, Middle East and Africa area have yet to fully bounce back from the downturn Hong Kong's area that you just mentioned is seeing rents 41% below pre-pantemic levels. It kind of makes sense if you're in an area where, you know, foot traffic isn't back to what it was before the pandemic because of certain restrictions. Certainly, Hong Kong is not like, you know, what we see in mainland China. I also do wonder what the impact is of China really taking back Hong Kong right and having much more say over it. If that has also dampened in terms of tourism and maybe, certainly what it means for retail and shopping in that area. All right, you are listening to Bloomberg Business Week, Carol Mastertom, Stanovick, let's get back to world.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1955,2022-11-22 20:49:08

I'm Charlie Pellegrines and that is a Bloomberg business flash. Thank you so much for that update, Charlie Pellegrines. It's 348 unwall street. The following is an editorial from Bloomberg Opinion. This editorial was written by the Bloomberg Editorial Board. American children face a viral triple threat this year. The combined impact of COVID-19, the flu and RSV, a virus that can be very dangerous for infants and young children, has overwhelmed hospitals. To prevent another blow to the health care system, officials need a better way to anticipate and respond to these threats. The CDC could start by developing a risk threshold based on deaths and hospitals. The CDC could start by developing a risk threshold based on deaths and hospitalizations for all respiratory viruses combined. Crossing a certain threshold would trigger policy responses, such as freeing up beds or sending a surge of medical staff. In the longer term, the Biden administration should develop a national strategy to draw more workers into the health care field. Better data, coupled with a more resilient workforce, should help health systems meet this challenge. This editorial was written by the Bloomberg Editorial Board.

How about you let me drive? Oh, no, no, no, no. Who's going to drive you home? Honey, please, I'll do the drive. Drive-on. Excuse me, I want to drive. It's the question that drives us. This is the question that drives us. This is the question that drives us. This is the drive to the close. That fun to music will drive us jumping on on Bloomberg Radio. All right, just about 10 minutes left in today's trading session. We're seeing some buying once again into the close. I feel like a broken record because I feel like over the last week or so. We've seen that a few times. We're now pretty much at our best levels of this day, Tim. Interestingly enough, I'm the S&P 500 over the last five days, Carol. We're up only two tens of 1%. Yeah, so right. We're going to go to it with Asha Metta, founder and chief investment officer at global Delta Capital, also the author of Power of Capital, an adventure capitalist journey to a sustainable future joining us via Zoom this afternoon. Asha, how are you? Hi, I'm delighted to be with you. It's good to have you with us this afternoon. I just want to start with the markets and then get a little bit into your book because this is some really interesting stuff. How would you describe where we are right now in terms of rate hikes, a tightening cycle, and when we're going to start with the market, we're going to start with the market. This is a tough question to begin with. And I think we just heard in some of the former commentary about the rate cycle continuing, perhaps at a slower pace. What it speaks to is in inflation that hasn't been experienced in a generation here in the developed markets. Thanks for the nice intro. I manage a strategy that focuses on emerging markets. So when I look at where we are with the markets more broadly at the moment, I'm seeing investors looking around for growth and thinking about how are we going to capture growth like we've seen over the last decade in the years to come with inflation being where it is, with the rates rising as they are and continuing ahead. And continuing ahead.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1956,2022-11-22 20:53:25
19343," How are we going to capture growth, like we've seen over the last decade in the years to come with inflation being where it is, with the rates rising as they are and continuing ahead, investors who are looking for growth are starting to think beyond the single country, single sector or concentrated approach that's been successful over the last decade. And again, I'm as an emerging markets investor, I'm starting to feel quite optimistic about the opportunity ahead for markets outside of the US. As to you also think about emerging markets and or the intersection of emerging markets in Fintech. And I just think about, you know, and you think about innovation disruption, something we're going to talk a lot about with Kathy Wood in just about 10, 15 minutes time. But what's interesting too, and I think with the backdrop of FTX and Senn, Megman Friedleck, how are you thinking about that and the impact that they met that might have as kind of an investing class going forward? I think it's one of the most critical themes. And thanks for introducing my book, Power of Capital, it's an adventure capitalist journey, in which I introduced three megatheems that I see reshaping the growth. One of them is what we just talked about, the new global paradigm, the rise of the emerging markets and this new sort of growth class. Another one is around sustainable investing. But a critical theme is one you just mentioned technology. The reality is that the vast majority of the world's population today carries a supercomputer in their pockets. And in the emerging markets in particular, I see necessity as the mother of invention, an asset class that has had less access to liquidity. Today has a very strong young demographic, which we all know is very quick to pick up technology. Some of the most exciting and scalable technologies across the globe are coming from Africa, where mobile money was born, in China, where clean technology is hitting scale in India, where some of the strongest technology universities in the world reside. Couldn't agree more, technology is a critical megatheme and there's lots of opportunity, not just in the sector, but in the context of vertical integration. It transforms every sector from finance to consumer to retail. Well, help concentrate it a little bit or focus it a little bit for our audience. And I know you can't necessarily give picks, but can you get more specific with what you're bullish on and why? Yeah, so I just alluded to some of it. I'll spend a couple more moments on it. Mobile Money FinTech, which he just brought up, I think is one of those critical themes that's reshaping the opportunity across developed markets. We're all experiencing the rise of mobile money, the ability to pay for you. Are you separating this from crypto? I do separate it from crypto, but I do look at digital currencies as another important innovation that again, it has the opportunity to disrupt the opportunities ahead in terms of investing. I think of digital money in terms of new sectors, the ability to invest in small caps that are creating new forms of currency, but even in large cap financials, within emerging markets in particular, but with digital money, they're able to access the much larger demographic. And again, that creates opportunity, opportunity for revenue expansion across all aspects of the cap spectrum and opportunity for earnings expansion because the reality is technology, not particularly capital intensive. Asha, I do want to just, you know, did you have any exposure to the collapse of FTX in particular or any of the fallout? Thankfully, crypto is an area that I have limited exposure. I invested, like I said, an emerging market specifically in equities within that. Okay. Good to understand that. Okay, so can you talk about different regions? I mean, I know you mentioned India. I want to specifically focus on China, though, because we've been talking a lot in the last few days about the reopening in China versus, or I should say lack thereof, is the nation continues to at least talk about tens of thousands of cases that it's seen and report the first deaths over the weekend that we've seen in months in certain cities. What is your interpretation of what's happening in China? Is it investible right now? China is a large market, probably not surprising that I will inform you soon,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1957,2022-11-22 20:57:42
19344," What is your interpretation of what's happening in China? Is it investible right now? China is a large market probably not surprising to your sophisticated audience, but often a surprising to investors to recognize that China has the largest equity market in the world by liquidity. Well known that China is a geopolitical powerhouse and economically really one of the superpowers today. Yes absolutely, with COVID, the China growth story became a little bit more blemished, but we're starting to see the opportunity for China, even with just a few comments that came from President Xi earlier this month. The Chinese market is up more than 20% year to date with a lot of volatility embedded within that to your point on rising COVID numbers. I perhaps like you, I'm very bullish that when China does reopen, it has the opportunity not only to allow the Chinese markets to bounce back even stronger, but to have downstream effects where the rest of Asia is likely to benefit from a China reopening theme and the globe broadly. Again, with inflation being where it is to have China supply chain back on, that can have a massive deflationary effect that the whole globe is hungry for. Right. But I expect a bumpy ride as we've seen in November. I was going to say many would argue that it will continue to be a bumpy ride as it feels like sometimes policies coming out of China are one thing one day and another the following day. Asia, thank you so much. Asia Metta, founder, chief investment officer of Global Delta, capital, her book, Power of Capital, and Adventure capitalist journey to a sustainable future. All right, folks, just a few minutes left in today's trading session. We're pretty much trading nearer's our highs of the day. It is time to head over to our TV colleagues to talk about the trade today specifically and what's impacting markets. We're going to cap you down to the closing bell beyond the bell or simulcast live on Bloomberg Radio TV, YouTube, and on Bloomberg Quicktake. Beyond the Bell, Bloomberg's comprehensive cross-platform coverage of the U.S. Market closed darns right now. Right now, we are two minutes away from the end of the trading day, remain bostech, scroll it through, we're counting you down to the closing bell and here to help take us beyond the bell. It's our global simulcast with Carol Maser and Tim Stenevich, welcome to our audiences across Bloomberg Television, Bloomberg Radio, as well as on YouTube and Quicktake abroad based rally here. Carol Maser, as the S&P 500 sets up for its first close at 4,000 in a couple of months. Pretty amazing, right? And to see also once again, I know we've talked about lighter volume today ahead of the holiday, but we've seen some buying once again into the close. As for our performance, those retailers, I know Abercrombie and Fitch among them and a few other names coming in with results that certainly gave some enthusiasm to the investor community. So S&P 500, the supercomp, positive retailing industry index up about 1.4%. I'm not trying to reign on the parade here, but I was pretty surprised to see that on the S&P 500 over the last five days, even though this is the first time we've hit 4,000 or closed above 4,000 in months, remain, it's still up only three tenths of 1% over the last five days. Yeah, speaks to the volatility. Yeah, speaks to the volatility and speaks to the tightness of the trading range. And we should point out that when you go back to that September 12th number and where we went from September 12th to the low of the year, the year to date low, which was of course on October 12th, that was a 13% decline and we haven't recouped necessarily all of that just yet. So interesting moves here, Scarlet, and we've been talking here about how tight the trading ranges have been. I mean, even as we kind of break out a little bit here with a gain of better than 1% for the last seven trading days, the S&P 500 has not closed with the 1% move in either direction. And the last time it did was of course on the back of that October CPI report, which sparked that massive rally of almost a relief rally like, oh, in fact, inflation has peaked. Let's move on. Well, it'll be interesting too, because of course we get a couple of really interesting economic data reports, including that job's data in about a week's time. And then that night, by CPI number that comes the day before the Fed meeting, the Fed meeting, of course, concluding on December 14th. Here's the closing numbers here. The S&P 500 is going to close of 4,000, but just by the skin of its teeth, though, 4,000, 3.64. That's up about 54 points or about 1.4% on the day the Dow Jones industrial average, higher by about 1% closing above 34,000.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1958,2022-11-22 21:01:57
19345," than 3.64. That's up about 54 points or about 1.4% on the day the Dow Jones industrial average higher by about 1% closing above 34,000 and the NASDAQ composite higher by 1.4% closing right around 11,174 and the Russell 2000 similar gains at least on a percentage basis higher by 1.2% on the day. And remain you like to give the big numbers in terms of how they all closed on this Tuesday just digging a little bit deeper into the S&P 500 we'll get into the industry group shortly but 448 names in the S&P 500 higher so you saw some fairly broad-based buying in today's session 51 lower for unchanged Scarlett. Yeah you can back that up with a look at the sector performance here this is 24 industry groups in the S&P 500 and 23 groups are hired the only group that's basically unchanged is communications and professional services basically little change everything else is green across the board energy has led the way all day today as oil prices rise Saudi Arabia clarifying that if anything they might look at production cuts to keep oil prices elevated and chip companies up by 3.4% on a day should mention retailers as well as we wait for north from numbers to come out retailers are mixed bag but for now up by 1.3% as a group. Yeah and Scarlett I actually have a few retailers that are among the names the gainers that I want to highlight today first of all best by quite a rally up almost 13% here at the close top in the S&P 500 soaring the most since 2020 after modestly improving its profit forecast also signaling its recent sales lump is starting to e so lifting this year's forecast for operating income and comp sales also want to mention Burlington stores again another one that really stood out in today's session it was up about 20% after the company CEO said trends at the off-price retailer have improved from mid-October through November called the outlook for 2023 next year very positive and then I did want to mention the semiconductor space space where we really saw some outperformance today analog devices is one of the big reasons why top in the NASDAQ 100 up almost 6% in today's session giving a bullish forecast for the current periods are talking about the first quarter and saying that demand in their two markets that they really play into industrial equipment and cars are both holding up better than the broader chip industry fourth quarter results by the way also a beat so again this one was up about 6%. And I'll just add one to your board Manchester United those shares closing up 15% biggest one day gain on that stock trading here in the US. All right I'm not going to talk about sports because I already embarrassed myself talking about the world cup a little earlier today. Let's go to decliner securely got the gainers all look at the decliner I did want to check in on shares of Disney a day after posting its biggest single day gain in years after Bob Iger came back to replace Bob Chateback a little bit of selling today as investors continue to digest the news and understand what the rework ends up meaning down 1.4% today under performing the wider markets. A tale of two different types of earnings reports today when it came to retailers Dollar Tree finished and they down by 7.8%. Executives there said the company expects annual earnings per share to come in at the lower end of its previously given range due to higher costs leading to margin pressure. And then the medical tech company Medtronic down 5.3% it missed revenue expectations for the second quarter the company also cutting its adjusted EPS forecasts for the full year macro pressures including 4x in supply chain issues continue to hurt the company's results. All right yields are lower here on the day the two year yield though only down by about two basis points the bigger drops came in the belly of the curve in the long end of the curve six seven basis points on your 510 20 and 30 year you put it all together you got a two tens curve right now down in the whole negative 77 holding right now at the lowest level Scarlett that we've seen going back to 1981. Yeah I'm looking at it and it's been contracting where the yield curve has been more inverted for what five six seven days now seven three days nine if you want to include the the fact that it didn't change on Friday November 11th so it's interesting here what does that signal is it a stronger signal recession? I think so I mean we've been talking a lot about this particularly when you look at that 10 year yield and the idea here that it's going to drop a little bit faster and below where the Fed ends up when that terminal rate and I think that's what a lot of people are concerned about right now you guys saw that new note out from Goldman that said the 10-year yield is going to be above 4% through 2024 right interesting to hear that given that we've only seen the 10-year yield up what 22 days so far this year above 4% so that you know portends what a rocky 2023 and 2024. Yeah a lot to part.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1959,2022-11-22 21:06:16
19346," the 10-year yield up what, 22 days so far this year, about 4%. So that, you know, portends what, a Rocky 2023 and 2024? Yeah, a lot to parse here, definitely when it comes to the macro, also going to talk to the micro, I'm going to say goodbye, at least for now, to Jim Stenevik and Carol Maser wrapping up our cross-platform coverage of the market clothes, right here on Bloomberg Television Radio as well, as on YouTube. So is this? All right, and we do our thanks to both for being in Scarlett in terms of talking about the market clothes. We've got a great guest. I want to get right to her, delighted to have back with us to talk about so many of the things that really have preoccupied us over the last couple of weeks. Kathy Wood is back with us. She's the founder, CEO and chief investment officer of ARK Invest, joining us via Zoom. Kathy, it is so great to have you here with Tim and myself, live on Radio TV across all the Bloomberg platforms. How are you? Doing very well. It's been a very challenging few, well, I should say 20 months, but we're looking at our portfolios right now. And we are back to where we were in terms of calling them deep-value portfolios if you give us a five-year investment time horizon. I mean, we're seeing incredible values for the kinds of growth, the kind of growth that our portfolios are going to deliver. You know where I want to go. I've got to talk to you about the crypto space. You know, it's a world you know really well. We think about the FTX collapse, the bankruptcy proceedings today, the coming undone of Sandbeckman-Freed. You know, you have been buying into some of the different names in the crypto space coin base, a great scale Bitcoin trust. Why should investors trust crypto? Why do you trust crypto at this point? Yes, if you look at the blockchain, let's use the Bitcoin blockchain and Ethereum. What you'll find is they have the infrastructure, the technology has not skipped a beat throughout this entire crisis. In fact, the big coins hash rate is at an all-time high. And that is a real indication of the security of the network. On Ethereum, we're seeing the total value staked at 24 billion. That is an all-time high. So we think the infrastructure is working beautifully. As far as coin base, this is an onshore regulated company and wanting to help shape regulations. Brian Armstrong, the CEO and Alicia, CFO have been leaning into what's going on right now and saying, okay, regulators, we need more clarity in order to protect investors. Those who wanted to get involved with certain types of crypto were forced off shore and look at what's happened. So I think that coin base is going to come out here looking very, very strong. It just lost a very big competitor in ITX. Well, what is the market missing, though, because that could be one narrative, Kathy, but at the same time, we haven't exactly seen shares of coin base rallies since FTX has collapsed. Do you think to you that represents potentially broader concern about just people's interest in crypto following FTX has collapsed? No, I think it's more fear. I think many people say we don't know what we don't know. And so what we do is we step back, put a little perspective into the situation here and what do we have? So the entire crypto asset ecosystem is an $800 billion ecosystem. Apple is three times larger in terms of market cap. So that's some perspective. Many people are saying, well, okay, is this another Lehman? Could this be, could we see the domino effect here? I've just given you one reason why, the banking system back in 0809, trillions and trillions of dollars. And it was the global banking system. Right now, we have, it seems, from FTX, $5 to $10 billion in creditors. If, as a...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1960,2022-11-22 21:10:35
19347," Right now, we have, it seems, from FTX, five to ten billion dollars in creditors, as FTX has filed bankruptcy, they will be making claims. If you look at Lehman, that was $1.2 trillion in claims. So again, just trying to put perspective, this is fraud. This is made off, made off was $64 billion in claims. Again, FTX, five to ten billion. Now I know that crypto assets are, you know, they attract a lot of attention. This is, you know, the three revolutions we talk about all the time, you know, a new monetary system in terms of the first global private, meaning not government control, digital, rules-based monetary system. That's Bitcoin, a very big idea. DeFi is a very big idea. And while that has been thrown into question in terms of, you know, shifting from one exchange to another, we've had a lot of shifting around. But I think, I think DeFi, in terms of taking the middlemen out of financial services and making the ecosystem much more transparent with much less counterparty risk, is going to take off. It will continue to move forward, we believe. Kat, I think one of the things we're trying to figure out is how long that we think the industry will be feeling the ramifications of FTX. I mean, one thing we've learned, right, with SBF and FTX is what we didn't know. So how long do you think this goes on? Because you obviously have faith in it. You've been buying into it. And you think this is a good entry point at this point, whether it's grayscale, whether it's coinbase. But how long do you think we continue to feel the effect? And do you think there's more contagion to be felt? Well, we always look for the whale in a situation like this. And if there was a whale out there, it was FTX and San Benjamin freed King of the Hill. So I think we found the whale. And I'm sure there's going to be more fallout, but we see how big the whale is. And yes, a lot of people have lost a lot of money around the crypto-acid ecosystem losing value here. But if we're right on the underlying technology and the underlying roles, the Bitcoin and Ether Ethereum are going to play in this new world, then I think we're going to recover pretty quickly. You mentioned that FTX was a quote fraud. It's no Lehman or no Maid off. Give us an understanding of what your interactions were like Maid off. More like Maid off. Yeah, oh my gosh. So we'll give us an understanding of what your interactions were with San Benjamin freed before this fallout. And have you spoken to him? Because I know you were at crypto-bahamas, along with many other people earlier this year, the FTX Salt Conference. Yes, I had a Zoom. My team and I had a Zoom with San before that conference. I think they wanted to have us represented at the conference. And so I did give a presentation there where I was on a panel. But other than that one phone call, just a set up, I have never talked to him. And he, by the end of the phone call, seemed to be distracted by whatever else he was doing. So that was my one exposure to him. And I think the thing that is shocking is how many people were very close to him. And one would have presumed, looked at all of the documents and got a sense of the books. The fact that so many people were completely fooled is quite shocking. And I think he had this aura around him or something that caused people to ask fewer questions than might otherwise have been the case. It's very hard to understand. Do you worry at all about it as you buy into grayscale Kathy, the whole world of the digital currency group and Barry Silver's company? I mean, the various connections that kind of show a involving a lot of that kind of rings from the digital currency group. And DJP coins could be found as a corresponding background notion in it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1961,2022-11-22 21:15:00
19348," Do you worry at all about as you buy into grayscale, Kathy? You know, the whole world of the digital currency group and Barry Silver's company, I mean, the various connections that kind of go back to FTX. Are you at all worried about a liquidation or anything? Well, we know that the grayscale investment trusts are the most valuable part of that company right now. And they are cash cows, they're revenue generating. We do not think we think they're going to try and hold on to that if nothing else. So we are looking at a 41 percent discount of this first relative to Bitcoin today. And so we actually think there's a lot of upside. Now, one of the things that we know that grayscale and Michael Sánon-Chime at grayscale wanted was to convert this trust into an ETF. Right. I think what's happened with the fallout here might increase the probability that a Bitcoin ETF will be approved. I'm not saying immediately. But we know that, and even the newest SEC commissioner, Jaime Lizaraga, I think, is his name, has come out and said, we need more, we need as regulators to focus on decentralization and transparency. What is the most decentralized and transparent crypto asset in the world? It is Bitcoin. And yet retail investors do not have easy access through a liquid asset like an ETF, which, which honestly, I don't understand, given that they approved a Bitcoin futures fund. So, you know, I think it might increase the odds, we shall see. Well, and some have been wondering whether or not you're playing the arbitrage with GBTC right now. You know, is it that because of the trust deep discount at this point? Is that the thinking for you to kind of be moving more money into this name? Well, it is one of the few securities. We have to own securities in ETFs. So, it is one of the few securities we can buy. And yes, it's at a very big discount. So, it is more attractive. Bitcoin, Bitcoin, if they were to even liquidate it, you know, we've got such a big discount relative to Bitcoin that, again, we don't think they're going to. This is the most valuable property. I think they're going to hang on to it. And I think over time, the discount will close. Don't know if it's because of a conversion to a Bitcoin ETF. I'm sure the regulators will take a very close look at DCG and the gray scale Bitcoin Investment Trust. But we do know this is a grant or trust highly regulated, highly regulated. I mean, we have to do our homework on it. And we know that all of the Bitcoin behind GBTC is in cold storage at Coinbase. And Coinbase has confirmed this. So, you know, we feel quite comfortable with it here. Kathy, we've talked Coinbase. We've talked GBTC. Are there any other opportunities in crypto that you see right now in the wake of FTX's collapse as prices have been beaten up? Well, again, for our ETFs, we, as you mentioned, on Coinbase. We also own Square. And it is interesting that Jack Dorsey has chosen the most transparent, most decentralized crypto asset to center blocks crypto exposure to. And I realize he's trying to, from a developer community point of view, leave them on their own. But we do think Bitcoin, and you can see through the behavior of the infrastructure, hasn't skipped a beat, not one beat, more secure than it was yesterday, the day before and the day before. So, I have a feeling this is going to elevate Bitcoin in the eyes of not only the crypto world, but the investment world at large. And I have a feeling it's going to have more running real.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1962,2022-11-22 21:19:07
19349," in the eyes of not only the crypto world, but the investment world at large. And I have a feeling it's going to have more running room through the rest of the world. I think this is the way that this is blocked, go to market to get into the rest of the world. And I, we think they're going to be very successful. So then I'm assuming, Kathy, that you're going to hold to your Bitcoin forecast for, what is it, a million per coin by 2030? That still feels good to you. Yes. And you can, you know, sometimes you need to battle test. You need to go through crises to see who the real, to see the survivors, first of all, but really to test battle test, the infrastructure and the thesis. And again, we think Bitcoin is coming out of this smelling like a rose because of what I have mentioned previously. And I do think that the one thing that will be delayed is perhaps institution stepping back and just saying, okay, do we really understand this? And once they actually do the homework and see what's happened here, I think they might be more comfortable moving into, into Bitcoin and perhaps ether as a first stop. You know, as they'll understand it more. You mentioned Jack Dorsey. I want to switch gears if I can. And I was thinking about Twitter and Tesla. Like I said, there's so many things that are going on in our world right now that I feel like you are the person to comment on. How do you make sense of Elon Musk? Someone you know you've talked to, you've been an investor in Tesla for a long time. Are you comfortable with his actions around Twitter of firing people, hiring them back, you know, the verified check, talking about people paying for it and then taking that back. Do you feel comfortable with this name? And I should put out that right, you own private shares of Twitter and I've talked about wanting to own more. Yes. Yes, we do. We saw, we owned Twitter for quite a while and we sold it into the rumors that Elon was going to buy it because we knew there would be a lot of controversy around that. So it moved into the 60s. I think it got to 70 and we sold there. And have been watching, have been watching from the sidelines. But if you look at that model longer run, it has not delivered on the promise. And, you know, I think opening up the algorithms which we think he will do and taking away the kind of human driven censorship and allowing the transparency of the algorithms that they do put out there and, you know, allowing people to question them, I think it's going to be very healthy. If you look at the daily average users, I think the various metrics that you can count daily, they have been going up dramatically. So, you know, if you, I know a lot of people who, you know, basically decided to quit Twitter because they didn't like the kind of censorship and so forth that was going on. So I actually like what he's doing. It seems interestingly enough though that a lot of brands don't like what he's doing. And we've seen some prominent companies pull back or at least pause advertising on the platform. Of course, I mean, that makes sense. You know, you don't necessarily want to support the guy who owns Tesla. If you're making, you know, competitive, competitive, yeah, competitive vehicles to Tesla. But bigger brands that are worried about brand safety. And I'm wondering, you know, I don't know what you're seeing in your Twitter timeline. But I'm seeing ads that are what not relevant to me anymore and not relevant to me now. And aren't actually ads that are for companies. They're more like ads for influencers these days. It doesn't seem like it's necessarily moving in the direction of increasing revenue from an adversarial perspective right now. Well, I do think that this is not, this is not just an advertising vehicle. In fact, this is, that probably might diminish quite significantly in terms of its importance longer run. You'll remember that Elon started his entrepreneurial pursuits. With a precursor to PayPal. So he, a very long time ago, had this idea of a digital wallet, a super app like WhatsApp in mind. And of course.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1963,2022-11-22 21:23:31
19350," One time ago, I had this idea of a digital wallet, a super app, like what's app in mind. And of course, took a big detour into another passion of his. We know he knows a lot about this world. And I think if anyone in the U.S. can do this, I think he can. I think he'll surround himself by the right business leaders. He's not going to do this himself. If you look at Tesla, he's not, you know, if you look at many people say, aren't you worried about Tesla? No, we're not, because of our work on electric vehicles. They are grabbing a disproportionate share and will continue to do so of a market that we think by 2027 will account for 85 to 95 percent of all cars sold in the world. So that's on automatic pilot. He's now working on autonomous, which we think is going to work. In fact, I just had the pleasure of riding in a cruise car in San Francisco, an autonomous car. A GM. A GM. Just wanted to see, wanted to check it out. And I have to tell you, I love the ride. And I know autonomous is possible because cruise and Waymo are doing it. And we think Tesla is going to do it in a much bigger way. So that's Tesla. But on to Twitter, it really needed to be shaken up. And I think he can make it be a great business and very profitable. And if so, how? I do. I do think about the amount of data that Twitter has. And it's proprietary data. And think about the combination of that and artificial intelligence. Remember, he has AI expertise and experts. I know he brought in some of his engineers. And they are going to, I think, surprise and delight, heading for a super app kind of product. And by our estimates, and you'll find this in our big ideas, I think it was 2021, the value of each customer in a digital wallet should be, and when I say that, the market cap associated, should be in the 20,000 plus range. Because not just for financial services, it will ultimately be for commerce. And AI is the glue that's going to pull this all together. And the data that they have, the data is the new oil. You've heard that. This is absolutely true in the case of Twitter. Well, Kathy, I mean, the currency, Twitter, as a currency, has worked really well for you. You've got 1.5 million followers on the platform. A lot of people see what you tweet. We saw eulogies last week being written for Twitter. It didn't end up dying as many people thought it would. But what would happen if Twitter went away? And are you concerned about that? You know, it's been, and yes, we speak from experience. This is an extremely productive social network for us. It is our most productive. And it truly is the global public town square. You know, I can write an open letter to the Fed and put it out over Twitter. Now, do I think the Fed's going to listen to me? No, I don't. But they may listen, the Fed board members may listen to someone who might think that I have something to say, which is simply a question. Wait a minute. How can you be unanimous? 75 basis points at a time. How can you be unanimous when there is so much conflicting data out there, including an inverted yield curve now at 75 basis points? That's crazy. I think we're going to look back in history and say, what were they thinking? unanimous commodity prices are falling. You've got excess inventories all over the place. We're seeing massive discounting. I think we're going to see deflation. And then they'll make a move in the opposite direction. But we need a steadier hand than that. Wait, Kathy, when do you, because you've argued this, and you've put this out there in terms of Fed policy, in terms of deflation, when do you think it will come? I think we're seeing it. I think so.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1964,2022-11-22 21:27:50
19351," And you, because you've argued this and you put this out there in terms of fed policy, in terms of deflation, when do you think it will come? I think we're seeing it. I think if you look at a lot of commodity prices, not only are they down 30 to some of them 80% from their peaks, they're down on a year-over-year basis. In fact, oil itself is almost down on a year-over-year basis now. The big pushbacks on this call we get are wages and rents. We're seeing rent inflation reverse quite suddenly and dramatically. So what I think we will look back in history and say, this inflation shock was the function of a supply shock caused by COVID, supply chain problems afterwards, and even more problems after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. If I can just take one second, I would like to give an analogy to the late 19 teens. We were in the middle of the most massive innovation, the history of the world had seen. Telephone, electricity, and automobile all at the same time. But we had World War I and we had the Spanish flu, sound familiar. Now, that was much worse than what we've gone through. We've gone through nothing like that. But there were massive supply chain problems back then. An inflation peaked at 24%. Right? June of 1920. And by June of 1921, it was minus 15%. So I think that our 8% to 10% inflation, which is where it was at the peak, is going to turn around. And we're going to see some very big surprises on the inflation front. And you know who agrees with us? The bond market. Look at what the bond market is doing now. The bond yield. Yeah, 380. 75% is inverted. That's telling us that the bond market is saying recession and or big surprises on the low side of inflation expectations. So, and it's properly both. Kathy, I'm fortunate we only have a couple minutes left here. One thing we did want to squeeze in. We've been talking about it in the newsroom that Alliance Bernstein is getting ready to launch actively managed disrupted, disrupted ETFs. And from what I understand, you pitched them, you know, years ago. How does that make you feel and, you know, to see a firm from that you worked at kind of doing a very similar thing or looking to do something similar? Yes. Well, Alliance Bernstein, I believe, got the first fully active, fully transparent ETF. And I think it was early, it got the, it was approved in early 2013. So that's when I put my hand up and said, I'll do that. And there were, there was a belief that ETFs were not safe or, you know, there were a lot of arguments against it. Probably the biggest one was mutual funds, which are much more profitable, I would say, the economics there are higher than ETFs. How does it make me feel? You know, I'm the more the merrier. I think this is a fantastic wrapper for the end consumer. It's fully liquid, unlike mutual funds, you have to wait till the end of the day, transparent, fully transparent. That's what, that's what investors want. It is more tax effective, much more tax effective. You're seeing mutual funds that are down 30% this year, but they're slapping their investors with 35% in capital tax gains. And then finally, it's more cost effective when you, because all of the, what you see is what you get with these fees. There aren't a bunch of hidden fees. So it's a great wrapper for the end consumer. I highly recommend it. We're happy that they are seeing the light now. All right. Well, good to get you to weigh in on that. And just so much more. Kathy, we always appreciate your time. Be well. Have a great Thanksgiving. Kathy would, CEO, CIO, and of course, founder of ARC Invest, joining us there via Zoom. All right.

Hi, thank you very much. Kathy Wood making news moments ago She spoke to us right here on Bloomberg Business week Kathy Wood of the arch-innovation fund says she is standing by Elon Musk and the changes he is making at Twitter if you look at the the daily average users I think the various metrics that you can count daily they have been going up dramatically. So, you know, if you I know a lot of people who you know, they basically decided to quit Twitter because they didn't like the kind of censorship and so forth that was going on.

I'm Charlie Pellet and that is a Bloomberg business flash. All right Charlie Thank you so much. You're listening and watching Bloomberg Business Week on this Tuesday Well in the week of an eye you can go from CEO to former CEO as was the case as you know Of now former Walt Disney CEO Bob Chapeck as the Disney board went from right leader at the right time to wrong leader for today Just about five months. We got Chris Paul Mary with us. He's entertainment editor for Bloomberg News He joins us via zoom from Los Angeles. Chris what happened here because just a couple of months ago I believe it was the code conference in LA Bob Eiger was asked specifically Uh by Cara Swisher if he was going to come back as CEO and he pretty much He ruled it out. I won't even say he pretty much ruled it out. He absolutely ruled it out. What happened in such a short time Well, I mean yeah, this this this happened very quickly in fact We're told that he got the call just on Friday To come back um, you know, he'd been making a lot of plans. He's been joining a partner in venture capital firm He'd been making personal investments. He was in talks with other people of you know about joining Companies as recently as last week You know, this was a hard one to read because Chapeck Bob Chapeck was in trouble No doubt he was very unpopular internally and the stock had taken a beating this year But the board had renewed his contract in just in June and gave him a vote of confidence at the time uh, you know in retrospect That was that was probably a bad move on the board's part because uh, you know the the drum beat against him just continued and uh, stock did even worse than the Uh a couple weeks ago the earnings release was just terrible and uh and at that point, you know The everyone just sort of said it's time to go but Chris Bob Chapeck was not new to Disney Like he was hand picked he was hand picked by Bob Eiger Yes, uh, he was and uh, that was of course after Eiger had Renewed his is contracting delayed his retirement at least four times So a lot of the people were talent that people talked about for years as probably possible successors had left the company by that time Chapeck was sort of the nod on everybody's top list as a pick for CEO other than perhaps Bob Eiger's And their relationship went sour pretty quickly after Eiger gave him the nod Uh, it seems that you know, Eiger probably wanted a little bit more appreciation Uh and involvement in decision making and Chapeck really wanted to run his own show and chafe that the You know sort of a second guessing he was getting uh, so You know, he made a lot of the steps uh, you know, obviously the the Florida led",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1966,2022-11-22 21:36:30
19353," the sort of second guessing he was getting. So he made a lot of the steps, obviously the Florida legislation that he initially did not oppose was made him very unpopular internally. He did a big re-imagination reorganization that took away a lot of decision-making authority from the TV network heads and the film studio heads and all the people who were used to making decisions on what film and TV shows to make and add sales and distribution deals and all that stuff. And he was unpopular with a lot of people who were just regular Disney fans. He had done a lot at the theme parks to raise prices, and introduced this new line cutting system. And in effect was another large price hike. He required reservations that was really troubling to a lot of season pass holders who found that they couldn't get in and even though they had passes. So, Chapeck just managed to annoy a whole lot of people. So if Bob Eiger said no, would Chapeck still be there? Yeah, because I mean one of the things from this is that they really didn't have a bench that they could rely on. They're the fact that they went back to the old guy. He says that there was nobody internally that they could pick. Do you find it interesting? Do you remember years ago when you, you know, I was out doing some stuff on Disney. You were great as a resource. And I was talking to Disney. And remember, it was like Tom Stags and was it Ruzulo? The Sea Vault, these switch jobs, because those two were considered to be in the running. Like there was a bench. Yeah, there was a bake off and Stags appeared to one. They elevated him to chief operating officer. Ruzulo laughed, you know, in the midst of that aunt Sweeney and other highly regarded executive around the TV business left. Then, you know, even more race recently, you have Ken Mayer who did this, you know, amazing launch of the strategy chief that launched the Disney Plus product, 10 million subscribers in the first day, if you remember. And then he got passed over in favor of Chepek. And then he left. And then he left immediately. Yeah. Yeah. And so there's been a lot of talent that they might have been in the right place to take over that just left, given the process. OK, here we are, day two of Bob Eiger's new reign at Disney. Chop Chop, two years only, the contract. Right. So he's got a lot of work to do. We saw a memo yesterday that he sent out. We saw executives leave and also a re-organization already happening. What are the changes that we can expect in the near future and over the next two years? Well, right away, you saw him start to unravel some of the decisions making that Chepek had made. For example, that reorganization that created this central distribution arm to make all the decisions, business decisions about the film and TV shows, the Kareem Daniel, the executive who added that was out the door. Day one. And there's a lot of unresolved things that I imagine Eiger will tackle pretty quickly. For example, they have a deal to buy one third of Hulu from Comcast. A lot of people have been asking questions about that. And so I imagine that that will get executed at some point. They have this situation in Florida with this reedy, creek improvement district that it got taken away from them by the Florida legislature this year. They're probably going to have to negotiate some sort of future for that business. I imagine Eiger will be involved in that. And he's got to stem the losses in this streaming business of $1.5 billion less quarters, just staggering them out. So he's got to figure out a way to rationalize that. Chris, I was thinking about it coming in when we knew we were going to cover this today. Just got about 35 seconds here. What contributes the most profitability to Disney today? And where's the fastest growth? No, quickly. Well, the most profits still come from the traditional TV business, which people want us to spin off, about $8 billion last year in profits from the ESPN, ABC, and all that. Second business businesses, the parks, another about $8 billion profit business. And the business that's losing money is streaming. Lost about $4 billion last year. So. What's growing the fastest in terms of profits? Is it streaming growth in terms of revenue? Well, in terms of revenue, for sure. That's the fastest growing business. And that way, let's face it, is the future of TV. Interesting times we are living in. Chris Paul Mary, you're all over at Entertainment Editor Blumberg News via Zoom in LA.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1967,2022-11-22 21:40:54

We go from LA to our 99 one studio in Washington DC where we find Nancy Lyon. Hey, Nancy. Thanks, Tim. The Supreme Court has cleared the way for the handover of Donald Trump's tax returns. The court rejected a last ditch effort by the former president to block the IRS from turning over the documents. The House Ways and Means Committee had been racing the calendar to obtain the records before Republicans assumed control of the House in January. The committee said it needs the returns to consider potential legislation on presidential compliance with tax rules. Trump's lawyers argued the panel lacked a legitimate legislative purpose and were seeking to make the documents public for political reasons. Jill Schneider, Bloomberg Radio. Also happening today, federal prosecutors are going head to head with Trump's lawyers in an Atlanta courtroom, they're appealing the appointment of an outside special master to review Trump's claims that those documents are covered by legal protections. Americans are being urged to update their COVID and flu shots before winter comes. Dr. Anthony Fauci and what will likely be his final news conference before retiring next month says the new byvalent vaccine provides superior protection.

You are listening and watching Bloomberg Business Week on this Tuesday. Carol Masser along with Tim Stenevich and a few earnings that came out after the closing bell. We had Nordstrom come out. Third quarter adjusted EPS, seven cents better than forecast. Revenues were slightly better than forecast and it also came out in terms of the outlook and it says it's on pace to achieve 2022 revenue adjusted earnings outlook and says it sees fiscal year revenue up five to seven percent. So quick check on Nordstrom in the aftermarket. It is down though about 4.5 percent. Yeah, the stock dropping after, but you know, spiking initially, Carol, and you know, we can't read too much into an immediate move at before a conference call comes out. But like you mentioned, the company out with earnings, we're seeing other companies report earnings as well. What else do you have your eye on? Well, and I just want to say that some of the looks like the reaction in Nordstrom shares here in the aftermarket sinking in late trading after reporting a decrease in profitability in a mid-hired discounting. So this is something we will watch when it comes to the retail. I do want to go to the commentary from Eric Nordstrom CEO of the company. He said, quote, when customer demand decelerated in late June, we took action to align inventory and expenses with the changing trends, which has prepared us to navigate the current macroeconomic environment. This quarter, our teams continue to advance are closer to use strategy and supply chain capabilities as we focus on initiatives to drive profitable growth and achieve our long-term strategic and financial goals. Interesting to hear the demand decelerated in late June. Yeah, that is kind of interesting. Really? Yeah, and they play into a higher end, I would say, when it comes to the retail market. Hey, HP also out with their results, uh, planning 4,000 to 6,000 job cuts by the end of fiscal 2025, they gave, uh, some of a forecast for the first quarter, just at EPS of 70 to 80 cents. The estimate that's out there is 86 cents a share. So again, another big tech firm talking about cutting jobs. If I look at HP shares here in the after hours, they're actually up about 1%. Investors might say, hey, you're getting control on costs and that can potentially bode well. Yeah, the company also is saying a forecast assuming a 10% decline in computer sales. It's according to the CEO, who said that to Bloomberg News in an interview. Yeah, PC demand writes still down.

That is a Bloomberg Business Flash. Alright Charlie, thank you so much. So you all might recall we recently talked with the president of L'Oreal Paris USA. She's a USA Ali Goldstein about women of worth. It's the company's annual honoring of women who are committed to improving the lives and worlds of vulnerable communities. And these women are recognized and then given a major assist in their mission. Thanks to L'Oreal and that is in terms of support and helping them and also financially. Well we got one of those women with us this afternoon. Susan Burton is the founder of a new way of life. She joins us this afternoon on Zoom from Los Angeles. You can follow her on Twitter at Susan Burton LA. Susan, good to have you with us. How are you? I am good. It's great to be here. It's really great to have you. I got to tell you you have just such an incredible story. Can you share with our audience how you got to where you are today and what you went through? Yeah, so I went through a lot. But ultimately I was incarcerated and after incarceration I really really struggled to get back, you know, to get on my feet, not back on my feet, but to get on my feet. And I felt miserably over and over again and would land back in prison and then someone helped me. And when they helped me, you know, I was able to like sort of like pick up my bed and walk. And I thought about all the other women coming on from prison like me and what would they do? So I started a new way of life reentry project back in 1998. In my home, I would welcome women from prison and we created a community of women helping women and we recovered. You know, just is amazing. What can happen when someone helps another person? Tell us, take us back because as you said, Susan, you know, you were dealing with the prison system for a long time. I mean, what was it like when you first came out and just what you were faced with? Oh my god, it was so daunting. You know, I was released, put on a bus, given $200, dropped off, driven on the bus to downtown LA, the Greyhound bus station, which is downtown LA Skid Row. It's probably the biggest Skid Row in the country. You have no ID, you have no, you know, basically in nowhere to go, nowhere that's healthy to go. And you know, you want to do the best, you want to be your best, but you're just ill equipped. So I felt missively over and over again till someone helped me. You know, you can just imagine the anxiety of not being equipped, but the excitement and the hope also at the same time just whirling around in your mind and your body. And it's something that we need to look at as a country. And then we wonder why people either land back in prison to be quite honest with you, right? If you're not necessarily given the skills, the tools, whatever. What are those tools and skills?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1970,2022-11-22 21:53:52
19357," And then we wonder why people either land back in prison to be quite honest with you, right? If you're not necessarily given the skills, the tools, whatever. What are those tools and skills, Susan? What were you provided? What was that turning point when you were provided, what were you provided with? I was provided with a safe environment that was drug and alcohol-free. It was a rehab. I was provided with clothing. I was providing with social services. I got therapy. I was introduced to AA. I'm 25 years, so just opportunity. I was given opportunity to go to a workforce development site. I was given community, but most of all, I was safe and I was in a place that welcomed me. It's funny. I think about not funny, actually. As we continue to Susan look at our prison systems, right? We all are like, oh, I can't believe. Why is it that recidivism? This happens so often people find their way back, but many would argue that the current prison system and what we do in terms of reform, quote unquote, it doesn't actually reform individuals. What's been your experience in working with a new way of life and helping people? What happens to those people that just come out and have assistance and a hand and getting back to a normal life? It's just a real game changer for them. We have over 90% success rate and what we provide is basic housing, family reunification services, job readiness. We help people go back to school. We help them get their children back. We allow them the space to be safe and also to begin the journey of healing. We're talking about women here. We're talking about women who have really not given and been given opportunity. Many times we say, oh, let's give them a second chance. But when I sit down and talk with the women and talk about their childhood and their experience as teenagers and as a young woman, a new way of life is their first chance. It's so clear that something is missing from the criminal justice system here in the United States that we even need an organization like yours, Susan, and we know we need it. I'm wondering in the years since you started a new way of life back in 1998, to what extent you've actually been able to engage with decision makers in this country, those who would be able to make decisions to provide services like yours when women are released from prison. So they don't find themselves in a situation like you found yourself in. You know, this is where change needs to happen is with policy and laws. So I engage. I engage with busley. I engage deeply. They know Miss Burton. I love that. So test. They know Miss Burton and they enjoy, I believe, engaging with me because they know what I do is effective. Well, and you have an understanding, right, that like none other. Hey, tell us, I'm just got 30 seconds here very quickly. Laurel, what can you do with the raised visibility in their platform? And what would you like to do going forward and just very quickly if you could? Yes. And you know, the resources that we give from Laurel will help from the resources we give from Laurel Paris will help to raise the visibility. And it would also help me help the women that come home. Right. And, you know, I just have to say with Laurel, when I got the announcement that I was one of the women, I was so excited. So Laurel Paris, thank you. And thank you, Bill Vergrady. Oh, you're very kind. Susan Burton, founder, a new way of life joining us via Zoom from LA. Women of Worth, Laurel Paris, USA, their program really about giving back. We did it. We did it.

19359," Let's check in on these markets because actually we pushed higher now remember this is a holiday shortened week This means volumes are thin and they're down about 20% from your average But the SB500 managed to climb back to the highest level since mid-September We thank in large part apple Microsoft some of your big tech heavyweights Which push these overall indexes high and Nasdaq at 1.4 so too is a Nasdaq 100 let's flip it gone though Because there was a little bit of optimism in the air when it comes to crypto too But actually is this more a story of dollar weakness than of course crypto strength over the last two trading days We know it's been under pressure, but look at this push higher a little bit one point trading up above $16,000 when we're looking at Bitcoin Ed Yeah, some big news in the last hour car at HP ink will cut up to 6000 jobs over the next three years Representing a slow down in demand for personal computers that is its earnings disappoint The stock actually higher now in after hours It kind of been all over the place, but a big story will continue to monitor earnings continues to be a big story Right look at some of the movers specific stocks we've been watching throughout the session analog devices a bullish forecast $3.15 billion for the next three months that's Setting it apart from the rest of the chip industry. It's weathering the storm in that sense zoom slowest quarter of growth on record We will talk to this here for about that China another big story I've been looking at the US listed shares of Chinese tech stocks by do outperforming Cost cuts seem to do well surprise revenue growth for internet giant by do and then the other story we're watching JD.com cutting manager salaries by 10 to 20 percent then Dispersing that money amongst the greater workforce kind of aligning itself with G's common prosperity Initiative really interesting story on the Bloomberg terminal and something's changing out there when it comes to China tech Yeah, really great global perspective Let's bring it back closer to home It's a global story of course because it hits across the world the FTX story and we emerged well from the first FTX bankruptcy Hearing on Tuesday and it included an attorney representing the firm saying a substantial amount of FTX's assets are well Missing let's break it all down in most Katie grife felt shock or we're almost becoming numb to it to certain degree Katie But what did you take away from the first hearing was a fiery first day? I would say in addition to what you were saying about you know the asset either being lost or stolen This back and forth on the top 50 biggest creditors the fact that their names are redacted We don't know who they are that was an interesting storyline for me because it's really unusual that actually their names Wouldn't be made public but there were at least two groups of Crypto creditors they sent their lawyers there one of those lawyers was protecting or were was working for Members of that top 50 groups really arguing that their identities should be kept secret and for now We know that they're going to remain unidentified. That's interesting when you try to map the contagion about what more shoes Are we waiting to drop we would like to know who's on that list, but it's going to remain under wraps for now Missing assets also a debate around the assets and who should be doing what about what talked us about what's happening in parallel in the Bahamas Katie well, that's the thing who actually what court has jurisdiction here is going to handle it That's been a sort of turf turf war that has erupted here We know that for now these doing liquidation proceedings in the Bahamas. They're going to be transferred to Delaware You're still going to have FTX is US restructuring advisors and regulators in the Bahamas They're going to try to work out rules for sharing the information, but for right now again It looks like that's being transferred to Delaware All right bloombos Katie Griefeld. Thank you very much Let's continue the conversation with Raghu Yalagada CEO of the crypto trading platform Falcon X and Raghu You have a history with FTX which we'll get to but I first want to ask you What are you seeing among your user base customer base in crypto markets? What does that reflect based on what's happening with FTX and the fallout from it? Absolutely first off good to be back What we're seeing in the broader customer sentiment is definitely The first few weeks were shock Right because everyone knew that Almeida was a counterparty on FTX But the lack of separation between these counterparties was a huge shock now essentially all the customers Chatter is all about which shoe is going to drop next so people are paying",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1973,2022-11-22 22:06:54
19360," Separation between these counterparties was a huge shock. Now, essentially, all the customers chatter is all about which shoe is going to drop next. So people are paying a lot of attention to exchanges specifically. So specifically to Asian exchanges, people are doing extended due diligence and making sure that things are okay there. But everyone is like very cautious at the moment. So your relationship with FTX, you did transact through FTX. Explain your historical relationship with FTX and where it stands now. Yeah, so we did have Alameda as one of our trading parties as we started the business. But a few weeks to a month before this entire contagion, we stopped, we unmanned the relationships of zero exposure to Alameda. So as one of the largest brokerages on the planet, we do work with one of the largest liquidity providers out there, which is FTX. We have a small relative to our balance sheet position on FTX, but we are in a very good place right now. When were the drools were stopped? Did you have assets on the platform, Raghu? Could you repeat that again? When were the drools from FTX were stopped? Were you left with any assets for other counterparties on their platform? So if I understand your question correctly, I mean about the assets on the platform. So essentially what we're going to see is like, this is going to be an extremely complex legal situation. So multiple jurisdictions, multiple assets, multiple regulators and wall. So we're all prepared for a very long, drawn out legal process. So that's what us and a lot of our customers are getting up to. The second aspect of it is a lot of information is missing. Today's hearing was a very good starting point, but at the same time, we didn't get a lot of material information just yet. So what we are seeing in the debt markets is, or essentially people trading the claims is, three to five cents on the dollar is where things are being priced in. At the moment. Okay, but any of any assets that you were helping manage and move around, were they trapped in any way? Did you thought were your immediate reaction function at your business when with drools were halted at FTX? So first thing that we were looking at is, essentially the news flow and all the information was quite confusing at the start for everyone, right? Because it was a shock to the industry, the notion that there is a massive liquidity crisis at FTX is definitely a surprise to us as well. But at the same time, we were well operating within our risk tolerance, and that is the advantage of coming to a broker versus going directly to an exchange. So we have a specified amount of funds that we did not cross at FTAFTAX or any other exchange that's out there. That was the reason why we walked out of this with a small position relative to our balance sheet. Right. Can you give us any size or scope on how your business has been hit by a lack of faith now in the industry broadly, a lack of trust now in the industry broadly? Yeah. So Q2, Q3 were record volumes with record number of customers onboarded for the company, Ed. But if you look at the last two, three weeks, trust is fundamentally broken. And we see that. But one of the very interesting data point is, even within the last two, three weeks, we are not seeing a whole lot of customers actually pause and go away from the conversations. That was surprising. That was actually a good news for the sector. Definitely there is a lot of doubt. We need to rebuild trust. But at the same time, we are not seeing institutions walk away completely from the space just yet. What about some of the funders of you? Of course, series D, you announced on social media, for example, 150 million came to you from backers such as Wellington Management, Tiger Global. Are those VC backers and crossover funds asking you, Raghu, for more details on your business? Are they asking for perhaps some over? I'm going to jump in here because I think Raghu's lost his ability to hear you. But Caroline's asking about your backers, some of your investors, what about them losing faith? Have your investors been phoning you and saying, what is going on? What is our exposure to FDX? Yeah, yeah. So there's a lot of investor conversations. Especially if you look at the roster of investors that were associated with FDX, these are some of the biggest names on the planet. As a result, there is definitely a lot of confusion in chaos in the early days within our investors as well. So we did spend a lot of time.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1974,2022-11-22 22:11:13
19361," These are some of the biggest names on the planet. As a result, there is definitely a lot of confusion in chaos in the early days within our investors as well. So we did spend a lot of time thinking this through with our investors in terms of our risk limits. We walked them through the balance sheet, our approach. The good news here is, Falcon X as a company we never take directional bets. And that was extremely powerful because the biggest learning out of the 2008 crisis and what eventually led to the vocal rule is, if market infrastructure companies start taking directional bets, the cascade amplification is going to be huge. And for that reason, when we started the company, we always were on the principle of never take directional bets. That is ultimately where the customer or investors got comfortable with. All right, Ragu, Yala Gada, CEO and co-founder of Falcon X. Thank you. Coming up, how economic uncertainty is affecting Zoom? This is other tech companies at Triming Costs. We'll talk all about that and more with Zoom's CFO. Kelly Steckelberg, next. This is Bluemdag. Let's talk about the shares of video conferencing players. Zoom, they dropped Tuesday after the company recorded its slowest sales growth on record. Now, a number of analysts were reacting to all of it and you've got the breakdown. Yeah, it's interesting. I mean, some analysts did cut price targets at one point on Tuesday, the stocks down more than 10%. We closed down almost 4%. But what was really interesting for me was Morgan Stanley, maintaining equal weight on the stock price target $85 a share. But they're saying that even though growth was better than expected, in other words, it did not slow down as much as feared, they can't get rid of this narrative around the stock. This bearish narrative about Zoom. You and I have been discussing Zoom for what feels like a very long time. But in reality, goes back to just the beginning of the pandemic, when this name became a household name, right? Still, really big underperformance year today. Zoom is one of the great laggards, right? Especially when we consider some of the names that you and I have tried.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1975,2022-11-22 22:15:47
19362," Year to date, Zoom is one of the great laggards, right? Especially when we consider some of the names that you and I have tracked so closely, down almost 60% year to date, a big question I've got. How do they return to growth? Now in this genuine post-pandemic period, Karate. Let's ask, women who knows it, Zoom CFO, Kelly Stackelberg, we're pleased to say, is with us. And talk to us, Kelly, just about the economic headwinds, macro as they are. How do you, as a company, navigate that? How do you return to growth with your smaller customers, in particular? Yeah, so we have two segments of our business. As you well know, we have the enterprise, which is supported by our direct organization, and we have the online portion of our business. And the enterprise segment is growing well. We had 20% year-over-year growth in Q3. And this is where we're seeing this transition from being a really, really killer meeting app that everyone knows and loves. As you say, we became known for during the pandemic to becoming a platform that really provides all of your collaboration and communication needs with Zoom phone, Zoom contact centers, Zoom 1, which is a bundle that brings them all together. The area that we are seeing headwinds is in our online segment of our business. And this is by its nature more international, so much more impacted by the strengthening dollar and the impact of FX that it's having, as well as the impact that we're seeing in Europe from the war. And then this is the area that we're seeing a little bit of macro as well. Some of these customers themselves being impacted by seeing contractions and thus returning to, you know, cost-cutting potential considerations. We have seen, churn in this segment of our business, return to pre-pandemic levels. It's down to 3.1%. But we are seeing some challenges, as I said, headwinds in the new ad, and that's what we're really focused on. And what we need to stabilize in order for it not to have that dampening effect on our long-term growth. Your long-term growth could M&A drive a part of that. I think you've talked about M&A in the past. So I guess my question to you is, how do you use M&A as a tool for growth? What kinds of companies will help you grow in those areas that are doing better? So what we've seen be successful for us in the past is acquiring companies that have technology that accelerate our building of those technologies. So for example, last year we acquired Solve, which brought conversational AI, which is a much needed capability into our Zoom context center product. We continue to look for opportunities like that, which accelerate our development. We also look for opportunities that could be a complement to us. So, you know, we recently announced at Zoom Topia that we have an email and calendar integration, also email and calendar services for SMB customers. And that's a perfect example of how we're continuing to extend into productivity tools and also a perfect opportunity to continue that expansion through possible M&A. Let's talk a little bit when there's M&A. There's also, let's talk about a focus on costs. And actually, Anna, we're impressed by that cost control. But how much are you having to depend and look at future costs of your labor in particular job cuts we're hearing from HP just in the last hour or so? So Zoom by our nature, we have always been a very frugal company. We had a very interesting situation that during the pandemic, our growth really outpaced our ability to hire and invest. And we've been very focused on the last couple of years of getting caught up. There were areas that we needed to invest in, especially R&D. We're very close now to reaching our long-term targets, which means we will think very thoughtfully about hiring and investing going forwards in areas that are focused on driving innovation, driving growth. But of course, we want to be insured that our expenses are not outpacing revenue and need to do that in a very measured way. And that is exactly the message that our leisure team is focused on, that our employees are focused on, especially as we're planning for FY 24. Kelly, I mentioned the stock move Tuesday. 1.10% all told, you know, paired some of those declines. But this was the slowest quarter of revenue growth you guys have recorded. How much pressure do you as a management team feel right now?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1976,2022-11-22 22:19:55
19363," for those declines. But this was the slowest quarter of revenue growth you guys have recorded. How much pressure do you as a management team feel right now? We always talk about this internally. What we can control is our own execution. And we are aligning our employees around continuing to focus on delivering on our customers' needs, on building out go-to-market infrastructure, where we need it for example, one of our focuses and initiatives is building out our partner ecosystem on an international basis. And keeping everybody focused on that, rather than the stock price, it is really the message. And that's what we can control on, so that's what we focus on in Zoom. What about control of the competition? And of course, innovation is to fend off some of that. Are you hearing from clients that they just have to cut and therefore they're going with teams? Or are you hearing that they cannot make the purchase that they estimated in this time? You know, we've been really pleased with our renewal rates, especially in the enterprise. As I think we are all convinced now that the flexible work is here to stay. And so organizations realize in order to keep their employees productive and happy, they need to provide them the proper technology, which includes Zoom meetings, Zoom phones, also ensuring that the proper technology is in the rooms. However, you know, they are being very thoughtful about those purchases. And so we have a very competitive and compelling total cost of ownership. Zoom one is a bundle that brings all of our most needed products together at a very compelling price point. And so what we do see is more scrutiny around deals, but understanding and showing how we can create value for customers makes Zoom a great alternative, even in these environments where my peer CFOs are being thoughtful, very, very thoughtful about, you know, commitments and investments for the future. All right, Zoom, CFO, Kelly, Steklberg, thank you for joining us here on Bloomberg Technology. Coming up, there's a new EV maker on the block, well, sort of. My conversation with Fisker, CEO, Henrik Fisker on the heels of the company, finally, starting production. This is Bloomberg.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1977,2022-11-22 22:24:39
19364," MUSIC EV Maker Fisker has finally started building its vehicles two years after going public. The ocean SUV just started rolling off assembly lines in Austria. It's targeting 40,000 units in year one and already has over 63,000 reservations. I caught up with Henrik Fisker, Chairman, CEO and founder of Fisker earlier today after he rang the bell at the MYSE. I think we actually, in my opinion, are at maybe just a height point of the recession. I don't think we're going into recession. I think we're in the middle of it and getting out of it. I can really feel that when we talk to our suppliers, they're getting people back into their facilities. We have had a rough time getting all our suppliers lined up. But we managed it, I think, together with Macna, Macna, of course, is a powerhouse in the automotive industry. We are taking a kind of cautious approach. We are only making 300 vehicles in Q1 next year, then jumping really fast up to 8,000. And the reason for the 300 is because we want to make sure all our suppliers come with us. We actually are seeing that our supply chain are very good. It's been tough, but they're there and they're with us. Henrik, small volume of vehicles then in Q1. Are these vehicles coming here to the United States? And how does the infrastructure look to service the early customers? How do they take delivery? What happens if the car has a servicing issue? So we have, first of all, our own technicians with mobile technicians, which we can send all over the US. We also have a deal with Bridgestone, which have more than 2,000 facilities all over the US. So we actually have more service facilities than even some of the largest automakers. So we have very well set up. We already have a couple of service centers, a special powertrain center in California. If there's any major issues, we can bring the vehicle there. But so far, the quality I've seen of these vehicles coming off the line in Macna is amazing. I've never seen anything like it. I've been over 30 years in this industry. And I feel really good about our product and the quality. That was Fiskers, Chairman, CEO and founder, Henrik Fiskers. I'm going to tell you, Caroline, I've been writing about that company for more than two years. And monthly, Henrik Fiskers would say, November 17th, that's when production will start 2022 into his credit. It did. And then the backlog of orders, the production that comes, is it actually going to start to be a true competitor, er,d? Yeah. It's impossible to say. Their model rights to outsource manufacturing to Macna, a contract manufacturer. And that's why they're so confident about how many they can build, about why they're able to make it so affordable. And, you know, you look on the screen there at those pictures, it's more in line with what Americans like. Bigger cars, right? But whether it'll be successful, it will hit those targets who knows. The world of EVs is tricky. Remind me of the price point? It's about $40,000 US dollars, which if you go on Tesla's website right now, for example, or a Rivian that's near it to 80,000, that's an astonishing price point to commit to. And that's what we kept asking him, or what about supply chains, what about input costs, what about semiconductors? He seems unfazed. Er, you always bring out the best in these people, particularly with the long-term relationships you have. So he seems like quite a character. I'm not sure what the whole glove thing was, though, whether you're round the bell. Did he tell you? Completely lost on me. It must be something to do with electrified, but... Magician vibes, Ed. Magician vibes. All right. Well, anyway, coming up more on the FTX fallout, and how much a setback this will be for the digital asset ecosystem. This is Bloomberg.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1978,2022-11-22 22:28:40

19366," In a number of respondents saying, yes, affirmatively, a will buy an iPhone at some point in the next 12 months is up. It's really interesting as well to look at some of the consumer behavior, especially the installed base age. In other words, that's a smart way of saying how long a consumer's holding onto their smartphones. It really crept up in the most recent survey to around 20 months. Imagine holding onto your smartphone for 20 months. But the reasons why are even more informative Caroline, why do people upgrade their iPhones? Because the battery is broken or the battery life is drained, because it's slow or simply because it's damaged. They don't seem motivated by upgrading to the latest handset because of the tech. Really interesting products watch this holiday season. I don't have to imagine 20 months, Ed. I live 20 months. I push past 20 months. But in fact, maybe I'm not going to buy any electronics this holiday season. In fact, we came to you. Our followers on Twitter, our audience, our engaged audience about what on holiday are you wanting? What's your shopping list? What's your Santa's list looking like? And actually, most people still want experiences. We're in this post-COVID life when we want to go out and enjoy ourselves. 35.5% of you saying that. 26% of healthy quarters think it's electronics is where they want their money to be being put to work. At parallel furnishings, we stocked up too much in COVID. And clearly, a few just want cold, hard cash or at least a gift version of that. I'm pleased to say they were ahead of holiday shopping. We want to get a sense of how people are spending. And whether they're being more thrifty or more thoughtful, Renee Morons with us, head of sustainability at eBay. And Renee, what you can give us is a really interesting take, particularly of where Gen Z are putting their money to work. Because I certainly started to rent more of my items, perhaps look for second hand. And is that more focused on money and a recession worry? Or is that more focused on sustainability in the here and now? You know, it's really both. I think that Reconverse is selling, and buying of used and pre-loved goods is really a dual issue. So people have the opportunity to get online, sell things they're laying around their house and make a profit, potentially an extra couple of dollars in their pocket as we head into the holiday season. But at the same time, they're helping the environment. Not only does this item get a second life and not go to landfill, but you're also helping to avoid additional carbon emissions being put in the air, which is really critical when we're in a time of a climate crisis. What are people selling right now? They're selling just about everything you mentioned that people wanted in this in the skip before. Electronics, apparel, handbags, sporting goods, whatever you can imagine. We have it all on eBay and people are really buying all those items. Because they are also contributing to the circular economy, it's a dual win. It's a win for your pocket and so went for the plan. Renee, eBay, story technology name. To some people, a blast from the past to be fair, but a lot of the data that I've read throughout Tuesday suggests actually there is a younger audience going to eBay in search of goods, selling goods. My question is why? Are they driven by cost consciousness? Are they driven not so much about cost consciousness or value for money? I want the bang for my buck. Talk us through the spending patterns you're seeing. With the Gen Z and millennials, they're not having the same stigma attached to buying used, buying a pre-legged item that maybe my generation did. They're seeing that there's money to be saved while you're participating online in the circular economy. But they're also having the added benefit of knowing that they're not contributing extra waste to the landfill. They're not contributing extra emissions to the atmosphere. And so that circularity of seeing used goods being sold and being bought online is really increasing. Over 50% of our survey participants said that they're selling more used goods online than they have in previous years. So we're seeing a real trend here. What are some of the weird and wonderful things people are buying? Like really weird, really wonderful. Really weird and wonderful. There is an old story floating around about somebody trying to think so. They're sold that that didn't really fly. So that got squashed pretty quickly. But the wonderful things are those unique finds. There's a teacup that your grandmother may have had in a set and it was broken. And then that one item is online. You were able to match it and bring it back and put it with the set that your grandmother had.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1980,2022-11-22 22:37:17
19367," That is an all-time high. So we think the infrastructure is working beautifully. As far as Coinbase, this is an onshore regulated company and wanting to help shape regulations. Brian Armstrong, the CEO and Alicia, CFO have been leaning into what's going on right now and saying, OK, regulators, we need more clarity in order to protect investors. Those who wanted to get involved with certain types of crypto were forced off shore and look at what's happened. So I think that Coinbase is going to come out here looking very, very strong. It just lost a very big competitor in ITX. What is the market missing, though, because that could be one narrative, Kathy, but at the same time, we haven't exactly seen shares of Coinbase rallies since FTX has collapsed. Do you think to you that represents potentially broader concern about just people's interest in crypto following FTX has collapsed? No, I think it's more fear. I think many people say we don't know what we don't know. And so what we do is we step back, put a little perspective into the situation here. And what do we have? So the entire crypto asset ecosystem is an $800 billion ecosystem. Apple is three times larger in terms of market cap. So that's some perspective. Many people are saying, well, OK, is this another Lehman? Could we see the domino effect here? I've just given you one reason why the banking system back in 0809, trillions and trillions of dollars. And it was the global banking system. Right now, we have, it seems, from FTX, five to 10 billion dollars in creditors, as FTX has filed bankruptcy, they will be making claims. If you look at Lehman, that was $1.2 trillion in claims. So again, just trying to put perspective, this is fraud. That was Ark Invest CEO, Kathy Wood. Coming up more on crypto, our lab's president, John Woo, discusses the crypto contagion and its impact on trust in the blockchain ecosystem. This is Bloomberg.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1981,2022-11-22 22:44:37
19368," Okay. Convention of the nietxisN щ just this week alone because FTX's attorney told a bankruptcy judge that a substantial amount of assets have been stolen or indeed are missing in what's been considered, quote, one of the most abrupt and difficult corporate collapses in the history of corporate America and that's according to the new CEO. Plus, Rume Bozler learnt that the Binance CEO of course CZ met with Middle East investors to raise money for his crypto recovery fund he's been talking about. And of course, we reported yesterday, Genesis warning potential investors it may have to file for bankruptcy unless it can raise new money while acknowledging there's a $2.8 billion in outstanding loans on its balance sheet including two related parties such as, well, it's a parent company, DCG. For more on the state of the industry, the person who's behind a lot of this breaking news is Shanali Basakshis with us and Avala perhaps, President John Woo, please to say is with us as well. And first and foremost, John, let's talk about how exhausted you are. What is it like the sentiment you're in the underlying technology? You're about getting new rails for financial, for traditional finance to run on in a more crypto, crypto, more underlying efficient technological manner. Are people being put off coming to you at the moment? A little bit. I would have to say there's definitely lack of trust now in the space. There were a lot of people who were already distrustful in the space to begin with and with all of these things that the drama that's happened in the last few months, they feel like they are going to equate that with the entire space. I'm in the middle. I see a lot of activity. I speak to all different types of partners, builders, exchanges, market makers. I can tell you it's actually really just a small percentage of these people. But the small percentage of people have a lot of control because they're in large centralized entities and these are the really the bad actors. Most people are good. Speaking of large and centralized, that news about FTX is not disclosing the names of the 50 creditors, the top 50. This is supposed to be an industry about trust. Is there a problem here to not know who those top 50 creditors are? As a crypto native, I generally believe in full transparency and disclosing everything. But in the situation we're in right now, I almost feel like not disclosing a name is actually good because it could create bank runs at some of these places that are still operating well. Talk to us, therefore, about what you worry in terms of contagion. You've talked about the lack of trust. You've talked about the worry of a lack of transparency. Everyone's now looking at the exchange they use or the tokens that some of the exchanges have, of course, issued themselves. Is contagion a zemo shoes to drop, do you think? So I think you guys are in a great job of covering genesis. In my seat, I actually think genesis is a bigger issue in terms of the capital markets of crypto than even FTX. Genesis with the largest lender out there, they've done unsecure as well as collateralized lending. There's really no one else doing that lending. Without them in the markets, all the people in the value chain, all the companies like market makers who need to borrow in order to do market making, you're going to see liquidity gets sapped out of the markets. Spreads widen. No investors want to come in and you have a vicious cycle. So genesis is a very important part of the crypto capital markets. And therefore, how much does it set it back if we do see a bankruptcy filing, for example, by such a juggernaut, such as genesis? Many, many years. We're going to need some white knight to come in, maybe a traditional finance player.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1982,2022-11-22 22:49:02
19369," Many, many years. We're going to need some white night to come in, maybe a traditional finance player who's dabbled in the space and is willing to come in and take some risk. If you look at a lot of things out there in terms of instruments that trade, there's clearly a different sentiment from the track fight community towards crypto versus the crypto native community. You can look at it the prices in terms of the futures curve, the CME futures curve is out months are really negative for Bitcoin and Ethereum, whereas the perpetuals in the crypto native markets which are also undated futures are flatter. So it's not backwardation like the CME. What do you think about trades like that? You look at that CME futures contract arbitrage, you look at what's happening with the great scale Bitcoin trust. These are financial assets like any other financial asset right now. Is it a good thinking opportunity or is it too risky to trade? It's an incredible arbitrage opportunity that you can make 25% on an annualized basis. But the issue really is you can't find a counterpart to help you put that trade on because nothing is flowing in the markets right now. The largest lender out there has a trickle ripple effect that everyone else is not lending. So if they're not lending, counterparties are not taking risk either. So the crypto market look like without that kind of leverage anymore. We go back to the previous cycle. We're talking about 2015 to 2018. Leverage needs to be controlled. Leverage is not bad in every economy and every marketplace. You need lending and borrowing to some extent. Otherwise you don't have money growth. And we need some of that back into this market to get the markets going again. I'm interested in this talk of a traditional finance giant maybe a kind of crossover investor who's dabbled already. Who could do that and have the will of the regulators, the will of well Washington on their side? Well, first of all, I think all the existing players, when this is all done, I think 80% of the companies in this current crypto capital markets will be gone. Now 20% are still around. They're going to have to take a leadership role. They're going to work. They need to work with regulators and come up with good regulation. Even if it's bad regulation, it's better than no regulation. And then you'll have perhaps banks come in to pick up the pieces and buy parts of the market structure because they'll be more comfortable and they'll inject a lot of liquidity. Or you have traditional market makers, whether it's Citadel coming in, they've dabbled in the city all securities or a James Street or well known I frequency funds who are very adept in this market. What about the traditional players here? We reported this morning, for example, Apollo is looking to list a digital asset strategy on a blockchain. You're doing something similar with a bunch of kind of parties, including KKR. So are they concerned, given the broader rhetoric around crypto? Because those tokens, your blockchain has a token as well. Everyone is a little concerned. I cannot say no one's concerned. But with that said, even at the capital markets in crypto are broken, the technology is still continuing. So Apollo's announcement of raising a fund using a tokenized version of that, all the labs, all the launch tokenizing part of a KKR fund really shows that the technology and the innovation is going to continue and the benefits will accrue to the people who are in the space. It's interesting. One of the conversations I had with Mike Cagney, who's the CEO, figure about this particular announcement, was that stablecoins could be an onboarding ramp for these private equity funds. Can that happen? Is there enough security in the stablecoin system as it exists today for it to be a feeder, essentially, into the traditional financial system in a bigger way? Well, yes, in terms of the security. And that's the ultimate benefit. When you have multi-parties that need to exchange information and payment simultaneously, that's the real benefits of a blockchain technology. So do you need that token in that sense, whether it's a stablecoin or a different token? That's the real benefits that you can provide to your cutting costs and creating more efficiency in existing financial systems. I don't know, let's not forget. It was just last week that the New York Fed was talking about digital dollar and pilots there.

19372," 500 human beings have ever left the bounds of Earth's atmosphere. But thanks to a set of ambitious private companies betting on the promise of space tourism, that long-awaited future could be here sooner than we think. For most of the history of spaceflight, governments have been the prime force behind nearly every aspect, from planning to funding to cruise selection. But as early as the 1980s, proposals for commercial space tourism began to emerge, along with innovative solutions for getting people there, such as the wild concept of sticking a 74-person passenger cabin in the cargo bay of a NASA space shuttle. Although various non-astronauts have been selected for missions over the years, cruise space tourism didn't happen until 2001. When an entrepreneur named Dennis Tito coughed up an estimated $20 million to hitch a ride with the Russian Federal Space Agency, for a week-long vacation aboard the International Space Station. 20 years later, we're seeing a new contender in this final frontier of tourism. Private companies. It's becoming a private enterprise situation, still very high risk with the high reward, a potential reward. But you know, government is really out of the business of flying people now, and it's really going to be companies like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos and Richard Branson that do that heavy lifting. Commercial space tourism is usually about taking the non-astronaut, the private citizen into an orbital or suborbital flight. So you get a short amount of microgravity experience and you can float and take some photos. And then you come back. This was something that technology had gotten to a point where the private sector was going to make a business out of this. There are multiple companies that want to get to the place where they fly people into space. The first of these is Blue Origin, founded in 2000 by Jeff Bezos. Using the autonomous rocket system New Shepherd, a tribute to the first American in space, Blue Origin plans to launch up to six passengers at a time, offering a rarefied treat of 62 mile high views and a momentary experience of weightlessness. Boking officially kicked off in May 2021, with the very first C to be auctioned off for charity. Meanwhile, Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic has also been pursuing a viable form of suborbital tourism. Aiming for a launch in 2022, once Sir Richard himself has taken flight. I'm hoping to be able to go to space. I'd love to be able to coincide it with the moon landing and go to space. So I've got the whip on the team and we'll see how we go. The company claims to have lined up over 600 seat reservations so far, including Justin Bieber and Leonardo DiCaprio. Virgin has projected that the final cost of the ticket will be at least $250,000 or roughly $50,000 for each of the five minutes or sub-weightlessness that you'll get to experience. Although costly both companies' offerings aim to make suborbital flight a regular form of adventure travel, eventually driving down costs at scale to expand the customer base beyond the orbit of celebrities and billionaires. The third major contender is Elon Musk's SpaceX, which has set its sights even higher on orbital flights, which are a whole nother level of complexity and energy and danger. When you go suborbital, if you're just going to go up above the von Karman line, which is 100 kilometers, or about 62 miles, you only need to get up to maybe 5,000 miles an hour to get up there and you go basically straight up and then straight back down. You don't have the re-entry heating that you would see coming in from an orbital. So when you go orbital, I don't care if you're a baseball or a battleship, you've got to go 17,500 miles per hour, not just 5,000 miles an hour. The energy is involved are much greater. By doing that, SpaceX has gone another level up and that's what they're doing with the Inspiration4. Visit Inspiration4.com for your chance to go to space. Inspiration4 is the first planned all civilian mission into orbit, slated to launch in late 2021. The crew will bring their own set of diverse perspectives and backgrounds and experiences to test how a group of different people, namely people who aren't professional astronauts, could affair in space. Until now, astronauts have had to be physically perfect and this mission is changing that. And so I feel incredibly honored to be representing those who aren't physically.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1986,2022-11-22 23:06:10
19373," Until now, astronauts have had to be physically perfect, and this mission is changing that, and so I feel incredibly honored to be representing those who aren't physically perfect. At H10, I was diagnosed with bone cancer, and I was treated at St.G. Children's Research Hospital, and I spent a year there undergoing intense chemo and also surgery that ultimately saved my leg. I now work at St. Jude as a PA, a physician assistant, and I work with leukemia and lymphoma patients. The kids we work with are so brave, and they are very excited to watch me go to space, because this is showing them that they're capable of doing this as well. Haley, along with three other crew members, will spend three days in space orbiting the Earth every 90 minutes, for landing back off the coast of Florida. Well, when you think about access, the first astronauts for the United States came from the test pilot side, and so women weren't allowed to be a part of that. We have somebody in their 20s, somebody in their 30s, somebody in 40s, and somebody in their 50s, and so there can be access in all kinds of way, whether you're talking about age, whether you're talking about gender, whether you're talking about race and ethnicity, and all of those things. The first time people are going up into space and not sent there by super power, like the United States or Russia or China, well that's like really significant, and you've got to be very thoughtful about it. The whole game plan right now is to make space really affordable, and accessible for everybody, so you can have fishing buddies going to space someday, but the first is special. With that, we wanted to have a crew selection process that could make space available to everyday people. Getting to space is only the first step for space tourism. The next challenge is what to do and where to stay when you get there. Axiom space is planning to launch the first segment of a new commercial space station in 2024. Their $2 billion project called AxStation would become the first free-flying private international space station, or to use a more consumer-friendly term, a space hotel. Axiom isn't the only company out to make your space stay a little more comfortable. Big low aerospace has been building what they call expandable habitat technology, like their B330, an inflatable pod module that expands once in orbit. There's even one attached to the national space station right now they've been testing it, and you take it up and it's rather small, and then you inflate it, and it seems to be working very, very well. This is likely to be the first kind of tourist hotel that you're going to see up in space. First of all, it's easy to carry, instead of this giant tin can with all of that. The inflatable are lighter, you can just blow them up and they get a nice big size for about less than half the weight probably. But even as space missions become accessible to civilians, the risks of going to space are incredibly high, and you could die a thousand ways that we can think of in a thousand other ways that we can't think of. This is Michelle Hanlon. She's a space lawyer at the Mississippi School of Law focused on protecting humans in outer space. Now I'm not in the turning for any of the space tours, so I haven't been privy to their private contracts, but I can tell you that the FAA requires certain waivers to be in those contracts. So for example, the FAA says, well, we're not going to make you make your spacecraft to a certain safety level. We are going to make you spacecraft operator. Make sure that you inform your space tours of all of that hazards that you know of. I imagine a very long waiver all the ways you can die in space. And you have to understand that there's health risks and you have to indemnify the US government if you are launching from the United States. So those are things that we know a space tourist has to sign and has to wait. So now let's go back and think about our space flight participants. The FAA calls space tours space flight participants. They don't call them astronauts. Why is that important? If you're not an astronaut, there's no obligation to rescue you if something goes wrong. It's a lot of money to set up a rescue launch. If it can even be done, it's something really important to think about and that difference as we cross this threshold from having astronauts in space to having real people like me in space. And when we are able to make",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1987,2022-11-22 23:10:31
19374," as we cross this threshold from having astronauts in space to having real people like me in space. And when we are able to make it to space reliably enough, there's still a host of other legal and ethical issues to consider before space tourism can truly take off. There are so many gaps in space law that we are going to have to put in a lot of sort of basement ideas. And so for example, the outer space treaty is a treaty that offers principles and guidelines for state activities, for the activities of national governments. Doesn't talk about private entities, doesn't talk about humans in space. So now if something goes wrong, so let's think about all the times hotels on Earth are sued, right? So slip and false. You step on something in the bathroom, you sue the hotel and it becomes a private lawsuit. Because of the vagaries of international law, if something happens in space, well boy, you can sue the state that launched your spacecraft, you can sue the company that brought you there, you can sue the hotel, you can sue the individual, you can sue every government related to that because the way the outer space treaty and the outer space regime have set this up is that anything that happens in space first has to go through a diplomatic channel before you think about suing an accordive law. And so every single slip and fall in a space hotel is a diplomatic nightmare. And so we really need to figure that out before we start sending a lot of people there. You think about human rights in space. Here we don't think about a human rights oxygen because it's kind of all around us and free. It's not in a space hotel. So what happens if something happens in the oxygen depletes? Who gets the oxygen first? And then of course, let's not even think about the labor. How do you treat your labor in a space hotel where that person may be there two or three years without coming back to Earth? So a lot of things to think about. Space habitats are more likely in the near future to focus on research missions and be a home for experiments that can't happen as easily back on Earth. Space hotels, I think they garner a lot of headlines and a lot of news, but at the same time, that's not the first thing that you're going to see happen. They don't offer the compelling business case. I think that you'll see from a place that wants to manufacture pharmaceuticals or a new type of crystal or some type of filament or fiber optic cables and other things that you can do in microgravity. The things that are actually high value finished good when you get that back to Earth and you sell it for a very, very huge profit margin. That's what's likely to happen in space as opposed to having a real estate platform that you sell to a tourist at space hotel. It's really interesting and it will probably happen, but it's not likely to be at the forefront of space commerce. Even if space hotels are right around the corner, don't get too excited about booking a trip in one. It's not a cheap ticket to ride to space and it's going to be millionaires and billionaires and that sort. But at the same time, the point was made that in the early days of airline trips, that was also a completely unaffordable ticket for most people. Those people who flew were people of means and over time it becomes affordable to the masses. I think that's the goal for all the entrepreneurs in space as well to get those costs down to a point where it's not $10 million or $5 million or $300,000 right into sub-orbital space. When it becomes more like buying a first-class ticket to go to Europe from the United States. So that's the goal and the question is, can we get to that point? Given the immense operating costs of getting to space, it may be years, if ever, until space tours and becomes a profitable venture for any of these companies. Virgin Galactic, the only publicly traded company of the three, has had a particularly rocky year, initially riding on the momentum of a SPAC deal. But more recently beset by launch delays and major funders including Branson himself, selling large quantities of their stock in the company. Space is really, really, really hard and it's an absolutely shay, but it's one that happens to be very true. It's just really hard to do. That's also the reason that you've seen the delays that Virgin had talked about flying years and years ago. And it became such a crazy point that Richard Branson actually...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1988,2022-11-22 23:14:52
19375," years and years ago and it became such a crazy point that Richard Branson actually stopped talking about it when he was asked because it was never going to be when he predicted. But it's not insurmountable and you know investors have stepped up because this is something that is doable. Despite the astronomical dangers and costs of getting to space, it may ultimately follow the course of other once fanciful modes of travel. My brothers having you know what was by modern standards a very unimpressive first flight you know at Kitty Hawk, I mean you had like less than 20 years later you had your first airborne ambulances being used to save lives. Fundamentally the world is a more interesting place when people can go and dance among the stars and such. The lure of space is in a it's in our DNA. It's that exploration bug. We are an exploratory species and we want to go out there and see what's out there. The vision that I had in 1969 of seeing normal human beings travel into space it's finally beginning to happen. When you get a bunch of people up there and they can all see it for themselves that will create even yet another revolution in how we treat our planet and what we think about. So while 2001 came and went without quite looking like Stanley Kubrick's ultimate space fantasy 2021 might finally be the year we're catching up. Alright. If you visit California, you might be inclined to go to Disneyland. Or jump in your convertible and take Highway 1 up the coast. We may be making pilgrimage to Yosemite. Oh, very fine choices. But if you're the kind of person who revels in our planet's extremes, then it's Route 395 than you're after. This one glorious road will carry you from Death Valley's desert floor to sky high views of Mount Whitney. You can see the 5,000-year-old bristle cone pines, the oldest living organisms.

Sometimes I'm known as 395 North because this is my Instagram account and I don't like to be known as that but I'm trying to use it to set a good example and do more with it than just social media. We had a cab and we got here in LA last time. I wanted to do it for sure where we are. This is BLM Land on the outskirts of National Forest and it's one of my favorite places in the world. Basically everything outdoors wrapped into one. We have so much National Forest in public land that you can literally just cruise out and find a place to camp. It's ours. What I wish was mine is Jan's sweet truck. It's a 2019 Ford Ranger. It has about 200 watts of solar in it and a fridge and has everything that an RV has except for a toilet. But just a smaller simple scale. You drive us around day to day in LA and then just roll out when you want. It's my daily driver. Handles great and then when I'm done with work I can just bail and go camping. So the camper basically has only what I need. Think of it as backpacking with a car. The fridge has a couple compartments. This is just a kitchen box. Stove utensils and a bunch of stuff. This one has just dry food. Then when you get inside there's a bed. The bed flips up so you've got tons of room in here. Miss Hauling. Miss phenomenon. If you want to pull that over. Let me just pop that out. So home on wheels. Yeah, this is my vacation house. Yeah, it's so nice man. Even with his nomad lifestyle, Jan faces the same big question as the rest of us. Through the internet and smartphones have to ruin everything. When you find the super special beautiful spots is that you bust out a map and like looking where it might be cool to go or is it worth a mouth and just getting to know people of the locals. If I see a dirt road, I just want to go down. So a lot of it's just aimless rambling. It's a desire to just see something. Check that out.

After we split up from Jan and continued on our way, smoke started to envelop us. The plus side was that our RV no longer smelled like feet. The downside was breathing. My man David here suggested that we try and outflank the smoke by cutting through your semity. Without a reservation, we had to talk our way in. Yes, no stopping, no getting out. No problem. We just wanted to get through. It was a beautiful choice. We got out of the smoke. But not quite as effective as we had hoped. Just four or four hours or so, and we had managed to trade the smoky majesty of your semity for the smoky... Look at it. Strip malls of the Central Valley. We have made it sort of out of the smoke all the way across your Semity National Park and here to the gorgeous Central Valley of California. We're off to see a kind of surprising tech startup that is making some pretty strange machines to serve all the growers out in this region.

The Central Valley stretches out over about 20,000 square miles, and the farmers here produce about one-fourth of the food that Americans eat. We're doing a whole lot of fruits and nuts. Tell me a little bit of the background of God's. I know some of this is like a family business. The roots of this go back a ways. Tell me kind of like how we got to what's essentially like a startup I guess. Yeah, definitely. So the founder of our company is Dave Crinklaw, and he started the business back in 1982.

19378," Actually like a startup I guess. Yeah definitely. So the founder of our company is Dave Crinklaw and he started the business back in 1982. He started with his basically with his dad was commercial spraying of trees and vineyards. Got to the point where our biggest challenge was labor. Just the shortage of it really. He was forced into innovating and he had had this idea for quite some time about doing a driverless sprayer and it finally got to the point where he said you know what I either got to get out of this business or I'm going to innovate. Organic or not crops need to be sprayed and this process has to take place a few times a year. This means hiring a lot of people to work long hours under serious pressure. And so just like the tech bros to the north, Gus decided to solve all of its problems with robots. On this like labor points, you guys have set this up where you can have somebody in a truck and that one person can monitor I think like eight of these. In order to operate Gus you have one guy or girl that sits in a pickup and they monitor from a laptop computer. So that person is basically just watching all the vehicles on the screen. They can monitor up to eight of them at a time while they're out there spraying and orchard. And so that user interface really provides them with all the information they need to make sure that the machines are safe and that they're doing the correct job. So it tells them what speed they're driving, the engine RPM, the amount of gallonage per acre that they're applying at any given time. So if any one of the machines has an issue, it's going to send an alert to that laptop. Much like a self-driving car, these beasts use GPS, LiDAR and cameras to see and navigate the world around them. They also rely on pre-built maps of the orchards for extra guidance. Gus builds the machines right here and then takes them out for robot training on this orchard next door. It's here that the company learns if the machines will behave and do as their software and human masters command. So this is a kind of like that. This is a test orchard where you guys put it through the pace and it doesn't work on the technology. Yeah, so this is our test orchard right here. It's right by our building. You can see in the background. So every new machine as it comes off the assembly line, it's put through a commissioning test right here. We test all the sensors on the machine, autonomous computer, all the safety systems, make sure it's doing what it's doing, fire it when it's delivered to a customer. So what's it doing now? So right now he's doing a test spray. So he's just turning the water on to make sure that the system comes up to pressure. Spraying water out of the nozzle is just to make sure it's all functioning properly. Okay. It's got like a crazy turbine at the backer. Yeah, so it's basically just a big fan. Okay. And that fan's driven off of the Cummins diesel motor and it just basically creates a big air flow. Gus is already selling these vehicles to brave modern farmers and people the world over have taken notice of its machines. And have you just sold them in the Central Valley or like throughout the US or even overseas or where they go? Yeah, so right now the majority of our machines are here in California in the Central Valley. However, we do have machines and customers in Florida and the Citrus industry over there as well as Australia. And I think you start selling them like December of 2019? Yeah, so we started taking orders early last year for the sprayers and the first delivery we made were in December of 2019. Okay. And how much do they cost each? So our retail price on these machines is $285,000. So it's like it's not a small investment, but I'm sure the regular sprayers aren't. Yeah, I mean we're honestly not too far away from conventional equipment on our price. And the main thing is that the return on investment is very, very quick due to all the labor savings and the increased efficiency. I mean these machines, they just drive. But basically what we're doing besides this machine, this is our first machine we call it orchard gas, mainly designed for your nut trees as well as.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1992,2022-11-22 23:32:12
19379," But basically what we're doing besides this machine, this is our first machine we call it orchard gas mainly designed for your nut trees as well as citrus and fruit. In the future we're working on a few other projects. We're going to do more machines. One of them is actually a vineyard sprayer so vineyards are much tighter spacing so the machine has to be physically smaller and then we've got our eyes on doing a lot of other renovating. That right there friends is a central valley farmer putting his whole fruit basket on the table. Gary's Ted Tot can't be far off. And with that it was time to get back in the RV. And to confront what happens when three men are bested by their own failings. And the forces of entropy. Next on Hello World we cruise into the Mojave Desert in search of a lunar lander. We have instruments that we are going to deliver to the South Pole of the Moon in December of 2022. Things that are trying to scan the surface of the moon. And hang with a test pilot who walked away from this. She lives by herself but for the last few months she hasn't been alone. This technology isn't made for 93 year olds but this woman is making sure that this particular robot is. She's researching the way we interact with machines and if she has her way robots will soon be a trusty companion for all of us. How can I help you? It's technology replaces old jobs. It's also creating new ones. I'm Aki Ito and I'm here to show you the jobs of the future. My name is Danielle Ishak and I am a human robot interaction researcher. It's really hard to intuitively design a robot meant for a consumer audience. You have to make sure that it's a robot that people want. People know how to use and people value. Danielle works for an Israeli startup called Intuition Robotics. Its US office is here in downtown San Francisco. The company is funded by a couple big names like Samsung and Toyota. Global disclosure, Bloomberg's venture capital arm is an investor too. This is Ellie Q. Can I do a grout for a spin? Please? Ellie Q. Tell me what you can do. I am a proactive social robot designed for older adults. I can connect you to your family and friends and even play music. These features might remind you of the Amazon Echo. But you'd be missing the point if you compared her to a smart speaker. She's not meant to just be useful. She's meant to be a...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1993,2022-11-22 23:36:32
19380," But you'd be missing the point if you compared her to a smart speaker. She's not meant to just be useful. She's meant to be a companion. Why don't you take a break and have a drink? And that's why she has a head that can nod and make other subtle gestures you might expect from a pet. Through our research with older adults, we're finding that almost on a daily basis, we see that somebody tells her that they love her. Or that they like her. Or that they miss her. But really, I love you. They'll also tell her I'm depressed or I'm lonely. They'll open up to her in a way that they might not necessarily open up to a human because they don't feel like they'll be judged. Ellie Q is an on sale yet. But a prototype is already in the homes of about a dozen early testers who live in the Bay Area. Ellie Q, tell me what the weather is today. Danielle's job is to figure out what's working and what's not. Sorry, please rephrase your request. And she does that by visiting each of her testers twice a month. How important are these visits to your job? They're critical. We're building a product for people who we are not. I'm not a senior. And how could you know how to design for somebody if you don't do research? Because otherwise, you would just be designing in the dark. Jobs like Danielle's are just starting to emerge. Until recently, robots were mostly in factories, separated from humans. But now, they're finally getting cheap enough, small enough, and smart enough to be in our homes. This has created a whole new challenge of designing robots that people will actually want to interact with. And that's where Danielle comes in. Her research has helped shape every little facet of Ellie Q. From the way Ellie Q moves to the way she talks. It's a very special job, and it could be really hard, and it could be really frustrating about that end of the day. It's incredibly rewarding. And I think the most rewarding part about it is when I see the joy on the user's faces. Like, that they saw their feedback turned into something real. Today, we've driven east of San Francisco to go see one of Danielle's research participants. Ellie Q, tell me something interesting. Did you know that Ronald Reagan was a lifeguard in high school and saved 77 people's lives? Now, see, this is where a conversation is. She should open up, and I should say, no, I did not know that. I expect her to be able to continue a conversation for at least a couple of comments. Yeah. And why is that? Why? Because that's companionship. When Betty was around Danielle's age, she was working with some of history's very first computers. When I was finishing up my master's degree, I was working at Harvard in the computer lab when they were building Mark IV. A large room-sized computer. But now, this artificial intelligence stuff is amazing. Ellie Q, schedule a doctor's appointment. No problem. I'm working on it. When Danielle brought along the idea of working with robotics for the elderly, I said, are you kidding me? Will older people connect to a robot? And she said, I don't know. Let's research and find out. Danielle grew up here in this suburb of Atlanta. Her parents spent much of their childhoods in Israel and met in the US.

19381," in this suburb of Atlanta. Her parents spent much of their childhoods in Israel and met in the US. We as immigrants, we understood that we might need to work a little harder. In fact, I feel that rather than taking away from Danielle, it gave her so much more because she understood the fact that you need to run after your dreams and work really hard, no matter what the challenges are. School didn't come easily for Danielle. I have dyslexia and that very much affected my self-esteem academically. The principal of the school did not recommend her to take the Drens classes. She fought for it and she got into it and she did very well with them too. Danielle's first job out of grad school was at X. The secretive research facility founded by Google. It's known for dreaming about kinds of wacky, far-flung ideas. Can you tell us about the moonshine how to work done? No, I can't tell you too much about the projects that I work done. I can't say that I was working on robotics. She loved the job, but wanted to work on something that would reach real consumers sooner. So she left X after a year and joined intuition robotics. She's been working in the field for four years now and it took her a while to find her footing in a male-dominated industry. I've gone to different meetups where they'll be like a circle of men with their zip up jacket with their company logo on it and a beer in their hand. And I'll come in with lipstick and nobody wants to talk to me. This is my closet. So at first she did her best to fit in, wearing a pair of glasses she didn't need and toning down her style. So what's the kind of thing you used to wear to a conference? Stuff like this, blousey things. That make you look like you're 40. But that got old after a while. And what's the kind of thing you wear now? Now it's like I just enjoy being kind of expressive and playful and what I wear. Before we wrap up for the day, Danielle has one more LEQ tester to visit. Joseph is 97. And he's had the robot in his home for eight months. How are you? I'm fine. How are you? Good. How has Miss Ellie Cuban? She always tells me to take a drink of water. At least four times a day. So we added a whole bunch of new facts to LEQ. Did you know that a cup of chopped red bell pepper contains more vitamin C than an orange? Okay. What did you think of that? Certainly the print was, I could see that quite clearly. What about this? Well, I can see that. Now the cue, play music. No problem. It will begin shortly. By 2050, almost half a billion people are going to be 80 or older. And if current trends continue, more and more are going to be like Joseph and Betty, living alone. LEQ, stop. Today, both of them are doing okay. But some of Danielle's other participants have been struggling. Is it kind of hard to leave them at the end of the day? It is. Some of our testers are pretty advanced.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1995,2022-11-22 23:45:12
19382," Is it kind of hard to leave them at the end of the day? It is. Some of our testers are pretty advanced in the stages of depression through loneliness and isolation. And at times I know that LQ is cheering them up in their day, but I know that it's only part of the way. No source of artificial intelligence robots will ever be able to replace humans and human companionship or human care. The key to Danielle's work is to embrace that very limitation of machines. Robots should help humans do what they love, help humans interact with more humans, help humans in general. Not pull humans away from humans, not take humans jobs, leave humans without purpose. Whether it's in our workplaces or in our homes, robots are soon going to be everywhere. And it's up to Danielle to make sure this robot-filled future leaves us just a little better off. So don't be afraid. And if you are afraid, come and join us. Because I promise it's a friendly place.

Kids content on YouTube is huge. Views for videos can reach into the billions. Five of the top 10 videos in all of YouTube's history are either music videos or kids videos, with baby shark having more views than people on the planet. YouTube has created a revolution, not an evolution, in the way kids and families consume video content, and that extends then into how they view toys and play and all of the associated things that go with that. Kids YouTube for the unaware can be adorable. It can be boring. It can also just be flat out strange. But often it involves toys. And for toy makers who embrace the platform, it led to record success. I think LOS surprised Uncle Sherry's the biggest phenomenon that has ever happened in toy industry. This is the story of how YouTube changed kids toys. Play patterns, the way children play is timeless. But how we deliver on those play patterns through product and how we market that to children has changed quite a bit over the years. And I would say that the last five to ten years really ranks right up there with the 1950s when TV commercials directed to children, this first launched by...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1996,2022-11-22 23:49:31
19383," Ten years really ranks right up there with the 1950s when TV commercials directed to children this first launched by Mattel. This is Nancy's Wears. She led the Barbie brand during the 90s and spent four years as the chief marketing officer for Spin Master. It used to be that there would be a few play things that parents would bring into the home where that children would create themselves like a stick and a ball becomes a play thing. And the industry was at a certain level of volume at that point. Mattel was very innovative and actually put the first product on TV and advertised it to children. Let's play home. This created a huge explosion in the toy industry that unfolded across decades. When you're ready to play, everyone knows it's Lynx. When you go back to the 1980s, what do you think of in terms of head shows? You think of things like Masters as a universe. You think of the original Transformers and Care Bears. The joke was they were 22-minute commercials. Just close your eyes and care. Let's make a TV show which is really promotion for our popular IP to help sell toys. They were a lot of those famous characters in which kids absolutely loved it. They were totally entertained but there were huge toy lines behind them. This is Jim Silver, a 37-year veteran of the toys industry. In 1999, he started a consumer toy review magazine called Toy Wishes. And now he's the CEO of an influencer talent management group, TTPM. Regulations changed through the years and also parents became aware that they were purely commercials. And you saw a lot of the new channels, the Disney Channel and Nickelodeon. They realized that wouldn't work anymore. And to them, entertainment came before licensing. What happened over time was that toys started to become designed for a 32nd commercial. Closed at some mild amount of toolbox. Open at some MicroMachine USA. Cruiser Mini MicroMachine vehicles, planes and post to the police station, the Mini Motorcycle Repair Shop, the gas station, the construction office, work the rear working drawbridge, highway, passenger rap and garage doors. So if you couldn't explain it in a 32nd commercial, cost reduce it out of the product and just stick with what you could say. And features of toys, magical features using electronics, lights and sounds and mechanical movements that magic, like they don't know how it happens, that became more and more important. The sound of power is heard. See ya, Batman. That man's turbo powered, that mobile flies into high gear. Since 2000, with cable channels dedicated to kids, Disney Channel, Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network, there became the opportunity to reach kids in mass numbers every day of the week. And so the toy industry has continued to grow. The toy industry, for the most part, was a pretty solid business. Just growing a couple of percent a year here and there. There'd be big, big years here and there when there was maybe a hit movie, like a Star Wars movie come out, you know, drive a lot of toy sales. In 2014 to 2019, the global toy industry would grow by 15%. At about the same time, those major cable networks of Nickelodeon, Disney Channel and Cartoon Network would lose half their total audience. 2017 also saw the bankruptcy of Toys R Us, as both parents and kids discovered and bought more toys online. If you think about kids, they're usually the first adopters of a new medium. Kids weren't watching things like Nickelodeon as much as they used to. They were watching things on YouTube. YouTube started in early 2005. And this was like, you know, the very early web 2.0 this beginning of sort of like what with the time was going to be your generated content. Web blogging was really big. My space was the biggest thing on the internet back then.

19384," Big my space was the biggest thing on the internet back then. There was an early video of a Brazilian soccer legend doing stunt tricks that just When it's exploded on the site one of the first viral videos lazy Sunday if you remember that snl short Remember those earliest viral hits YouTube in the early days was definitely Comedy and I'm used it. It was a place of experimentation. I was the chief audience officer at maker studios I oversaw Essentially the creator partnerships and all over the world Maker studios was one of the largest multi-channel networks on YouTube and had partnered with some of the biggest YouTube channels of the time before being sold to Disney in 2014 Chris is now the CEO of Pocketwatch Which represents some of the largest kids stars on YouTube including Ryan's world and love Diana who can amass over a couple billion views every month The truth is one of the very biggest and earliest videos on all of YouTube is by a creator and star named I justine where she unboxed her first mobile phone bill for her brand new iPhone and it came in a box and And this ultimately morphed into many different formats associated with unboxing and tech was actually really big and those became fairly successful I'm pretty early on on the platform and You know you saw them expand from Tech products to beauty products and then around 2012 and 2013 who's on this explosion in the toys So here's the Furby inside right here We used to call them hands channels Okay, and a hands channel was literally a top-down view of Someone's hands unboxing typically a toy and they'd unbox it. They'd show each component We just got Uncle Scrooge. I would speak to many of those creators We signed many of those creators at Maker Studios to be our partners and It was it was fascinating in that it was this whole new genre and this home new format and that corresponded with a rise of kids and family viewership on YouTube that was stuck that was hard to miss and You would see it in the data and we had access to a lot of data in Maker Studios around YouTube Let's see what's inside First up we have the storm super pig you saw the launch of EvanTube who I consider the first child so to speak unboxing star and They would open toys and kids were just mesmerized by it. They loved watching it and next thing you know You had literally 50 unboxings. They were unboxing just about every toy You know it was and people were just really excited you open the toy and you see a toy Pop out and kids just got excited seated piece by piece. Yeah, he's he's in a bathroom. We're in a he's eating a lobster You know the early days of these unboxing videos the videos were you know from a doll's perspective just terrible I mean they were ten minutes long they were boring. They're it was a shaky camera. There was absolutely no production value And if you think about these executives, you know, they're they're trying to figure out how to reach this new audience And they're they're brought these videos and say we'll look at this video. It has 200,000 views on it and it's terrible when I first heard of it I thought it was the weirdest thing and just seemed kind of bizarre who would want to watch someone opening a toy Taking it out of the box, but then when I started thinking about this idea of exploration and discovery as a core play pattern The most fundamental play pattern there is it started to make sense and I think that I have to say that the company that that really jumped on that in the most Concerted way was MGA with their launch of LOL LOL surprise had three key elements Doll play which is you know, basically the most popular play pattern there is collectible So within each LOL surprise you get a little sheep that showed you all the other dolls you could play",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1998,2022-11-22 23:58:14
