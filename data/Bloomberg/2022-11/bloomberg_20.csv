18073," Many of those creators at Maker Studios to be our partners. And it was fascinating in that it was this whole new genre and this whole new format. And that corresponded with a rise of kids and family viewership on YouTube that was stuck, that was hard to miss. And you would see it in the data. And we had access to a lot of data in Maker Studios around YouTube. Let's see what's inside. First up, we had the storm super pig. You saw the launch of EvanTube, who I consider the first child, so to speak, unboxing star. And they would open toys. And kids would just mesmerize by it. They loved watching it. And next thing you know, you had literally 50 unboxings. They were unboxing just about every toy. You know, it was, and people were just really excited. Did you open the toy and you see a toy pop out? And kids just got excited, see the piece by piece. Yeah, he's in a bathroom. We're in a, he's eating a lobster. You know, the early days of these unboxing videos, the videos were, you know, from a doll's perspective, just terrible. I mean, there were 10 minutes long. They were boring. It was a shaky camera. There was absolutely no production value. And if you think about these executives, you know, they're trying to figure out how to reach this new audience. And they're brought these videos and say, we'll look at this video. It has 200,000 views on it. And it's terrible. When I first heard of it, I thought it was the weirdest thing. It just seemed kind of bizarre. Who would want to watch someone opening a toy, taking it out of the box? But then when I started thinking about this idea of exploration and discovery as a core play pattern, the most fundamental play pattern there is, it started to make sense. And I think that I have to say that the company that really jumped on that in the most conserved way was MGA with their launch of LOL. Oh, oh, oh, oh, surprise! LOL surprise had three key elements, doll play, which is, you know, basically the most popular play pattern there is collectible. So within each LOL surprise, you'd get a little sheet that showed you all the other dolls you collect. And then the surprise factor. You don't know which doll you were getting. It was a blind pack, as they call it. And LOL was made by this company called MGA. Back then, you know, 2016, they were a small player of the toy industry, founded by this guy named Isaac Larian. He's the CEO and founder. I have three adult kids, and they were making fun of me that, oh, you're old, you don't know anything about what's happening in today's sink. And I said, like what? And they said, for example, do you know about this iPhone unboxing videos that get millions and millions of views? So I thought they're pulling my leg. Children do to make fun of their parents. And then I did go and look one night. And I was frankly shocked and flabbergasted that, why would anybody buy an iPhone, take it home, and open the box and show it on the camera? And everybody would go and watch it. So I typed toy on boxing. And my God, I saw so many different videos and people, kids and adults might toys like an apple and unboxing it and video and posting it. So that gave me an idea that why not come up with the ultimate, and that's the first LOL surprise. All right, oh, yes, we've got a goal ball. LOL changed the way you open with toys. And everybody saw that. And the packaging became part of the play, which became part of the entertainment. So normally, if you get a package that you just open a package you take the toy out, that's not exciting. You open up LOL, you peel it away, you open up inside, you have seven surprises. And it took off like wildfire. And quickly became the top toy in the country. By December of 2018, eight of the top 10 toys sold were all LOL surprise brand. And according to MGA from 2016 to 2020, LOL would generate over $10 billion in retail sales worldwide. No, LOL was bigger than...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,687,2022-11-19 00:01:02
18074," surprise brand. And according to MGA from 2016 to 2020, LOL would generate over $10 billion in retail sales worldwide. You know, LOL is bigger than Star Wars. It's bigger than marble. It's bigger than Barbie. These brands with huge advertising budgets are known basically by everyone. You don't have to, you know, figure out what marble our Star Wars is. And LOL eclips them all. In the toy world, blind bag or blind box toys have been growing in popularity. The most famous example in recent years is Pokemon cards. Where you open packs in hopes of getting a Charizard, but more often wind up with something common like Blagar here. Two years before the launch of LOL in 2014, the Australian toy company Moose Toys launched a blind bag collectible called Shopkins. And in 2016, Spin Master would launch a more expensive blind box toy it called Hatchimals. But the thing that sets LOL surprise apart is that it mainly focused on YouTube. And not putting ads on YouTube, but working with creators and influencers to get their products in the hands of these kids doing the unboxing videos. For MGA, actually, the move towards YouTube was kind of a bit lucky and almost out of necessity. In late 2015, Nickelodeon Parent Company Viacom with Sue MGA, for breach of contract, after it failed to pay $3.5 million for the production of a TV series based on their Lala loopsy dolls. They tried to flex their muscle and they said, well, if you don't agree to our way of seeing things in the conflict that we had, they said that conflict. We are going to stop your advertisement of toys. At the time, Nickelodeon was the number one ranked children's network and not to be able to advertise in Nickelodeon could have been a death now. But MGA, necessity is the mother of invention, that caused them to lean into digital advertising far more than any big brand had ever done before because they had to. They had to find a new way to reach kids. The court would ultimately rule in favor of Viacom. Both in LA Federal Court and on appeal in the 9th Circuit, Larian blamed the court to feed on what he contends was judicial bias. Nickelodeon Parent Company Viacom didn't respond to a request for comment. So, that by itself forced us to go and say, okay, they had with Nickelodeon. Let's find another way to reach children. And that's how we went and doubled up on YouTube especially and the rest as they say. So early on, MGA partnered with YouTube creators with huge audiences like Cookie Swirl-C. Good morning, Chucky Chippy Cookies. We are going to be spending the morning with this LOL surprise baby fancy. They took it another step further. They actually helped kids learn how to do their own unboxing videos. They gave them, you know, support and learning and tools. And so all these kids got to be kind of a little mini influencer themselves as they were unboxing their LOL products. So just to give you a flavor of how popular these videos are, go on to YouTube and search LOL surprise and you'll see videos with a million views, 10 million, 25 million, 50 million, even 100 million. There's a lot of them and kids are watching these videos and they're probably watching them over and over again. The old way toy manufacturers would do things is they buy TV which was about 90% of their ad spend and then traditional PR get on the big...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,688,2022-11-19 00:04:56
18075," and I'm over and over again. The old way toy manufacturers would do things is they buy TV, which was about 90% of their ads spend. And then, traditional PR, get on the big morning shows. It's an entirely different formula. It's much harder for toy companies right now because the formula is so complicated, you have to really take a deep dive into each platform. Am I promoting on Twitter? Am I promoting on Instagram? Am I promoting on TikTok? What am I doing on YouTube? You have to look at every possible social channel. By 2017, big toy brands like Mattel had shifted nearly 50% of their marketing budget to social platform advertising. Brands would help seed videos of their toys. And if they were lucky, that could kick off a wave of creators making their own content around the product. In 2020 alone, tubular labs estimated that LOL-related content had amassed 5.1 billion views. This idea of imitation. So when you see kids playing with product, it kind of excites the same neurons in your brain that happen when you do it yourself. The more we could show children, having this experience, the more kids felt what it would be like to have it and then wanted to experience it themselves. And one of the criticisms of this whole influencer movement among kids is that kids are young. They don't understand what's necessarily an advertisement versus real content. And that's a big criticism of this industry is that a lot of kids are getting on YouTube at young ages, not being supervised by their parents and just watching these videos. And they don't realize that maybe that influencer is getting paid by the brand to do that video or there's some other compensation. And that lures the lines for kids is they're sort of developing and figuring out how to consume media. Questionable advertising concerns aside, kids YouTube creators would take off. Channels like Ryan's World would grow to almost 30 million subscribers and a whole industry formed around them. When we first started working with influencers, they were very happy to work for free product. You give them the product and they do something for you. Then gradually influencers got smarter and started charging for their services as they started building a following. Now because it is such a big business, the dollars can be significant investing in big influencers. When Spin Master launched one of its new TV series and associated product, we made it a point to buy an advertising package with Ryan's World to ensure that we could get really quick, big reach right away. This is an advertisement for Spin Master. So from these unboxing videos, the content's gotten a lot more sophisticated. They're creating narratives around the toys, with voices, and meta-universes, if you will. And it's really engaging content, even more so than the original unboxing videos for these kids. And the content's coming out maybe once a week, or even daily. So if you think about it, what they've done is they've created basically a TV show around a toy. It's not unlike what we saw back in the 80s, which was criticized back then, by the way, when you've had toys like GI Joe, turned into an animated series, or Masters of Universe, or Transformers. So we've kind of seen this full circle now, right? So back to where we were, content, and basically many television shows created around toys on YouTube. Kids' content on YouTube is likely to face increased regulation in the coming years. In 2019, the company would agree on a $170 million settlement with the FTC for serving ads based on personal data to kids on YouTube. YouTube would put more emphasis behind its made-for-kids platform, YouTube Kids, and each video uploaded to YouTube must be flagged as either made-for-kids or not. In a statement outlining changes to the site, YouTube would say that, responsibility is our number one priority at YouTube, and this includes protecting kids and their privacy. Still, the site is far less regulated than traditional television. I do think parents have a better understanding of YouTube now, and the New Genres and formats there that they didn't prior, and they now notice things like, their kid isn't watching a toy unboxing. That's a commercial for a toy. Their kid is watching other kids-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,689,2022-11-19 00:09:25
18076," Prior and they now notice things like their kid isn't watching a toy unboxing That's a commercial for a toy their kid is watching other kids play with toys in an imaginative way Which inspires them to go play with things in the real world in an imaginative way In just a few short years YouTube had caused a transfer of power from toy and network executives to nine year olds and their families The Kaji family may have started out as toy reviewers, but now Ryan has launched his own line of toys a cartoon series He was even a blimp in the 2020 Macy's Thanksgiving parade You and I might think about Spider-Man or Snoopy But today's kids see that blimp of Ryan and they relate to him He's the character they want to grow up with he's he's the character that what they want to engage with and as we go forward These influencers are becoming more and more like big giant global brands and that has profound effects For entertainment going forward Air BnB is huge today on any given night you could have as many as two million people staying in an Air BnB all around the world You know our mission is that everyone can belong anywhere We're talking you know 300 million stays on any average year and there's tyranny in numbers The vast majority of Air BnB stays don't result in a safety incident But sometimes things go wrong and for Air BnB, you know, we're talking thousands of safety incidents that occur every year That the company has to handle and has to respond to I'm talking situations like kidnappings hostage cases. We're talking murder We're talking rape. We're talking you know the worst violent crimes that occur in our society Happen inside Air BnBs Air BnB never wants these kinds of cases to end up in the headlines You know that's really bad for their their brand their reputation and their public image Particularly because this is a business that's based on strangers trusting one another So when crimes like this occur that kind of threatens their entire business model I'm Olivia Carville. I'm a reporter on Bloomberg's technology team and I've been covering online travel companies like Air BnB for the last two years Air BnB is a startup that's based in Silicon Valley and like many of the sharing economy startups It managed to grow so big so fast by essentially skirting regulations It was based on that premise of move fast and break things and it wanted to work against regulations in order to grow as big as possible And win the popular vote because it became so popular so fast that cities could no longer control it An apiit night is past August we had one million people from around the world coming from a hundred eighty countries in a single night Staying in an Air BnB home The vast majority of Air BnB stays we're talking you know two million people staying in an Air BnB",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,690,2022-11-19 00:13:45
18077," single night staying in an Airbnb home. The vast majority of Airbnb stays. We're talking, you know, two million people staying in an Airbnb on any given night don't result in a safety incident. But sometimes things go wrong. And for the company, you know, it was dealing with these cases was a really challenging, difficult, complicated area. You had hosts and guests and sometimes they disagreed on what happened. You had regulatory issues in some of their bigger cities. Then you also had, you know, the growth of the platform and the fact that if you're going to try and prevent some of these incidents, it could cut into revenue and cut into the number of listings that you have. So for Airbnb, it was about trying to figure out the best way to handle these crises in a way that's going to not only protect the individual in crisis, but also protect the company's public image, its brand, its reputation, which is essentially what its business is based upon. As Airbnb grew, like way too big for them to be able to take all these calls alone, they developed a team of 100 highly specialised agents that handle the worst of the worst cases. Over the course of my reporting, I've talked to almost 50 former employees at Airbnb and you know, seven or eight of those work directly on this elite unit. These safety agents, many of them come from military backgrounds or trauma backgrounds, they're trained to handle traumatic situations and to try and, you know, help people who are going through what may be, you know, the worst day in their lives. For these safety agents, a lot of them understood that they had a dual role. First and foremost, they wanted to protect the user in crisis, but they also knew they had a responsibility to protect the company's brand and public image. I mean, everything about housing in New York is a total mess and it's always chaotic. It's not too surprising that Airbnb's biggest battle has broken out here. 2015 was a really challenging year for Airbnb. Airbnb's listings between 2010 and 2014 were essentially illegal hotels. You know, the company was seven years old now. It had grown huge. It was now a household name, but by growing that big that fast, they also came up against, you know, a pushback in regulations. Now, Airbnb's under attack and a lot of media citizens. Yeah, so what are they saying about this? They are, well, they can't give up on New York because New York's too important for every kind of reason. They knew that they couldn't lose the battle in New York because it was one of their biggest markets. And also, it could result in a domino effect. If other cities around America saw New York City either backing down on regulations or enforcing stricter regulations, that could in turn be rolled out right across the country. I think it's going to be awkward when they have to, you know, put in their perspectives, their risk factors when they have to say, well, you know, one risk is that the whole thing might be somewhat illegal in our biggest market. And in December of that year, a young woman from Australia flew into New York and stayed in an Airbnb with a group of her friends. They picked up a key from the local corner bodega without even needing identification. The police report said this 29-year-old woman left her friends at a midtown bar and returned to the Airbnb on her own. She thought that she was alone, but she wasn't. There was a man inside the apartment hiding in the shadows with a kitchen knife. He grabbed her, dragged her into her room, and raped her. He later fled. About an hour after this attack, he came back and police were in the apartment at the time. They opened his backpack and found three items of interest. The kitchen knife, one of the woman's earrings, and a set of keys to the Airbnb. This case was a really complicated one for Airbnb, partly because it occurred in New York City where they were fighting this really tough battle with city officials over regulations and partly because...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,691,2022-11-19 00:18:00
18078," B&B partly because it occurred in New York City where they were fighting this really tough battle with city officials over regulations and partly because the alleged rapist had the keys and he was inside the apartment. That meant that B&B needed to do what it could to protect itself. They wanted to find out, you know, how did he get the keys? That was a really big question for them. They launched an investigation to find that out. But before they did anything like that, before they thought to kind of protect their own reputation here, they really focused on doing what they could to help this young woman. They paid for her to move to a hotel. They paid for her mother to fly in from Australia. They paid for both of them to fly home. They offered to cover any health or lead or counseling costs that she might need later. But inside the company internally, they also launched an investigation. They wanted to know how did the alleged rapist get the keys? How did he get inside that B&B? And when they found out that the keys had been left at the corner of Odaiga, that then created a problem of liability for B&B. They didn't have a policy around key exchange. They didn't tell their hosts how they did or didn't have to hand keys over to guests as they were arriving. So for B&B, they also wanted to know what was going to be said in court. They wanted to know if any media were going to pick up on this story. And they wanted to know what their legal liability potentially could be. A week later, the alleged rapist was indicted in the Supreme Court in New York. And EBC sent a staff member to find out if the company was going to be mentioned in any of the court records. And it wasn't. It wasn't mentioned in the police report. It wasn't mentioned by prosecutors. There's no mention of EBC in any public record. This case has never been reported until now. And for EBC, that was kind of lucky. This case never landed in the media. And 18 months later, when this woman's lawyer reached out to the company, they signed a settlement for $7 million. And part of that settlement, there's a clause that says she cannot assert or imply responsibility on the part of the company. We've spoken to legal experts who indicate that what this really did is gag the woman from saying, I blame EBC. Airbnb is one of the few companies in the world that has this like online offline kind of hybrid situation where you have users who meet online and then actually meet in the offline world and stay under the same roof. And that means that the company at the end of the day really has to take more responsibility than other social media platforms might do. With Airbnb's terms of service, that really means that whenever there's a dispute between hosts and guests and the company, this is all handled behind closed doors in arbitration. Most of these cases don't even make it to the courtroom. And when they do, the company will settle them so it doesn't go on through the courts. And what that means is that there hasn't really been a legal precedent that's set to determine what your B&B's liability is here. You know, is it really responsible for when things go wrong inside its listings? What I learned over the course of my reporting is that this is anything but simple. This is a complicated, nuanced area. There are difficult trade-offs here. The company also has to have hard, you know, tough conversations.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,692,2022-11-19 00:22:19
18079," This is a complicated, nuanced area. There are difficult trade-offs here. The company also has to have hard, you know, tough conversations about policy. Airbnb's business model is based on strangers trusting one another. We often hear from the founders and the chief executive himself saying trust is their number one priority. I've actually heard Brian Cheske, the chief executive of Airbnb, talking about how he didn't build a website or a platform that allows people to stay in each other's homes, what he built was a community that trusts one another. And when that premise is undercut, Airbnb's entire business model is under three. For rooms, Earth View. Forms Earth View sounds far-fetched at the moment, doesn't it? But you know, we may be seeing ads like this in the not-too-distant future. Living away from Earth has always captured our imagination. As well as providing the basics for survival, these ideas are a symbol of human kinds' unique creativity and ambition. This advanced beast or a species station would be headquarters for the final ascend to the moon. Today, the idea of multiple outposts where we can live and work in space has never seen closer. We're going to fly. It's about making our lives the best we can make it. It's about as a species having a path for our future. And the mission to create these habitats is well underway as private companies get ready to take that next giant leap. The International Space Station, it's the only space habitat we have. One of the first places they take you in the ISS is the Kupel. So you can finally look at the Earth in all its beauty and I don't care who you are, it's always stunning, it's shocking, it's amazing because that's the view you've been waiting for your entire life. It passes over 90% of the world's population without most of us ever realizing. And at an estimated cost of $150 billion, it's the most expensive object we've ever built. You think about the cysteine chapel, the pyramids and the Burj Khalifa or take your pick. I mean, it far outstrips those. It's the one and only non-terrestrial human outpost. We've had a constant human footprint in orbit for almost 20 years because of the International Space Station. The collaboration between 15 countries started construction in 1998 and was pieced together in space over the course of a decade. Since 2000, it's been a permanently crude research laboratory, a space habitat that's allowed humankind to live, manufacture and explore beyond. The over arching achievement of the space station has been education. It has educated us about how to do research, it's educated us about how to live, it's educated us about the coarseness of the environment that it is in and it's about learning, I think. People say what was one of your favorite parts about being up there? Hands down, floating everywhere I went. But your first impressions for ISS certainly is how big it is. The ISS is a size of an American football field. With most of that footprint taken up by eight solar arrays, these provide enough energy to power 40Hz.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,693,2022-11-19 00:26:43
18080," The SS is a size of an American football field. With most of that footprint taken up by eight solar arrays, these provide enough energy to power 40 homes. The station has an American side and a Russian side, as well as contributions from other nations like Canada, Japan and the European Union. Astronauts on board can pass freely between these sections. They're living and working areas are made up of modules, each 4.2 meters in diameter, and in total, they have the same volume as a Boeing 747. The three main labs, destiny, hope and Columbus, are conducting up to 600 ongoing experiments at any one time. And while it's been a collaboration between governments to build and maintain the ISS, its next chapter will rely more on private enterprise. Today is a very remarkable day. NASA is opening the International Space Station to commercial opportunities and marketing these opportunities as we've never done before. Managing and maintaining the ISS costs $3.4 billion a year. That's over half NASA's space operations budget. Aging hardware and space debris will only add to these costs, which is why NASA is now hoping to pass some responsibility for the station over to commercial companies. We would like to see a robust commercial marketplace in lower orbit where space stations exist outside of NASA, the goal being that NASA could be a customer and we want to have numerous providers that are competing against each other on cost and innovation. With federal funding proposed to stop in 2025, opening the station to private enterprise would free up resources for the space agencies ambitions to return to the moon and journey to Mars. Transfrancing to a more commercial model is allowing industry to take over many of those areas that NASA has traditionally been responsible for, like the design and operations and maintenance of space systems. But the most exciting part, I think, is new opportunities. The iPhones would have never come from the government, for instance. The base technology came from the government, but the way it's used, the way it interacts with consumers, governments aren't really built for that. So I think that'll be exciting to see how private industry uses the same technology or the same systems, but then use them in a different way. Every NASA achievement has been the collaborative achievement of NASA and industry. What's going on right now that's a little bit different is NASA is turning to companies not to direct them what to do, but it's turning to companies to build relationships with them because those companies are attracting investment from non-space sources and are bringing a different kind of innovation to the table. In the shadow of NASA's sprawling Johnson Space Center, the headquarters of startup Axiom Space Night seemed a little modest, but their goal is big to build the first commercial space station. Led by a former ISS program manager, the team has been involved in every mission to the station since its inception. We know it has to be much lower cost operate on orbit than ISS is today, so this is key to continuing the heritage of the company. We need to continue the heritage of ISS. It's to start there so we can evolve everybody to the next platform. I liken this to the internet. So the internet was created and we got very excited. An indie kid with a good idea and just the basic programming skills could go build a program to do something. We have huge companies that grew out of that and still today there's new ideas, new things being built. The thing about a microgravity environment is... It's limitless. The data we have access to on the internet is limitless and it is not immediately obvious to us all the benefits that that's going to entail, but over time it will become very, very obvious. By 2024, Axiom plans to send a central node to attach to the ISS. That will make up the core of their new station. This will be followed by crew quarters for 16 people in research and manufacturing modules. When the ISS is retired, this will break away and additional modules with a lifespan of 30 years will be added and swapped out as they age using a robotic arm. And they're hoping to do all of this for 150th, the cost of the ISS. I mean, when you talk about our visions, how...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,694,2022-11-19 00:31:00
18081," Using a robotic arm and they're hoping to do all of this for one 50th the cost of the ISS. I mean when you talk about our vision it sounds really simple it really is about driving the thought process and the cost down so that anybody that wants to take advantage of our place in orbit and a microgravity environment can do so and that's really it. The International Space Station is a fantastic vehicle but one of the big things is they have quite a few major components outside which means you have to do an EVA, a spacewalk to go fix it. A spacewalk on a good day is a hundred hours of crew time to get ready and actually go do the spacewalk so we're able to take advantage of the reduced size of components and so our design is going to have all of the components are going to be in the pressurized environment. So we know what the basics are, you know water, food, clothing, life support and we know how to handle those. And now the next step is how do we make it more intuitive and we want to now take advantage of the technologies and the capabilities have today to build more luxury into the experience. The objective is to make the environment the background for all the users. Every day doing whatever you want to do on orbit, research, manufacturing, looking out the window, whatever you're there to do, we want you to be able to do that not even think about the environment and it's because of our experience on ISS and what the team brings to Axiom Space, we're able to build that environment. You won't worry about that. Three, two, one, release, release, release. Fire, fire. Like Virgin Galactic and Blue Origin, Axiom is hoping to attract space tourists with tickets starting at $55 million for a 10-day mission. But that's just one part of the commercial space station market that they think could be worth $37 billion over the next decade. Our first commercial customers are countries who have astronauts in space and want to expand their activity in space and countries who do not yet have a human spaceflight program who want to send people up. And we've now got both research and manufacturing companies who want to do work with us while we're at the International Space Station and on our platform after it separates from ISS. Human spaceflight is particularly exciting because it's that slice of space that is really nested. It hasn't undergone the crowding that satellites have had. It hasn't already had that explosive growth. It's really ready for that now. The first thing I'm really looking forward to seeing happen is the face of our first astronauts on orbit looking back down on us and knowing that we had a hand in sending that person to space. And ultimately the separation of ISS when it's ready to be retired and de-orbited and then we continue in space independently. For me that is a stepping-off moment for humanity. It's almost like when Neil Armstrong put that first boot on the moon. This will be the first time that we've gone from a platform of learning how to live in space to building our permanent home in space. Other private companies also want to use the ISS as the starting point for their own ventures. Big low-era space already has one of its inflatable structures attached to the station and others, including Sierra Nevada and Nanorax have put forward proposals. Space habitats are expensive. I think it's a false dichotomy to say, okay, we're done with the International Space Station. Let's move on to commercial platforms. What I think is much more likely and realistic in what NASA is certainly driving toward is an incremental transition where commercial platforms attach to the space station or work collaboratively with the space station. The next chapter cannot occur without the active engagement of companies. That said, that active engagement might not be as customers, might not be as drivers, it might be in service of government mission objectives. We will return American astronauts to the moon, not only to leave behind footprints and flags, but to build the foundation we need to send Americans to Mars and beyond.

18082," This proposed mission, along with SpaceX's own ambition to reach your red planet, has opened up a longer-term market. And some companies are already thinking beyond orbiting habitats like space stations to actually building on the surface of other planets. I was working in a firm designing skyscrapers and I saw Elon and he landed his Falcon X rocket in the middle of the ocean and that for me was a trigger. I thought, wow, this could actually happen and it's always been my dream to put a building on the moon or Mars. And if he's going at the pace he's going, it could definitely happen within my lifetime and I want to be the one to build it. In this warehouse, alongside startups from across the US, architecture firm AI Space Factory are refining the production of Marsha. A full story structure, they created for a NASA competition to design the next generation of space habitats on Mars. You know, when we started designing our Mars habitat, Marsha, I think we looked at everything that had been done already and kind of tossed that aside. But what we were given was a set of guidelines from NASA. They think the best way to build a habitat on Mars or the moon is to use what they call in situ resource utilization. So use the materials that are there. If you've seen sci-fi movies, you might see like glass and steel domes on distant planets, but the reality is to ship that kind of material to the moon or Mars would be so absorbed into the expense of you would never be able to build in the first place. So the idea is to send a 3D printing robot which can then harvest the materials you find on a site and build with that. The reusable print material is a mix of biopolymer made from recycled plastic or plants like corn and sugar cane and basalt, a rock found on Mars and Earth. It's the rock that gives us its incredible strength. We've tested this material, it's three times as strong as concrete in compression. It actually has what we call it a tensile capacity and prevent itself from being pulled apart which is something concrete is not very good at. You need to think at all times how do you optimize the amount of material that you use. And that's also why this thing is shaped like an egg. And if you think of an egg, it's very structurally optimized form. It's very, very thin, but it provides the strength that the egg needs. And that's why this is shaped the way that it is. The egg shape, as well as the nested shell structure, also accommodates for extreme differences in pressure and temperature on the surface of Mars. But more research still needs to be done to find out how print materials could be gathered and how 3D printing would work in a unique environment of space. You're dealing with a completely different set of physics and environments which is very harsh, the cold, the low gravity, the vacuum of space. And finding solutions for how to build or do anything in space just requires a high degree of innovation. There's no such thing as brute force when it comes to space. Like you need to think about the problem, find a very elegant, lightweight, cost-effective solution. The next challenge is really going to places on Earth, literally taking the dirt that we're finding on a site and beginning to print with the dirt. We have to perfect this technology on Earth, and then we go prove it out on a moon, and then finally on to Mars. The first customers could include NASA and companies like SpaceX who would lease out these structures for individual missions. But before that, AI space factory hoped their technology could be monetized as well as transformational here on Earth. The challenges of building on Mars forced us to kind of make this jump in construction technology which we can now apply on Earth to build more sustainably. So rather than building with steel and concrete, which are these manufactured very energy intensive materials, to go to a site, have a solar-powered array that would then allow our 3D printer to print in the most sustainable way possible. And we never would have found these ways that wasn't for the challenge of building in space. 3, 2, 1, ignition and lift off of the Falcon 9 to the Space Station on the first commercial launch from Kennedy Space Centers, historic had 39A. Humans have now been consistently living and working in space for more than 15 years, and if we want to keep that up, what do habitats need to look like?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,696,2022-11-19 00:39:39
18083," and consistently living and working in space for more than 15 years. And if we want to keep that up, what do habitats need to look like? And frankly, they can be larger, they can be small. But the future of space habitats really, to me, comes down to the ability to persistently maintain human presence. Whether that's a few people or many people, that seems to be the dividing line between where we were before and where we want to be in the future. We have to learn how to benefit from what we do on orbit and bring those natural benefits back home. So we help ourselves out on the ground while we also learn to live somewhere else. And it really, at the very deepest level, is about survival or species. So I get pretty excited when I spend a few moments thinking about what we're off to go do because this really is the first step to learning to live off the planet. That first step is just the start of our journey to create a lasting legacy in space. While commercial companies may be stepping in to imagine what these new space habitats look like, it's what's happening inside of them that may unlock the future of space and industrialisation. On the next episode of Giant Leap, we'll visit the private companies who are looking to build their business around manufacturing in space. Using the unique properties of microgravity, they plan to create new materials with extraordinary qualities that can't be replicated on Earth, including new manufacturing techniques that could change how we build large structures in space and even unlock the ability to 3D print full human organs. But before low Earth orbit can become a new industrial centre, we're going to need to take another giant leap. This is how it used to work. A real estate agent would lock in the client, they'd stage the place, hold an open house every single weekend, and hope that the right buyer walks through that door. Ten years ago, you could probably go look at a house and circle back two to three weeks later and still have an opportunity to make a bid. The first time I received a lead through Instagram, my mind was blown. If you're seeing something in a neighbourhood that is established, you have two to three days after the open house in this market to make an offer. Our world has shifted so much. Folks are getting comfortable doing business either through social media or 100% virtual. Social media, like everything else it touches, has turned the real estate business upside down. You've heard this trope before, millennials aren't buying and owning as much as their parents' generation, be it a car, a diamond, or a home. But the lack of ownership is not always by choice. In 2018, a survey found that 89% of millennial Americans want to buy a home. They just can't afford it. As of 2019, millennials of all stripes owned only 5% of US housing, compared with 15% for gen Xers. Millennials haven't been able to make these big ticket purchases the same way as their predecessors did. Now this is down to the financial crisis. We have rising student loan debt and a higher cost of living. Now millennials are getting older, they're earning more.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,697,2022-11-19 00:44:08
18084," It's down to the financial crisis. We have rising student loan debt and a higher cost of living. Now, millennials are getting older. They're earning more money and saving more. So now is about the time where a lot of them are going out and making those purchases. And now, having been stuck at home for over a year, the same generation that embraced Uber's and Airbnb's wants something to call their own. I got married and I have a child. So, you know, looking for more space and thought about a conventional route of young and single and living the city and then move out to the suburbs when you have a kid in a wife. I've seen a whole bunch of my friends just move on down to say the West Palm Beach, Miami area, Austin, Texas. So they are certainly moving out of the city, but space was top of mind for them moving out. We lived in Williamsburg for about 16 plus years and week two in the pandemic, we just realized we needed more. So we started looking for a house right away. We now live in Gosha, New York, which is about an hour and a half from New York City. Instagram accounts like Circa Houses and Cheap Old Houses offer a glimpse into the perfect suburban life. Often at a price point, not too dissimilar to what adults pay for rent in major cities. By the end of 2020, New Yorkers who didn't flee paid an average of $2,700 a month for an apartment, even as rent prices plummeted during the pandemic. Millennials make a large percentage of spending right now and that makes them a valuable consumer for brands. That means they're being courted by everyone out there to spend with them. They grew up online. They're comfortable with pretty much anything that you can do there. And that's buying things, selling things, Craigslist, eBay, all that. Making a $100 purchase on Craigslist or a $1,000 purchase on eBay, it's not that much of a leap to go even further. If you're buying a fancy piece of jewelry or a house for a million bucks. The uptick in home demand, fueled by the pandemic, combined with record low interest rates has made home buying extremely competitive over the last year. So much so that some millennials look to social media to shop and actually buy their first house, site unseen. I saw sort of something on my Instagram feed and you know, clicked and we ended up seeing this house. Houses weren't really being shown at that time because we were in full lockdown. We became really interested in one YouTube video, 20 Z-LO photos, and that is it. The Red Hot Housing Market spells opportunities for developers targeting this demographic, getting eyeballs strictly through social media. People are not looking in the back section of the times anymore for real estate listings. Our demographic is between late 20s to mid 40s. And that demographic is spending a lot of time on social media and they're doing a lot of shopping via Instagram and other social media platforms. This is Joshua Gelb and Pepe Hamburger. During the pandemic, the two New York City based developers started Neville House, a new construction project two hours north of the city. Unlike most traditional real estate listings, the pair bypassed the use of a broker and advertised their homes directly on Instagram. No fees, no commissions. You used to have to hire a broker, work with them, they would do showings on site. Now you basically put your renderings on Instagram and within an hour you have 15, 20 replies saying, can I come see it directly with you and let's see it tomorrow and it's just completely changed the game. Most people have that image in their head of the quit-essential upstate modern cabin set in the woods. We've definitely tried to tap into that and create something that's attainable for these people. It's like you can have that, you can be swiping through Instagram and that can be your home too. There's been quite a proliferation of these direct to consumer brands. There's just tons of them out there. It's not that hard to start up a website that sells things and get things manufactured for that e-commerce platform. So like all birds with shoes, Casper with mattresses or Warby Parker with glasses. All of that means a lot more opportunity for brands in the online shopping space. So it's natural that real estate would want to get involved as well with these big ticket items. 10 years ago, the broker would drive the search. Now I say.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,698,2022-11-19 00:48:32
18085," they would want to get involved as well with these big ticket items. 10 years ago, the broker would drive the search. Now I think that my clients texts me listings. They have alerts. They find things quicker than we do sometimes because we're out and about. I'd say that the buyer is much more involved these days. Social selling is creating brand new ways to shop. So let's look at vintage clothing, for example. There are sellers on Instagram finding successful ways to sell one of a kind items. It's that fleeting nature, the ephemeral nature of social media. You post the item online and whoever's first gets that one of a kind item. Now real estate has similar scarcity to it. There's one place to buy. It's one home, one apartment, one thing. It's one of a kind. But the rise in social media real estate isn't just about the instant gratification. Researcher Andre Perry, who studies economic inclusion at the Brookings Institute, says social media has evolved from the days of online hangout spaces and mood boards to a powerful change agent. Social media is a primary source to get news and information. But it's not just about social media. It's about the movement that we're in. The racial justice uprising really gave people a sense of worth and empowerment. And so people not only are getting information about what protects people in the long run from economic shocks, things like wealth. In his research, Andre found that not only are more millennials buying homes during the pandemic, the rate of home ownership among black millennials are at historic highs. The fastest way to accumulate wealth in this country traditionally has been through home ownership. Millennials in particular are saying, hey, I want protection. I want to live longer. I want my education to go further. Let me acquire wealth. And the fastest way to do that is through home ownership. When the pandemic hit many of the amenities or the comforts that came along with those living conditions were gone. Folks couldn't go to bars and fancy shops. And so you saw instead of people going out and buying clothes, they saved their money and bought property and outside of the city generally. People are moving to the suburbs, to rural areas, places where home prices are a little bit cheaper. Many home buyers are looking for houses outside the major metropolitan areas. Additionally, many home buyers are looking for direct outdoor access and edit space as the uncertainty about the virus persists. Millennials are also looking to influencers not just for the latest trends and TikTok dances, but to partake in important conversations, be it about politics or personal finance or anything in between. Real estate ownership. Let's start small. Let's don't be scared to start small. Instead, instead of renting a big house in the hills in California, like most artists do buy you one that's on the flat. I meet folks like Brandon Rull and Charlotte main the God. You have residential real estate and you have commercial real estate. They're talking about buying homes. When I was coming up, really home buying was a mysterious, shrouded process that only a few people could teach me. Now I can easily log on to Clubhouse or Instagram and find literally lessons on how to purchase a home, but done with savvy and finesse. Today we're going to make a greenhouse. I am DIY-ing the entire closet. Heather, having bought her fixer-up her site on scene, also looked to internet personalities to help figure out how to modernize and to make sure her home was also an investment. It gave us a lot of confidence. They make it look super easy. How we could do all of those things ourselves. My husband just installed a laundry shoe, which is something we never would have thought of if we didn't see an influencer do that and how easy it actually is. Really simple to do it yourself project. You can do that. You have any questions. Go ahead and message me. And in the case of Neville House, Josh and Paley hope that buyers see these homes as potential secondary income. These young families look at these products or look at our homes and say, here's a turnkey, this can serve our family, but this can also be the person.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,699,2022-11-19 00:52:42
18086," Come. These young families look at these products, or look at our homes and say, here's a turnkey, this can serve our family, but this can also be the perfect rental. We've tried to strike a balance in the design of the home who are working well as a family home. That's going to be lived in and also working as an investment. A lot of this just points to how millennials can utilize and leverage social media to their benefit. But it also speaks to, again, this moment that folks want freedom. So millennials are really stepping up to this real estate game and taking ownership and building well. Of course, not everything is as it seems online. While social media can be a useful tool for learning, there's still a lot it can't tell you about the home buying experience, or living in the suburbs for that matter. We knew going into it, budgeting for a lot of renovations. We kind of thought if we buy it at $450, we could put to $300,000 into the house and really make it ours and our own. We can't wait to replace in this kitchen and update our built-in deep fryer, which was not in the listing photos. We kind of got into the house and we realized that budget was completely unrealistic. We have a lot of people who see our design on Instagram, and they say, I love it. Can you come build this on my property? And then they'll send us the lot, which they bought site unseen during COVID and because of site conditions or zoning, it's virtually unbuildable. I think we all know that what you see on Instagram and what you see in real life are two very different things. So while we can definitely, as brokers, create these fantastic narratives, the one recommendation that I would give is do your homework. Don't believe everything you say. That's not to say that there's dishonesty or anything where people are trying to manipulate you, but not everything you see is accurate. This shift towards social media house hunting may also help to bring equilibrium to a market that has historically disadvantaged specific groups of buyers. Many of the traditional ways that people get mortgages or loans often precluded black people because they deemed us too risky for those loans. With technology, there's ways to get around that. As long as more black people get educated on racism and discrimination and lending, we're going to figure out ways to get around that racism. When I was 24 years old, I saw the UFC on a paper view on TV, and I was so overwhelmed by the athleticism, the skill. Oh, I'm coming! I'm coming! I'm coming! And then at the end of the fight, the combatants hugged a shook hands, and I just fell in love with it. Part of UFC's appeal is it doesn't look like a ballad athletic display of martial talent and mastery as much as it looks like a bar fight. We choose to do that because we...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,700,2022-11-19 00:57:02
18087," fight. We choose to do this because we love this work, but it is a business. And if you do not treat it like a business, I guarantee you that the promoter is, and you will be left broken, broken at the end of your career. Each of us have an individual story, but as with anything you take enough of these individual stories and you see not only crossover but intersectionality. A group of former UFC fighters that are suing the UFC scored a key legal victory on Thursday when a federal judge said he would grant their lawsuit class action status. There have been fights in every major US sport about workers' power in the labor market. I don't think there's a guy in the sport from the guy who just got his first fight all the way up to the Conor McGregor's that is pleased with the way the UFC treats fighters. The way we've been strong armed, the way we've been coerced. Fights over unionization in some sports, fights over free agency in baseball, and in boxing the Muhammad Ali Act, which restricts the kinds of contract terms that can be imposed on boxers. The fighters who brought this lawsuit see it as the continuation of a tradition in sports of athletes fighting to have agency and power in the terms of their work and who they do it for. Mixed Martial Arts used to be pretty culturally and legally fringe in the United States. It was banned by most states, John McCain had famously called it human cock fighting. There are some rules in the UFC, but to a large extent all sorts of body parts and tactics and attacks are on the table and people get seriously injured at times. My nose has been broken multiple times. I have my right pectoral torn off, how to get that reattached. I've had my jaw broken in two places, I've had my neck broken. I had my left ankle broken, how to get that repaired. I've had a torn right labor in my shoulder. He broke my eyeball, I mean the bone that holds up my eyeball. I've had my left eye orbital fracture twice when my eye caved in. I was walling my own blood. I knew, don't blow your nose or both eyes. At the time that UFC was bought for just $2 million by the former boxing coach Dana White and a casino owner he'd been friends with Lorenzo Fertita and his brother Frank Fertita, UFC was struggling as were other mixed martial arts promoters. It was pretty much a fixer upper. The money that they spent to actually purchase it for $2 million was much less than the money they quickly had to sink into it in order to revitalize it. They've hold off a multi pronged strategy that was quite successful. First they did what White has referred to as running towards regulation. They found ways to make compromises with state regulators so that the sport would not be illegal. And at the same time, they also popularized it. They made gambles like paying the production costs themselves for the first season of a reality TV show the ultimate fighter on Spike TV. UFC under Dana White had a gift for weaving, compelling personal narratives and rivalry, while throwing shoes, a guy coming to the octagon with who let the dogs out playing while he was dragging another guy on a leash. My first contract with the UFC is kind of an interesting story because here I am on this reality show the ultimate fighter and they started to realize how big of a stepping stone this was going to be for the UFC. They set us all down individually, put a contract in front of us and said, hey, we realized it. We are going to be huge and we are going to be huge and we are going to be huge and we are",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,701,2022-11-19 01:01:21
18088," being so this was going to be for the UFC. It's at us all down individually, put a contract in front of us and said, Hey, we realized that this is going to be huge and we really want to have you all a part of it. UFC family moving forward. So we want to go ahead and get this out of the way. Just sign this simple contract and we'll be able to move forward as one unit. But as I'm looking at this thick contract and wondering what I should do, they know why it looks at me and says, don't worry, this thing takes off, we'll take care of you. The fighters would say at the heart of UFC's power is the contracts that it signs with fighters. Before boxing had competition boxing used to be dominated by a few dominant promoters, and the contracts were ported over from boxing. And the contracts are basically designed to control every aspect of a fighter's career. They're long-term. They last multiple fights. Fighters under these contracts are bound to fight only for UFC for a period of time. And UFC can extend that time if a fighter declines a match or if a fighter gets injured. They control who the fighter fights, they control when the fighter fights, and then they have a number of different clauses that make it very difficult for a fighter to ever break free from UFC if that fighter ever did want to become a creation. Contracts are so one-sided, there really is no negotiation room for any of the things, especially as you're coming up and as they're stranglehold on the sport of MMA got so much stronger. Part of what's at the heart of this lawsuit is the ways that UFC successfully took other competitors off the board. The UFC had such a stranglehold on mixed martial arts, and as they were buying up so much of the competition, shutting them all down, they really became the only option for anybody that wanted to do this professionally. If you follow Dana White's Twitter or watch him on YouTube, you could have seen Dana White calling himself the grim reaper and bragging about how he has defeated or derailed or acquired one after another company that tried to compete with the UFC. In 2011, UFC acquired Strike Force, which at the time was the most prominent rival still standing. The CEO of Strike Force Scott Koker has said in the past that he saw himself like Luke Skywalker up against the Death Star trying to compete with UFC. Eventually, when Strike Force was bought out by UFC, my only option was go to UFC because they had to rest my contract. I'm under a contract where it's only an 18 month contract with six fights, but five years later, I'm still stuck in the contract. The month before UFC's parent company, Zufa, completed its acquisition of Strike Force, a UFC executive sent an email and the subject line of that email was, we own MMA. The UFC has admitted in documents that have now become public that they've almost never lost a fighter that they wanted to keep.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,702,2022-11-19 01:05:36
18089," I've become public that they've almost never lost a fighter that they wanted to keep. In internal UFC emails, we now know the company referred to what it was doing as choking off oxygen to the competition. The most important oxygen that UFC allegedly ran a foul of the law by cutting off to its competitors is the fighters themselves. And now that they make it clear to us, they make it clear to the whole mixed martial arts world, there is no negotiating. These are very strict, never-ending contracts and that's the case of this day. The UFC just says, oh, you want to fight for us, you sign here. If you don't want to, we've got 20 other guys that will take your spot. They have 70, 80, 90% of the top fighters under exclusive contract, meaning that those fighters are not available to any other MMA promoter. And fighters, even if they wiggled their way out of the very restrictive contracts that UFC imposed on them, didn't have another professional mixed martial arts option because there weren't robust rivals to go sell their work to. On Tuesday afternoon, a class action lawsuit was filed in US District Court in San Jose against Zufa, LLC with fighters Kung Lee, Nate Quarry and John Fitch attached to the suit. My name is John Fitch, I'm a big dressing, came to me and says, hey, come, I know this lawyer, he will help get the fairness for the fighters in the marketplace. And I decided I wanted to step up for all the fighters that being affected. At the end of 2014, more than six years ago now, a group of now all former fighters filed anti-trust class action lawsuit against UFC. And in broad terms, the case is an anti-trust case where we're claiming that the UFC is both a monopoly and a monopsony. Usually when we talk about monopoly, we're talking about the power that a company has when it becomes the only one selling something. Monopsony is about the power of being a monopoly purchaser of something and particularly a monopoly purchaser of labor. A key argument in this lawsuit has been about as UFC succeeds and its revenue sores, how much should we expect that absent illegal conduct, the fighters pay would soar as well. In UFC, year after year, the share of the company's revenue that goes to actually paying the workers doing the fighting has hovered around or below 20%. And what this analysis shows through complex statistical regression modeling is that if the UFC was competitive and did not allegedly violate the anti-trust laws, it would pay its fighters 50% or more of the revenues generated just like baseball, just like hockey, just like basketball, boxing. If instead of paying 20% of the revenues generated, it paid 50% or more of the revenues generated and the fighters would have made $1.6 billion more during the period that we measured 2010 to 2017. Sometimes when you write about allegations against companies and particularly about lawsuits against companies, those companies don't want to say a whole lot about them or are pretty dismissive of the significance of litigation against them. UFC in their comments to me has been pretty feisty about this, saying that they see this lawsuit actually as a threat to the ability of businesses to take risks and succeed, and that they don't want to roll over, that they want to fight it and they want to defeat it. The fighters I talk to describe having side jobs, being reliant on UFC in part because after taxes and expenses, they weren't making enough money to feel financially secure. The overview of my career from a financial perspective is something that had a challenge for me, and it is an opportunity for me to become on the 35th because I thought while",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,703,2022-11-19 01:10:06
18090," King enough money to feel financially secure. The overview of my career from a financial perspective is something that I've had a challenge in admitting I can tell you now that I lived in my mom's attached to a rock the entire time I was fighting and I had a second job as a bouncer at a bartender, a third job as a personal trainer just to make ends meet. Nate Quarry told me that over his time in UFC he fought fights while he was tens of thousands of dollars in debt coming into the fight. It gets so disheartening because I've seen fights that are called the fight of the year. This is just this brutal war and they battled for four and a half rounds until one guy's body just gave up and then you find out oh that guy made $60,000 for that fight. In one of the hearings in this lawsuit UFC's attorney argued that if the fighters were really the product, if all that UFC were selling were the fighters then the fighters wouldn't need UFC at all. That a fighter is not themselves the UFC product any more than an Apple engineer who makes a cool iPhone is the product that Apple is selling. We the fighters make this whole thing happen and it's been driven by Chuck LaDale. It's been driven by Reyna Couture. It's been driven by Conor McGregor. It's been driven by Brock Lesnar. It's been driven by all the greats that have walked before us and that walk this path right now. We are the product. If the fighters are not the product then go ahead and release this from our contracts. You'll do fine without us. Clearly. It's the identity and rank and popularity of those fighters that attract the eyeballs and make the sport what it is and if you can lock all those up and keep them from other promotions you can dominate the sport which is what they've admitted they've done. William Isaacson, a lawyer for UFC, said in a statement that UFC has spent many years building a world-class organization enhancing the brand of our athletes and championing the sport of MMA. UFC pays its fighters more than any other MMA promoter with average fighter compensation rising by over 600% since 2005. Our efforts have raised the global popularity of the sport and the overall revenue potential of all MMA organizations and athletes. In December of 2020 the judge announced a crucial step in this lawsuit which is that he is going to certify it as a class action. Class certification makes this lawsuit a much more significant threat to UFC and the judge made clear long before saying how he planned to rule that he expected whatever he did to be appealed into federal appeals court and on from there to the US Supreme Court. So we are likely in for many more months and years of wrangling over this. Kyle Kingsbury said that he doesn't think any settlement would be acceptable unless it includes a change to the restrictive contracts that UFC uses to keep fighters bound to the UFC. My son is about to turn six years old and it started when he was in the womb. We are in this thing to the end to change the sport forever. We want the same freedoms that are offered in any other major sport and we are, every other major sport has gone through what we are going through right now. We will tell fighters, you know, just shut up. Look at how lucky you are. Well, no, actually we are fighting for what we believe in. We are going to continue being fighters and that is how we are made.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,704,2022-11-19 01:14:25

Every nation that's a coastal state has some region of the sea floor that falls within their territorial waters and many countries including the US, the area that's underwater exceeds the area that's above water. So huge amounts of nations, areas and regions are just really unexplored, uncharacterized. We don't really know what's there. We know less about our sea bed than we do about the surface of the moon or Mars. Only 20% of it has been mapped. A map of the sea floor could lead to all kinds of discoveries, like numerous species and rare earth minerals like cobalt that we need for electric cars and mobile phones. The value of all the gold deposits are loan on the sea floor is estimated to be around 150 trillion dollars. A map could also help us when tragedy strikes. Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 disappeared from radar screens. The mapping of the ocean floor is being carried out. The problem is that the southern Indian ocean is just so incredibly huge. To me, a map is a fundamental piece of understanding of who we are, where we are, where things are. Once you understand something, you start to value it more. When you start to value something, that's when you start to really think about making it healthy and preserving it and keeping it going. A map is the first step. It's the basic understanding that you need to figure out where you are. Oceans. They cover over 70% of the planet, but most of what lies underneath is a mystery. The sea floor is a really fascinating landscape. We don't have a lot of data to describe the shape of it in detail, but in places where we do, there are spectacular features. There's meandering channels with all kinds of interesting topography. There are canyons, there are sea mounts, mid ocean ridges, all kinds of things that we see on land that are just basically hidden from us by the water. As it stands, this is what a map of the sea bed looks like. All that black? Those are the parts we haven't mapped yet. At present, most people think that the sea floor is actually mapped because you'll see a world ocean map and you can see some shape of the sea floor, but most of that is based on prediction. Roughly 80% of what you see for the world ocean floor is modeled based on measurements of the sea surface height and a computation based on gravity. In 2017, the Nippon Foundation and the General Barthometric Chart of the Oceans, or Gecko, launched SeaBed 2030. It's a collaborative project to collect and collate data ocean wide and create a complete map of the sea floor by the end of the decade. To do this would take one ship around 350 years at a cost of up to $3 billion. That's why data is harvested by all kinds of vessels from fishing boats to freighters. Because there is so little data, it's important that vessels that are capable and willing to acquire data when they're just moving around the ocean do so. So we have a lot of data that's collected during transit. There's a lot of academic requirements to make data publicly available. There's industry data that's starting to become more and more available. There's government data. So there's a lot of different ways that this data is coming in and it's a really messy and challenging puzzle to put together. But what's exciting is that it's a puzzle to put together. Since SeaBed 2030 launched, the area map has risen to 20 percent and all the information collected is freely available.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,705,2022-11-19 01:18:50
18092," 3D models and you know kind of come up with these visualizations. It's not the same as that feeling of looking out over this big landscape, but I mean I think we'll get there soon with VR and other kinds of technology, but it's really spectacular to think about, especially with the familiarity that some of us have with these features, like what it looks like. We look out at the ocean and it just looks flat, maybe with little bumps. We really don't think about all of this that's underneath and it's really an amazing landscape that's just hidden from us. With more than 90% of the ocean deeper than 200 metres, fleets of autonomous vehicles could make the data gathering process faster, cheaper and safer. And new discoveries might help with exploration of all kinds. I think the ocean can actually provide us with huge incisors, we go out into space as well and look for life and other kinds of life forms. I also think in this next few years we will have a different kind of access to the ocean because of virtual reality and augmented reality. And so that will allow us to sit in our living rooms and really experience what's underwater in a different way and see this different alien planet. You You Since the dawn of man, meat has been on the menu. And even with growing trends of vegetarian diets and plant-based substitutes, around 89% of the world population consider themselves omnivores. We have come a long way from our hunter and gatherer roads. We have managed to establish a whole industry designed to feed almost 7.7 billion people. We have maximized production and we managed to reduce hunger over the past couple of decades. And although we've become exceedingly efficient at putting meat on the table, raising livestock animals by the billions comes with its own set of consequences. If animal agriculture continues to expand the way it has, there is a race that we won't be able to stop climate change. But with rapid advances in technology, we might soon see a food industry that leaves all those problems behind. I'm about to be one of the world's first commercial customers for lab-grown meat cultured meat. It's eaten just as the company and I'm very, very excited. Here is the chicken. It's pretty crispy outside. It's really good. I mean, look, it's really tasty. Here at 1880 in Singapore, cultured chicken is being served under a regulatory approval granted by the Singaporean government. It's the very first time a cultured meat product, meat made from animal cells grown in a lab, has been approved for commercial sale.

The closer they hold that flashlight to the seafloor, the smaller your beam is, which also means the smaller that you can find information or data about. So it really depends on the depth of the seafloor in order to see how much you can define an object. This variation in depth means that mapping resolution will range from 100 by 100 meters in shallow waters to 800 by 800 meters in the deepest parts of the ocean, which go down as far as 11,000 meters. Remotely operative vehicles or ROVs can then be sent down to investigate seabed features up close. We've just crossed the 1000 metre mark, it's 4.6 degrees C, and now we're going to drive the ROV down at a high rate towards the seafloor. On a recent mapping expedition, scientists on the Falcon discovered a 500 metre tall coral structure in Australia's Great Barrier Reef, the first to be discovered in over 120 years. A place that is incredibly popular, well-visited, well-traveled, you know, we're still finding new things. You don't know until you map it, and so until you get that sort of high resolution picture, you don't know the sand waves or the old river beds that used to be there, or the waterfalls off the side of a volcano that used to be above the surface and now is below the surface. It's a little bit of everything. Think of, let's say Hawaii, or someplace where you see a volcano above the water, picture that below the water. I'm really kind of obsessed with the whole concept of scale here. Although we can create 3D models and, you know, kind of come up with these visualizations, it's not the same as that feeling of looking out over this big landscape.

18094," has been approved for commercial sale. Each just, the company behind these chicken nugget-style dishes, is based out of San Francisco and got their start in 2011 developing plant-based egg substitutes, like mung bean scrambled eggs and mayonnaise. But it wasn't until 2017 that they announced they were shifting focus to a cultured meat product. In order to feed the world that we live in, a lot of animal protein, we need to take a third today. It'll be more tomorrow of our world and make it dedicated to feeding chickens and cats. We go to areas that are filled with biodiversity rainforests, taking a bulldozer to them and planting soybean corn, to feed the chickens that we climate change is accelerated by the kind of animal production that we engage in. When we bring animals in tiny little spaces, it accelerates the probability that more zoonotic diseases are going to impact our families. And from a morality perspective, why do we need to cause any harm to any other living thing? To have dinner that tastes good, it does not have to be that way. And those things underlie the force of this idea. The meat alternatives that have made it to the market thus far have been plant-based. Immutation, beef and pork made from ingredients like pea protein and coconut oil by companies like Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods. That's a very different proposition from cultured meat, which is made from actual animal cells. I'm a huge fan of any company, of any person trying to make a product that's improving the food system, including all the plant-based proteins. Maybe in some future menu, you'll have this kind of cultivated chicken and you also have a plant-based version. That's fine. But I guess you have to ask yourself in our lifetime, is that diner likely to also remove the conventional option on the menu, too? We do think we need a more permanent solution. We do think we sort of need, if you will, an in-game to this problem. And we just think this is more likely to be the path to achieve that. So animal cell technology has been around for several decades for applications such as development of vaccines and other biotherapeutics. The first known prototype of cultured meat was done by Mark Posts earlier in 2011. And essentially, he was developing beef patty. It was a very expensive prototype. If I'm not mistaken, above 250,000 euros at the time to produce just one beef patty, it was more of a group of concepts to really demonstrate that this technology is possible and that it can be done. The way that we grow and produce culture chicken is essentially we isolate chicken cells from the chickens without having to kill them. So from a small biopsy, for instance, we immerse these cells in a liquid broth that contains the nutrients that the cells need to survive and be healthy and to grow. We really need these cells to multiply, to reach the numbers that are sufficient to make a meat product. We're looking into the cells that are really important for meat. So we think about muscle cells, fat cells, by the isolation, we are able to form those muscle tissues in culture. The culture happens inside of a fermentation tank, what we call the bioreactor, which is essentially providing the same conditions as the animal body. Warm temperatures, some sort of mechanical stimulation, so that the cells that are exposed to very similar conditions that they have inside of the animal. After the cells proliferate and reach a certain density, the final step is essentially to separate those cells from the liquid broth that they are in. We just make sure that the product needs our quality and safety standards and then those cells are ready for consumption. Milk, cheese, yogurt. A lot of those derive from fermentations. The only difference is that they are starting from a different cell type. In this case, we're just using the animal cells as the initial and beginning of the product. Eatjust has developed chicken nuggets so far, with far more textured chicken breast plan for the future. But another cell-based meat starter.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,708,2022-11-19 01:31:49
18095," Eatjust has developed chicken nuggets so far with far more textured chicken breast plan for the future. But another cell-based meat startup Memphis Meets has already started working on culturing other animal cells as well. We've done beef, we've done duck, we've done chicken, and these are things that are favorites in various parts of the world. For instance, you know, people in America love beef and chicken. People in China love duck, so we wanted to show that we at Memphis Meets can produce meats that we as a global population love to eat. There's a lot of similarity on how we grow the meats from various animals or fish. But they're also different because of nutrients they need and how they actually come together to form the final product they meet. And I think it's very similar to how we also grow various animals. There's similarities in the feed that we gave cows and pigs and chickens, but there's also differences how we cultivate it. And it's very similar for us as well. So we've been working with the FDA and the USDA for the last three years and really developing the guidelines on how this food should be regulated when we come to the market. As soon as we get regulatory approval in the United States, people will be able to go to the supermarket and buy it and enjoy it. They'll be able to go to a restaurant near them and order meat directly from animal cells. But it's not just getting the meat right. Once approved, the gates open to a very high potential demand and scaling becomes the next big hurdle. Before we can only make chicken for myself, my friends, my friends, my family, my colleagues. Now we actually have the ability to make chicken for millions of people. So that allows us to invest into allowing the economies to scale to drop the price. The second is we need to reduce the cost of the nutrients that these cells are consuming. So I think chicken feed raises or drops a price of chicken. The nutrients we feed ourselves those are the same things. We need to drive that down. The cell density is another technical element. We need to continue to increase that and hammering on those things. So of course the next five, 10, 15 years, we'll put us in a place where we're significantly below the cost of this animal protein. And that will be one of the main inflection points that we'll lead to a new way of eating meat. So here's a close up of a half eaten crispy chicken bite. You know what? What I'm really thinking is, I'm just eating chicken. I like chicken. You know, the normal chickens eat, I don't know where they came from. And so I don't know why I should be very stressed where this came from either. The meat market is worth more than $1 trillion annually and there are over 60 startups in the cultured meat field. Culture and meat has attracted several prominent investors including Sergi Brin, Richard Branson and Bill Gates. What is also interesting is that even meat giants such as Cargill and Tyson have invested in space. It's this disruptive potential of the market as well as the promise to greatly reduce the climate impact of meat production that has attracted investors. It remains to be seen who will get regulatory approval in which countries and whether consumers will like lab-grown meat enough to make the switch. And while there's no evidence that lab-grown meat is any less healthy than traditional meat, there's an ongoing debate over how healthy eating meat is in general. But if these products are a success, they could be the beginning of a more humane, less destructive meat industry. The food and ag industry is the most innovative industry in the world. It's always figured out how to feed a growing population. And we've never failed doing so. And it's been very clear to us that we are part of that and we're going to figure out how to feed the next three billion people joining us. And I just see an evolution. We can do this a bit differently. We can do this in a way that is consistent with the kind of people that we want to be, the kind of planet that we all want to live in. We can build a food system that reflects really the best characteristics of who we are. And that makes me really hopeful.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,709,2022-11-19 01:36:15
18096," You In possible foods might be the world's most ambitious company. Just listen to founder and CEO Pat Brown. Yes, impossible stated goal really is to replace the use of animals as a food production technology globally by 2035. That would mean supplanting a $1.2 trillion industry not to mention a source of sustenance as old as time. To be fair, the company has got a lot of people talking about its products. So there's this thing called the impossible burger. Let's call it artificial meat. The realest, the biggest burger in the world. Not bad. But before impossible foods can take over the world, it's going to have to overcome strong competitors, penetrate tough new markets and generally transform its product from a conversation piece into a ubiquitous staple food. With the coronavirus turning the world of food upside down, this could be the moment when impossible's new fangled meat goes mainstream. Impossible foods was founded in 2011 when Pat Brown, a longtime vegan, was nearing the end of an accomplished career in biochemistry. I've been astounding just my whole life and just came to this realization that by far the most important scientific question in the world is what makes me delicious? Pat Brown, someone call a zealot for his mission. He really doesn't hold back when it comes to talking about wanting to completely replace animal agriculture. So the most important thing to be able to do is to find the right way to produce meat. You've probably heard about the dangers of cow flatulence. The digestive systems produce large quantities of the powerful greenhouse gas methane. In fact, it's estimated that livestock farming is responsible for nearly 15% of all greenhouse gas emissions. In possible claims, it takes 89% less GHGs, 87% less water and 96% less land to produce its burger. The key, of course, would be to get people to actually eat the thing, which is where the company's secret ingredient comes in. Him, a genetically engineered substance with a bloody iron rich taste like red meat. The team is a very controversial part of the Impossible Burger. It's also what makes the Impossible Burger what it is. There are a lot of consumer groups and anti-GMO groups that oppose the Impossible Burger because of the heme. The studies on its safety are pretty short term, but the FDA has approved it and the company says it's completely safe. And there isn't any evidence that it isn't. Critics have also challenged the company's claim to health advantages over traditional meat, pointing out that while the Impossible Burger has less fat, sodium and calories than its beefy cousin, it's also more highly processed. But let's be real. We're talking about mimicking hamburgers here, not kale salads. These burgers are definitely better for the environment, so that's a plus, but they are not necessarily better for your health. After years in the lab, Pat and his colleagues were confident they had a product even Ron Sponson could love. And the impossible.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,710,2022-11-19 01:40:33
18097," Patton's colleagues were confident they had a product even Ron Sponson could love. And the impossible burger made its debut in 2016. Their burger began its life in the public when it was sold at David Chang's Mama Fuku. And they went from sort of higher-end find-dining restaurants into higher-end burger restaurants, like Bare Burger and Mommy Burger. And then suddenly they started popping up everywhere. It tastes like a burger. It tastes like meat. This is all meat from plants. All made from plants. This tastes like meat. Doesn't that just look like real meat? So meat-like. They always say it's what they say. It's what they say. It tastes like a burger. It tastes like... Yuckers. The foam is the world's relics. No, it doesn't taste like a burger. Opinions differed on the impossible burger's relative meatiness. But the debate itself was fantastic free advertising, helping to propel impossible into major chains like white castle. And then in the summer of 2019, into more than 7,000 burger kings across the US. To date, the company has raised over a billion dollars and a funding round in March valued the company at around four billion. But fake meat is a happening space these days and impossible faces some daunting competition. So I'm now for the stock of the hour. And that is beyond meat shares of the faux meat or plant-based protein company are soaring today. Beyond meat is also making a very meaty burger from plants. They're very non-GMO. They stress that all the time to differentiate themselves from impossible. It'll be much easier to genetically modify plant material to make it take on the texture and appearance and aroma of animal protein. But we won't do that. Beyond meat had one of the biggest IPOs of the year in 2019. So impossible, which is still privately held, has some catching up to do. But you won't hear Pat Brown knocking his biggest competitor. I wish them nothing but success. They have the same mission we have. The only rival we care about is the incumbent animal-based industry. Rivals or not, impossible and beyond certainly agree on one thing. The true prize isn't the American market. It's China. 27% of the world's meat is consumed in China compared to just 9% in the US. The Chinese population eats a ton of meat. They are a huge market. China is a really interesting case because they have long had vegetarian cuisine as part of their culinary culture. And whether they are looking for meat replacements is still an open question. What we found in our reporting is that some consumers are excited about them. It's just we don't know if it's going to be enough. To improve its prospects, impossible is developing a plant-based replacement for pork. Globally pork is the most widely consumed meat. It's almost 40% of all the meat consumed globally. Number one in Europe, number one in China. So if we're going to achieve our mission, pork is right up there. No word yet on when Impossible Pork will be available. This morning, growing concerns about the nation's food supply. From butchers to national supermarkets, supplies now limited and prices rising. The impact of the coronavirus on the price and availability of meat has given a boost to companies like Impossible Foods. Over the four weeks ending April 19, sales of plant-based meat increased. But Impossible has acknowledged some negative effects from the pandemic as well. This being a product that has primarily been served in restaurants, they took a pretty big hit with all the food service shutdowns, although the company doesn't want to say, you know, how much of a hit. They have, however, announced some new retail rollouts. Recently, they announced that they're going to be rolling out with crogr supermarkets. And that's big, that's great for them. The question of whether this is like a long-term sea change for these companies. I don't know. Just have to wait and see. It's safe to say Impossible stands.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,711,2022-11-19 01:44:50
18098," um, uh, sea change for these companies. I don't know. Just have to wait and see. It's safe to say impossible stands a slim chance of achieving its goal of replacing the entire meat industry. But it's early days for the science of plant-based meat, and it's not impossible that these products put one day contribute to a greener, more humane future. In the meantime, as the technology improves, we get to look forward to many more years of this. This is meat. No, this isn't possible. Yeah, that's what I thought. This is the meat burger. I like it better. It's not even close to a veggie burger or a tofu burger or anything. Wow, that is very, very much. Yeah. What are is a strategically important point on the map of Pakistan. It sits very close to Iran, actually, on the very southern coast. It's about a 10-hour drive west of Karachi, but it's only about an hour drive to Iran. The area is extremely poor. It's very arid. It doesn't have enough water. Electricity has been very spotty. One of the most surprising things about visiting Guadar is the high degree of security that is absolutely everywhere. There are armed guards that are required to escort foreign visitors everywhere you go because it is contested region because there have been militant attacks in the past. Despite all this, Guadar is a key part of the China-Pakistan economic corridor, also known as CPEC, the Crown Jewel of President Xi Jinping's Belt and Road Initiative. We will leave no stone unturned in ensuring that CPEC and all the projects under its umbrella are materialised in time and in full. So far, just one-third of all CPEC projects have been completed. In Guadar, none of them have been, and the promised improvements for local people like job creation and better infrastructure have not materialised. So what has China got to gain from developing this seemingly obscure city on the Pakistani coast? We have seen this movie before. An outside power comes into Pakistan. It spends heavily on big infrastructure projects. China is not the first to do it. Right after Pakistan became independent in the late 1940s, early 50s, the US was sending advisors into Pakistan to help plant economy. US was doing infrastructure projects there too. Those early projects helped the US gain Pakistan as an ally against the Soviet Union during the Cold War. The US has provided about $80 billion in aid to Pakistan since its independence, but overall the result is disappointing. One of the recent attempts was in the late 2000s, as part of the US effort to combat terrorism in Afghanistan. The number one item on that aid package was to build these high visibility infrastructure projects. So there are literally projects that the United States tried to do or Pakistan proposed to the United States in the 2000s during that period that have become Belt and Road projects. China is stepping into a gap which has been left by retreating ambition from the US. The Belt and Road Initiative is China's President Xi Jinping's signature foreign policy initiative.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,712,2022-11-19 01:49:10
18099," Gambit! The Belt and Road Initiative is China's president Xi Jinping's signature foreign policy initiative. Launched in 2013, it comprises an overland belt stretching through China, Central Asia, into Europe, and a maritime road stretching around Southeast Asia through the India Ocean and up past East Africa. So a benign way of characterizing China's Belt and Road Initiative would be infrastructure for influence. So when Xi Jinping announced the Belt and Road Initiative, shortly afterwards China designated Pakistan as its showcase flagship project. So the China Pakistan Economic Quarter was going to be the biggest and most important showcase for the success of the Belt and Road. Pakistan is in great need of infrastructure development. They wanted to create a railway, a highway road, all kinds of economic development that is intended to help Pakistan, and it's meant to provide jobs, 2.3 million jobs for Pakistanis. It's meant to provide a 2.5% boost to GDP growth. And China would gain economically as well. CPEC was intended to reduce oil and gas routes from the Middle East by thousands of miles, a way to cut overland into Western China instead of going around Southeast Asia by ship. Projects in Pakistan also provide Chinese state-owned companies with an additional market. Chinese workers have brought to Pakistan to build infrastructure and then take wages home. CPEC is also strategically significant for China and Pakistan. China wants to strengthen this relationship to counter their shared rival India. CPEC is both an instrument of Chinese power, as well as a test of Chinese power. If it succeeds, China will be demonstrating that it's able to do what great powers have not been able to do in Pakistan, including the United States. CPEC is a very important country. It's in Pakistan's Balochistan province, an area with serious electricity and water shortages. Balochistan province is actually populated by people who are of Baloch origin. There are different ethnicities. They speak a different language from the majority in power in Islamabad. And they feel as the poorest province in Pakistan, they have not sufficiently benefited from some of the economic achievements that the rest of Pakistan has had. That area is quite contested by the Balochistan Liberation Army. The people who feel that even Pakistani people have encroached into their territory. So quite a number of people are still staging attacks and they attacked the biggest international hotel in Guadar, shot up the lobby and killed I think five people. But this unsettled city is where the China Pakistan economic corridor is supposed to lead to. Authorities plan to develop Guadar into an international port city. Guadar port has an interesting history and an interesting location too. It's located in Balochistan. It's about 120 kilometers from Iran. Pakistan purchased this territory from Oman I think in the 1950s. And so for a long time Pakistan has had on its agenda trying to develop this area. Since the 70s it's wanted to build a port in Guadar. Actually approached the United States in the 1970s and tried to convince the Nixon administration to pay for a port. Even offered naval access if the United States was willing to pay for that. The US rejected Pakistan's offer. Concerned that the port would not be commercially viable. And would cause geopolitical tension. But in the early 2000s a Chinese company was awarded the contract to build the port and they completed phase one of construction in 2006. The port was then managed by a Singaporean government entity. In 2013 a Chinese port operator took over from the Singaporeans. In 2015 China announced that it will expand the port as part of the CPEC initiative. But five years later little has happened.

18100," that it will expand the port as part of the CPEC initiative, but five years later, little has happened. When you look out at the port, you can see it has only three births and all of them were empty. And the only ship that was in the port at the time was a Pakistan naval forget. And so it indicated to me that the port is not particularly operational for commercial purposes and a number of analysts have talked about the strategic importance in a military sense. If eventually China were able to use the port of Guadar as a military base. No one would be surprised if China did use it in that way. I don't think in the short term, like it is set up in Djibouti where it has a permanent base. I think it's more likely to use it as almost like a sort of forward based resupply option. Something it can use when it wants to. Other projects like building Pakistan's largest airport in Guadar and two special economic zones have been delayed. A 19 kilometer highway linking the port with the Macarang Coastal Highway in Balochistan is under construction too. Most of the people who live there and work there already are fishermen. They rely on access to the sea. The way that the highway expressed highway from the port was originally proposed to cut off their sea access. That was a real point of contention with the community. There have been some proposals to allow them underpass. It's still a little bit unclear how that is finally going to be resolved. Even if those projects are eventually built, there are serious questions about who will work there. There is a problem with manpower, of course, in Guadar. It's a very small city. One proposal has been well will just ship Chinese workers in from China and build lots of fancy housing for them. The first Chinese built community in Pakistan, a $500 million development spanning over 10 million square feet with over 60% open spaces. That kind of proposal is what makes a lot of the Pakistani local people quite upset. A Guadar based journalist expressed concerns to Bloomberg over projects like this. The journalist spoke anonymously for fear of persecution from the Pakistan government. These projects are creating jobs, but they're not really creating jobs for the local people of Guadar. They're not against economic prosperity, but they're against the development that leads them behind. Pakistan doesn't have the money to build these projects. It's gone to the IMF for its 13th bailout since the 1980s. By engaging in CPEC projects, the government of Pakistan has incurred more debts from China. Not only posing challenges for Pakistan, but possibly the international community, if Pakistan eventually defaults on its debts. But CPEC is still set to go on. Even if most current projects haven't been completed, the two countries have recently signed new projects worth $11 billion. Pakistan's Prime Minister said the country's economic future is linked with China. It's hard to imagine how the China-Pakistan Economic Quarter is going to be the game changer that the Pakistan government would like it to be. We're not seeing the economic growth of benefit from the projects that were set out and we're supposed to have seen by now. We're not seeing the job creation. Project delays accumulating debts commercial viability. These problems of CPEC are also typical of Belt and Road projects around the world. For China though, it's never the narrow accounting perspective that matters. It's the bigger strategic benefits. As China's dollars continue to flow, as China's concrete continues to pour, China's influence continues to increase.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,714,2022-11-19 01:57:55

The Cyberpunk 2077 story is very much kind of a story of everything that can and will go rock in game development. The release of Cyberpunk 2077 in December of 2020 will go down as one of the most disastrous game launches in history, and it instantly rewrote the narrative of its celebrated developer, CD Projekt Red. Larger studios with bigger budgets weren't able to create the same quality of open-world game. The inside story of the making of Cyberpunk depicts a process marred by unchecked ambition, unrealistic timelines, and a focus on marketing at the expense of development. When CD Projekt stock was at its high, it was the largest stock in the Polish stock market. Cyberpunk was supposed to be the biggest game of 2020. This was a game that was starring Keanu Reeves. This is a game that was from the makers of the Witcher 3. This was supposed to be the big temple release of last year, and for it to become such a disaster for so many people, I think, will have pretty far-reaching consequences. CD Projekt Origins are somewhat unique in the game's industry. In the West and Japan, the late 80s and 90s were dominated by games through the home console market, and characters like Mario and Sonic the Hedgehog were becoming household names. The same was not true in a post-Soviet and economically depressed Poland. Most games were done on PCs, and most games were copied and sold in small markets around the country. You could go to the market down the street in Warsaw and buy in cell CDs, and these you guys, Marchiniewinsky and Michal Kaczynski, decided they were going to start selling CDs, and they wound up striking a deal with the people who made a game called Baldur's Gate, which is the seminal role-playing game in the late 90s. CD Projekt, named for selling CDs, would move on from just reselling games to localizing Western and Japanese made games into the Polish language, but it wasn't until 2002 that the company would make its own game, The Witcher. The Witcher is a huge, huge series, huge fantasy series in Poland, and so it was a pretty big deal that these guys got the race to make the video games. The Witcher Book Series is a source of national pride in Poland, and a CD Projekt released The Witcher 2. The video game series would become an important economic symbol for Poland as well. The CD Projekt Red would become this behemoth of an institution in Poland, and they were really big in the Polish technology scene because they were getting more worldwide attention than most Polish companies do, and making a lot of money. And in 2011, when Barack Obama came to visit Poland, the Prime Minister actually gave him a copy of The Witcher 2. I confess I'm not very good at video games, but I've been told that it is a great example of Poland's place in the new...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,715,2022-11-19 02:02:19
18102," I've been told that it is a great example of Poland's place in the new global economy. But it would be the launch of the Witcher 3 in 2015 that would elevate CD Projekt Red from representing the best of Poland to representing the best of the game's industry. I mean really the thing people look for first and foremost I think is that the game is just good and Witcher 3 was just a phenomenal game. There's a level of just storytelling and emphasis on making every side quest count on top of the atmosphere, the dialogue, the character interactions, the different way stories can end. They nail that. Other open world games felt empty and enforced and the developers of them gave excuses as to why there couldn't be more rich story or interactions and the Witcher 3 blew them out of the water. CD Projekt Red was beloved. They were seen as a studio that was willing to make what the player wanted and to truly put in the love and effort required to make a high quality game that really connects with the people playing with it. And the winner for Game of the Year 2015 is The Witcher 3. The Witcher 3 would go into an over 250 game of the year award. But along with being a critical success for CD Projekt who is also a financial success. Estimates put the sales of Witcher 3 at around 28 million copies in 2019. A huge step up considering by 2014 the Witcher and the Witcher 2 had only combined to sell 8 million copies. And with two large expansions for the Witcher 3, CD Projekt also helped separate themselves from other AAA publishers at the time. And the game award goes, oh man I have to pay a micro transaction to them. That's so stupid that this has to hold on. I got this guys. Here we go. Other games and the most notorious one to do this was EA's Star Wars Battlefront 2. They got really aggressive on micro transactions in a game that already cost at least $60. You could have paid more if you bought the premium editions, but not only was it that they were being very aggressive and trying to get you to spend money, but you could actually get items that helped you win. Well, gamers kind of draw the line in the sand there and they don't like that. CD Projekt had done this phenomenal job of marketing themselves as a gamer friendly company. We've said this a million times and I'll say it again, we're gamers first of all and we all like to be treated fairly, so it only makes sense that as developers we apply the same principle to everything we do here at CD Projekt Red. So giving everyone a bunch of free DLC was an absolutely no brainer. They said we're not going to sell you DLC that's like horse armor packs and other nonsense. We're going to just give you free stuff and then we're going to sell big expansions as part of the Witcher 3. And not only were they really good, they were offered at a fair price. And this is a company that was seen as just like a company that really cared about quality and cared about its customers and would not do anything to kind of screw fans over the way that fans see that EA and Activision and all the other big publishers feel. With it critically and financially successful game, as well as the goodwill from the gaming audience, all the focus would shift to CD Projekt's next release, Cyberpunk 2077.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,716,2022-11-19 02:06:33
18103," It's actually funny, they first announced it through like a press release. And then they showed off a trailer of the beginning of 2013 that was like the CGI trailer of like a woman and there was all sorts of cool cyberpunk stuff flying cars lots of stuff. But it wasn't really until after the Witcher 3 that Cyberpunk began really like building up this fever level of hype. CD Predic Red though wouldn't put out another trailer for Cyberpunk until 2018 at the E3 trade show. And they showed off a, it was like a 2 minute trailer of Cyberpunk look pretty rad. And then they showed behind the scenes for E3 attendees for press and anyone else who could get a score and appointment in there. They showed this 45 minute demo and it blew people away. Welcome to the gameplay demo walkthrough of CD Project Red's upcoming title, Cyberpunk 2077. The gameplay you're about to see is from a work in progress version of the game. Everything you see is potentially subject to change. This if they can live up to what they showed me, it's game over. It all looked incredibly impressive. They had enough action, enough narrative beats with just the right amount of tension. They touted how each of these NPCs, their thousands of them, each one with their own daily routines and everything. We've greatly enhanced our crowd and community system to create the most believable city in any open world game to go. So yeah, so people were certainly blown away by this demo of 23 awards and just people left the theater just in awe. What they didn't know of course is that the demo was completely fake. Fake demos are common at E3. Studios put together builds of games to show off what they tend the game to be like rather than the actual state of the game. What was unique about this demo was that it was impressively long. It kind of plays into this idea that CD projects is very much a market and driven company and so demos were really, really important to them. So it was really important that they make this demo blow people away, which it did. But that might have come to the cause of like some time they could have been spending on the game. A year later, at E3 2019, fans will get another big surprise. Whoa, no way! Oh, what? He's welcome. The idea of being there, of walking the streets of the future, is really going to be breath-taking. You're a breath-taking. The Cyberpunk trailers showed gorgeous cities, beautiful lighting, really cutting-edge technology when it comes to the rendering of the game itself. People were very excited to be immersed in this gorgeous Cyberpunk world. They saw over 8 million pre-orders, which is a ridiculously large amount for any title to sell, let alone pre-sell. You saw the stock price start to go up and up and up and up into the right, pretty much in a straight line. If you just look at the Polish stock market, like the Wig Index, when CD project stock was at its high, it was the largest stock in the index. And that was around the time that they announced that the game would be coming in April of 2020. Behind the Seaheens, people were pretty shocked that they were saying April. I don't think a single person who worked on that game actually thought they had a chance of coming out in April of 2020. So in April of 2019, I published an article for Kotaku about the making of a game called Anthem, which was a game from Byware that was disastrous in many ways and the article ran through.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,717,2022-11-19 02:10:45
18104," In 2019, I published an article for Kotaku about the making of a game called Anthem, which is a game from Byware that was disastrous in many ways and the article kind of ran through why that was. Afterwards, I started hearing from other developers who had stories to share that they said sounded a whole lot like Anthems. The deadline is unrealistic, the direction keeps changing, things are floundering, we're going through a lot of problems. This sounds exactly like what you wrote about Anthem. Around that same time, perhaps coincidentally, I heard from the CEO of CD Projekt Red who wanted to reach out to me specifically to talk about Crunch. CD Projekt Red had a reputation for Crunch, especially during the development of Witcher 3. Their management wanted them to have a reputation for training workers well and not forcing them to go through Crunch. So Marchinavinsky, who's a co-founder and co-CEO of CD Projekt Red, came to me and said, hey, I want to make a vow right now that we're not going to force anybody to crouch, that people will not have to work mandatory overtime on this project. Over the course of reporting, Bloomberg has conducted interviews of more than 20 current and former CD Projekt staff, most of whom requested anonymity so as not to risk their careers. CD Projekt declined a comment on the process or provide interviews with a story. The company would end up delaying the game three different times, first pushing from an April 2020 release to September, then November, and once again to December 2020. In order to meet the deadline, the studio would scale down the size of Cyberpunk's main city, as well as canceling some features. And while those measures helped, developers still said they were under significant crunch, including one former audio programmer who claimed to work up to 13 hours a day, five days a week, and stating he had seen friends who had lost their families over this. This was not a big secret in the office that the game was not going to be ready. But a similar sort of thing happened with Witcher 3, and a similar sort of thing happens with a lot of games where they don't seem ready until suddenly everything just clicks. Some of the best games ever made, like we're created through this process. I don't know that it's the most efficient or the wisest way to make video games, but it's what a lot of people do. I think that management there has genuinely tried to change it or at least said they wanted to change it, but it has proven very difficult to change that when you make games in this one specific way. Game studios, some of them see crunch as part of their core culture that all of their games that they've made under crunch have been successful, so it must be a core element to the magic recipe for creating good games. And that's really not the case. We've run studies and seen that at eight weeks of working 60 hours plus, the output of a professional is the same as if they were working 40 hours a week. So chronic overwork degrades how effective someone is to the point where then it becomes negative and overworking them is just getting new less and less productivity. And so these guys, the People at CD Projekt, having made the Witcher 3, we're kind of riding on that high, you could call it arrogance or confidence or whenever you want to call it, of having made the Witcher 3. And I think that like having a certain level confidence can certainly be a good thing, but in this case it could also be dangerous because it kind of blinded them to the reality, which is that this game wasn't going to call us. So many pictures entertainment is reeling from what may be the biggest and most devastating computer hacking in Hollywood's history. Reckers attacked in waves, first crippling sony.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,718,2022-11-19 02:15:19
18105," in Hollywood's history. Hacker's attacked in waves, first crippling Sony's internal systems, then leaking five Sony movies online. Today, the U.S. government pointed the finger of blame directly at North Korea for the devastating cyber attack against Sony Pictures. Sony pulling the plug on the interview, saying it will not show the controversial comedy about an assassination attempt on North Korea's leader. Sony Pictures hacking was taken very seriously because it was an attack on the free world. What we have been building in terms of our civilization and our freedom and our ability to exchange information freely have been disrupted by a country that we knew very little about. North Korea has reportedly made attempts to steal COVID-19 vaccine technology by hacking pharmaceutical giant Pfizer. The Justice Department has charged three North Korean hackers over a wide ranging scheme that included the attempt theft of billions of dollars for multiple companies. Despite so many attacks blamed on North Korea, there was not much known about the people behind the hacking attacks. And my aim was to reveal who these people are and what they are like, what their operations are like, and what their dreams and fears were. My name is Sam Kim. I'm a reporter for Blue MIRG News and I wrote a story for Business Week about North Korean hackers. My story is about people who are sent from North Korea to countries like China, to hack for the regime, spy on enemies, and make money. North Korea's cyber abilities began about in the 1970s with a lot of students going to countries like Russia, China, and even East Germany to learn coding. It was aimed at improving the productivity of factories at home. But in some time in the 1980s and 1990s, the current leader Kim Jong-un's father, Kim Jong-un, thought that it would be a good idea to develop a team, an army of people who could hack for North Korea's military. So they began this team of basically hackers who would spy for the North Korean regime and also go out there and make hard currency for the regime. I think Kim Jong-un takes the hacking ability more seriously than his father. He also enjoys a bit of tech sadness as well. He's often shown traveling on his airplane where on the desk there's a Mac computer. He understands the importance of computers. He understands the importance of employing technology to improve productivity of his economy. North Korea is an isolated country with its economy pretty much dilapidated nowadays. It's been under increasing pressure and sanctions from the US and the international community, basically. They do not have the resources and money to build a kind of conventional weapons that other countries are able to build. So what happens is North Korea concentrates its resources on building nuclear arms and missiles, which exports called basically a symmetric weapons. It's the kind of weapons that gives North Korea an instant edge. Think of cyberhacking abilities in that context. It doesn't cost them much money, but if you have the right people and if you have the right training, you are able to cultivate an army of people who are able to penetrate into computer systems of other countries. And that's what North Korea is after. But if you consider the fact that there are only",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,719,2022-11-19 02:19:30
18106," systems of other countries. And that's what North Korea is after. But if you consider the fact that there are only about a thousand IP addresses in North Korea available and many of them are basically loaned from Chinese communications companies, you can kind of tell why North Korea is willing to send its hackers abroad rather than operate from within. What's the matter with operating from within? Well, first of all, it would mean that a lot of information would have to be coming in from the outside world, which could risk exposing the government and the people to whatever truth there might be about them. So they're sending their trained hackers to China and other countries where access to information is better. But at the same time, because these are allies, and also because they have their diplomats stationed in countries like these, like China, they're able to regulate and control these hackers better. Performally, North Korea denies engaging in hacking and describedankugations to that effect as enemy propaganda. It took me at least half a year to track down these people. It felt like a war of loose chase in the beginning, because a lot of the people like these are protected by the government in South Korea. But at the end, I was able to find a person who had pretty extensive ties to the North Korean defective community here. And then I was also able to gain access to the people who had actually done programming hacking from North Korea before coming to South Korea. And Jung is one of them. Jung actually is not a real name. I knew before meeting Jung that he was in his late 30s. But when I actually met him, he looked at least a decade older. He wouldn't open up. I mean, it took me, I think at least an hour to make sure that he would trust me enough that he would share with me his life story. When he was first sent to China, he was a student studying computer science at a university near the border with North Korea. And he came back and realized that there was a lot more to do in China because he had more access to information. And he asked that he'd be sent back to China. And there was also recruitment going on for people who would actually do coding officially, but really hacking from North Korea. So he applied and he got the job. Once he got to the border, he crossed by foot and from there he took a bus. And then when he arrived at the station that he would spend years in later, he learned that the three-story building in the heart of a city was actually provided for free actually by a Chinese man who had business ties in North Korea. There were actually two other people that I had met. They all said that they go on to this freelance website for programmers and clients from around the world would come and give them orders, give them jobs to do. Some of the jobs given to Jong were cracking open, commercially successful anti-virus programs. And once he was able to open that up, he replicated that program into another product which his client would repackage as a whole different product to be sold to other people. He also created what we now call bots. They are very popular online games, including lineage. He would create a bot that would just roam around without any supervision from the user and basically trade items without a user on that game. He would grow that bot on lineage and sell it for almost $100. Another defector said the money from clients was wired primarily via PayPal to account to control by minors because they were the only ones with...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,720,2022-11-19 02:23:47
18107," A woman here, you know, last time I checked the head of baby, he worked for a software company, ironically, an antivirus company. What keeps coming up in my head, even long after I spoke to these people, is there was one common thing about them, which was the sense of disillusionment. One day had access to outside information, one day were able to freely roam in the Internet. There was a spark. And once they realized that there is a discrepancy between what they think is really happening and what North Korea is telling them every Saturday morning, that's when the spark gets bigger. The little fire is what eventually drives them to decide to leave, even if it takes a huge risk on their lives. Step into the shopping center of the future. A world filled with exciting ideas. Since they started popping up in the 1950s, malls have been the quintessential American shopping experience. Useling temples dedicated to the wonders and excesses of retail, food service and entertainment, the rise of the mall coincided with the growth of the suburbs. The heyday of the malls really is the 1970s, sometimes referred to as the malling of America. They really thrived at providing some sort of public gathering space, some sort of social life, in addition to actually giving people places to shop. Over the past few decades before then, lots of developers were building malls, and it kind of coincided with the growth of highways. So as more people started traveling and interstate start being built, developers really wanted to put something to attract people to stop. Take a look at an average American mall today, however, and you'll see a very different picture. Closed stores and empty hallways became the norm in many malls even before COVID-19 delivered them another set of problems in 2020. So what happened? This is the story of the rise and fall of American malls.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,721,2022-11-19 02:31:39
18108," This is the story of the rise and fall of American malls. When malls work best, they survived and thrived thanks to their anchor stores. Those are the stores that are on the edges of the malls and that are outward facing to the parking lot. If you're a shopper, you're going to walk through one of these big, usually a department store. If you're thinking about macy's or sears or jacy penny, those are called the anchor stores. Once shoppers are done shopping there, maybe they wander to the middle part of the mall, shopping at the other apparel shops or even going to buy some food. But you really have to have a reason for people to shop in the first place. Because anchors bring in all those people, they tend to pay very little rent. Around 80% of income from mall owners come from the inline stores inside the mall. Over the past few decades, malls have been facing challenges from all sides. The first being, there's just too many of them. As early as in the 90s, the malls were beginning to compete with each other. We have a lot more retail square footage per capita than Canada. We have only seven times more retail square footage per capita than Europe. After the 2008 financial crisis lowered retail spending across the board, malls, and especially their department stores, also had to contend with a new challenge that was growing fast. malls started to suffer in the early 2000s with the rise of online shopping. Suddenly, they didn't have that captive audience who had to go to the mall to buy something. You didn't have to get up, get in your car, drive all the way to the mall, and then see a bunch of other people. You can just do it from the comfort of your own. Department stores overall have become less relevant over the years. Many have fallen totally off, and that's Sears, JC Penney. Several bankruptcies in this space have really hurt the industry. But as department stores go, so does the mall oftentimes. So if department stores start closing locations, that means they're usually leaving malls. This is the Green Briar Mall in Southwest Atlanta, Georgia. It's in many ways emblematic of the problems facing malls today. It's been there since 1965, so for more than half of a century, it's been serving this area of Atlanta that's predominantly black, and also as middle-class neighborhood. It started with anchor stores, that were department stores. So you had JC Penney, and then Riches, which was later bought by Macy's. So you had these two national chains. It had the first Chick-fil-A in a mall, like that type of format. So when you think about the history of malls, like Green Briar had the perfect template, but now Macy's will be exiting the mall, meaning that the mall will be left without an anchor, which is vital to attracting other shoppers to come into the stores. Green Briar, then because it's kind of an example or a test for all these other middleing malls across America about what do you do when these large department stores as a business decision on their and are trying to just stay in the high quality malls. How does a middleing mall survive? What's their next strategy? What kind of many levels of space for Citoranians is there? Let's just try out some symbiosis. Then let's just take a little bit of it. How does the premise explore the real deal is what they need? The worst solution comes from this, with those هذا finishing tables, Greenbrier is a textbook example of how closely the deterioration of the middle class in the US is tied to the health.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,722,2022-11-19 02:35:36
18109," Greenbrier is a textbook example of how closely the deterioration of the middle class in the U.S. is tied to the health of its malls. The median income for the surrounding area has reduced by $6,905 over the past 15 years to a total of $20,756 per year, and yet residents and store owners hope that Greenbrier mall will see better days. Members are made up of the people and communities that help fuel them. Greenbrier is still a place that people go to and cherish, even if on paper it doesn't have the elements that make it a thriving mall. A lot of the existing constituents and residents there feel in any respects that they worked hard their whole lives to be able to experience the American dream, the single family suburban house in a leafy yard near a big mall that had a great NACI's, they're very reluctant to see that taken away from them. Now that NACI's is gone, Greenbrier may try to take inspiration from what many malls were doing in the years following the financial crisis, focusing not on shopping, but experiences. That was a trend we were seeing in 2016 up into the pandemic pretty much. And by experiences I mean everything as dramatic as a water park or hosting concerts to have people want to come other than just to buy stuff. Having Instagramable moments, making sure your store is pretty that people want to take a photo and post it on Instagram or Twitter. Historically the mall has always been a place for teenagers. You like to hang out, see your friends and also kind of be seen at the mall and that hasn't completely changed like before the pandemic, about 95% of Gen Z's. So today's teenagers had gone to a mall in a three month period. So teenagers are still going to the mall and they've always been keyed to having thriving malls because they're coming into their spending power and once you win over teens hopefully you're really winning over a loyal customer for life. But thanks to lockdowns across the country, most malls at one point or another were shuttered in 2020. That means no one using the multi-billion dollar American Dream malls indoor ski slope. No one going to the King of Prussia malls indoor skydiving attraction. Basically, the pandemic gave malls what they didn't need, another problem. What would your net income or net operating income have been in 2022 without COVID and what is it now in a post COVID world? So our views is roughly 10% hit to net income over that period. That's Vince Taboni from the analytics firm Green Street Advisors which rates American malls from 8 a deed just like a report card. And if malls did have a report card they wouldn't exactly make honor roll. During the US, out of the 1000 malls in the country there are roughly 250 malls, we grade a minus or better. The B&C quality malls which is the vast majority of the malls by count, we think are on a negative trajectory and it's going to depend on a lot of the local dynamics, ownership, decisions around how much money to invest in the property. We'll determine whether this mall can survive as retail or so rapidly melting ice cube. While there have been a few bankruptcies among real estate investment trusts that own mostly B2D malls in the past few years, A malls really are doing just fine. Some of the most productive shopping centers in the country are super high end. So I'm talking about Bal Harbor shops down in Miami, Florida. There is Americana man has it in Long Island's Gold Coast, the Grove in Los Angeles. These are places that have all high end stores and have done quite well. A lot of that has to do with efficiency of their property, so their sales per square foot are really high. But also, they've invested a lot in their actual mall because it has to look beautiful. It has to have all the services that have to be used.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,723,2022-11-19 02:39:50
18110," Squarefoot are really high, but also they've invested a lot in their actual mall because it has to look beautiful. It has to have all the services that a wealthy shopper expects. So what will the future hold for less sought-after malls that can't revive their golden years? For many of these malls, it will mean closure and then hopefully conversion. If they can't get a new use to come in, it's expensive, but you can just demolish it. And there are still quite a lot of sites just sitting waiting. Amazon has been picking up more and more of those building their big fulfillment centers. Also, a lot of communities see this as an opportunity to redevelop, re-enhabit this dead mall. To help that community meet the challenges it was never originally designed for. The number one reuse of an existing mall is as workspace. It's actually pretty easy to just throw some carpeting down, cut a few more windows and turn it into office space. The sort of number two reuse of malls is either medical, healthcare or education. Lots of great examples of community colleges all the way down to elementary schools. Moving into malls, then the third strategy that I wish happened more is actually just demolishing the mall and re-grain it. Either reconstructing the wetlands that used to be there and that frankly we never should have built on in the first place or providing community parks and gardens. While most analysts say post-pandemic retail shopping could breathe some life back into the American mall, many are not long for this world. Depending on where you live it might be time to make one last visit, grab some food, do some shopping and say farewell. President Trump traveled to Utah today where he dramatically cut back the size of two national monuments in that state. When former President Donald Trump announced plans to scale back two national monuments in Utah, there was outcry from a lot of people. One company in particular. Patagonia really is a resistance brand. They embraced the liberal resistance against President Donald Trump and really put themselves at the forefront of that movement. In 2017 it sued the Trump administration for sort of slashing the size of these two national monuments in Utah that were kind of mechas for climbers. It's said at the time joining the legal fracas was both extraordinary and obvious. So the company's general counsel said it took exactly one email to the board to decide to actually do that. And the case is still out.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,724,2022-11-19 02:44:20
18111," Extraordinary and obvious to the company's general counsel said it took exactly one email to the board to decide to actually do that. I send the case is still out. Well, I think the only thing to administration that stands is lawsuits. We're losing this planet and we have an evil government and I'm not going to stand back and just let evil win. This year it got even more active, it changed its mission statement to quote, Patagonia isn't business to save our home planet. And then it manufactured these little tags on some of its clothes that if you flip them up, it says both the assholes out very implicit running up to the election and it launched a digital tool to help people find the polling place and on that digital platform it says both the climate deniers out of office again and again on the loop. This isn't the first time that taking a stand has paid off for Patagonia. The business which is now worth over a billion dollars was built on it. I couldn't care less about making more money but by doing the right thing it always ends up making more money. So is this all a strategy, a sort of premeditated strategy? Who knows? I mean Sean Art's been very vocal from the start and makes no bones about he calls himself a dirtbag climber and an accidental entrepreneur. So I don't think he's fudging this but what's important is that it's sort of a textbook marriage of philanthropy and profit. If you want to understand the entrepreneur study that juvenile delinquent because you know they're saying you know this sucks and I'm gonna do it my own way. Of course like every other teenage kid I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. When I was 16 years old I took off and drove across the country and went into the Wind River Range and discovered mountain. Patagonia was born out of Rockclimate Avantiunard's first business, Schuwenard Equipment which made and sold climbing supplies. The Bunchon Art was a blacksmith in the 50s and he started selling climbing gear out of the back of his car that was less harmful to rock faces. This is sort of the origin story of the company it's called itself the activist company, a activist company. Six months out of the year Avantiunard is a blacksmith. He makes mountain climbing gear. The other half of the year he climbs. In 1968 Avantiunard and four friends including Doug Tomkins the late founders of the North Face brand embarked on the ultimate road trip from California where they were based to Patagonia in Argentina. The mountains in a good mood, dazzling sun, calmer all day. If this weather holds they could be on the summit within days. This trip became the documentary about these friends who were hippies in the 70s climbing in New Samiti where the sport became a lifestyle and how these friends became pioneer of the outdoor industry. Shuunard moved from selling petons to polyester and in the 70s Patagonia was born. In 1973 Shuunard and his wife Melinda opened the very first Patagonia store in Ventura, California where the company's headquarters remained today. Melinda Shuunard was the driving force behind many of the employee benefits like on-site childcare that helped the company achieve an impressive 4% employee turnover rate. The retail and consumer product sector average is more than triple that at 13%.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,725,2022-11-19 02:48:33
18112," an impressive 4% employee turnover rate. The retail and consumer product sector average is more than triple that at 13%. I do think that Patagonia was a leader, one of the first corporations to take into account, you know, the human capital and make sure that their staff, all their employees were cared for in many ways, not just wages, but also they just cared about their people, and knew that that's a good business model. Patagonia began donating 10% of its profits to grassroots organizations in 1985. This later became the 1% of sales that Schu and Ad labels and Earth tax. I don't think it's for land three, it's rent for us, living on this planet. While Patagonia was creating the blueprint of how to be a socially conscious brand, it was also turning a profit. It even made Ink Magazine's list of the fastest growing privately held companies. So every time the company makes a decision to do something socially environmentally active, it is met with success, and that isn't lost on Schoenart or any of the other leaders of the company. The more money Patagonia made, the more it gave away under its philanthropic program. Between 1989 and 1991, the payroll grew by 40%. But trouble was on the horizon. I think for 1991, we are looking at a recession. The question is how deep that recession is going to be and how long will be in it. Sales fell flat and the bank called in the company's revolving loans. A company that prided itself on taking care of its own laid off 120 people, roughly 20% of its workforce. That was when we decided that we were going to start doing things differently. And we were going to start running the company as if it's going to be here 100 years ago. With a renewed sense of purpose, Patagonia was ready for what it called business unusual. It started with the costly move to recycle an organic materials before launching a clothing repair service to discourage fast fashion. And Patagonia's influence was growing. What was intended as Schoenart's philosophical handbook for employees became an international blueprint for sustainable business printed in term languages. What's interesting to me is that all this, I hate the term on brand, but it's very on brand. It really works for the kind of company he's created. It works for the kind of employees he's been able to recruit and retain. It all is very seamless in terms of the identity of him and the company and what it means in the marketplace. So over time, the company's mission and its marketing have become the same thing. The inflection point came in 2011, actually Black Friday, Patagonia took out a huge ad in the New York Times that said don't buy this jacket. And it sort of got into the nitty-gritty on, you know, the carbon footprint and the water footprint that goes into, you know, a piece of a peril like a parke. And at the time Schoenart said the best jacket for our planet is one that already exists. So the company at that time said it needed to address the issue of consumerism, which coming from a for-profit business hits pretty hypercritical. As the company encouraged its customers to buy less, its annual sales increased by almost 40%. The stance of this is hypocritical is loud and constant talking about consumerism in a critical light while very much being a part of it. Fast fashion is top on the list of environmental destruction and not just destroying the environment but impacting human health. They are in the fashion industry, they're clothing retailer and to come head to head with that is courageous. You're not only just trying to create a product that'll last but you're also educating an entire generation of people to understand that whole ideology that you don't need to change out our outfits. In 2014, Rose Macaria was appointed as...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,726,2022-11-19 02:52:51
18113," I understand that whole ideology that you don't need to change out our outfits. In 2014, Rose Macaria was appointed as CEO. During the next six years, she grew Patagonia into a billion dollar company while also scaling up its environmental goals and bringing a more political voice to its activism. Ivana had this model where he was basically saying you can have a great business, you can make quality product, but you can also do the right thing by the environment, by your employees, by your community. And that, to me, was like the most holistic vision of business that I'd ever seen. So right now, Patagonia has a team of about 20 people solely focused on activism and grants. And this all comes at a time in the past decade when consumers are paying much more attention to the social footprint of companies and where they buy their goods. So what's happened is all this is good business for Patagonia in the past 10 years. Revenue and profit at the company of roughly quadruple. It's private, but estimates are it does about a billion dollars in annual sales, which is sizable. And that's part of the reason why it's been such a fortuitous cycle. As it's ramped up its activism and become more vocal on these things, it's resonated with the market. As the company branched out into other areas, including adventure capital fund for environmental causes and sustainable food, revenue reached a new peak of over one billion dollars in 2017. But this was still small change compared to fast fashion heavywaste like Nike, $37 billion that same year. Patagonia's conscience hasn't always been reflected in its customer base either. Personalized vests have become the go-to corporate uniform. And the expensive price tag has helped the brand and the nickname Patagonia. It's expensive stuff, it's expensive apparel, and that is part of their calculus in terms of the activism, a lot of the more sustainable parts of the supply chain are there's a premium for organic cotton or sustainable down. The Patagucci label is a symptom of that. Patagonia products are very popular, of course with people who are active in the outdoors, but also with people who are not as active. For instance, people in finance where the Patagonia vests go to the office. Because of the image that the brand projects and so they have to deal with the fact, although they preach for the environment and want to stand for good, they're victims of their own success. Patagonia set sales records in the first three years of the Trump administration. Now, in 2020 things have changed. His COVID-19 brought the business world to a halt and the American people voted in a new administration. Patagonia appointed Brian Gellert as CEO. As far as its CEO transition goes, this one's happening quite strangely. There's no real budget for next year yet because of everything that's going on and all the uncertainty around that. Patagonia's new focus is going to be on forging a relationship with the Biden administration. It should be a more close relationship, but Gellert still has his guard up. During the Obama administration, they didn't always agree and he expects the same with Biden in the White House. They plan to bring litigation wherever needed against any government needed about the issues that they care about and that's climate change in the environment.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,727,2022-11-19 02:57:20
18114," Two by motorcycle......... Okay, you built this. So this is all. This is new synth.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,728,2022-11-19 03:02:06
18115," Okay, so you built this, so this is all. This is new since the pandemic. We assume Googlers would want more indoor outdoor options. I mean, it's so exciting. It's such a fun. It is. It is, but I would say the thing we're really excited about are these new buildings because we're building sustainability and everything we do. So really forward looking. Good? Okay. From one of the newest workspaces at the Googleplex in Mountain View, California, this is Bloomberg Studio 1.0 with Alphabet CFO, Ruth Porat. We're not far from her childhood home. Her father was a physicist at Stanford, her mother, a psychologist. She was graduating from Stanford herself and then earning a couple more advanced degrees. Porat landed her first job on Wall Street in 1987, where she would spend almost three decades until Google's co-founders lured her to Silicon Valley. It's wonderful to be here with you. It's great to have you here at the Googleplex. Thank you for having us. So we are at Google headquarters in Mountain View and at this very same time you are making massive investments in New York office real estate. You're expanding headcount in Atlanta and Chicago and Washington, DC. What's the strategy behind all of this? Well, at the core, we believe in hybrid work. So we do want to bring people back on campuses, but not full time. We're thinking it would probably be a three to work week, but we think coming together is just such a core part of innovation, serendipity, culture, every element of it. And we're growing it a really rapid clip. So we are excited to be expanding our real estate footprint. And then we also wanted to make sure that we're meeting people where they want to be. And so enlarging the number of sites that we have available for people in particular sites where you have great diverse populations. Sundar just told me that Googlers will have this option to work in a hybrid mode forever, like literally forever. Obviously, you're embracing this massive cultural shift. But what are the risks? What do you worry about? So the positive we've seen is there's a productivity uplift we believe in giving people the opportunity to be at home some of the time, not do the commute, be able to deal with everything else in their life, and coming into the office. So the risk is, I think, about my career, and so much of the benefit in my career was the informal coaching being pot-pron into meetings, all of the touch points that you have. And so I think that one of the most important things for all of us as leaders is we need to evolve the way we lead. We need to make sure that we're thinking about this hybrid work life and why that's the way to be the best magnet for talent and make sure that we're continuing to reinforce all of those great practices while opening up new great practices. Speaking of your career, before you were CFO of AlphaBat, you were CFOs Morgan Stanley and you started your career on Wall Street in 1987. Talk to us about the journey of going from big banks to big tech. Why did you make that leap? And what impact did you want to have? Well, I loved being at Morgan Stanley and I became CFO the day James Gorman became CEO, yes, needed to join him in that journey and that was January 2010. And we were still recovering coming out of the financial crisis. There were still some pretty rocky days and a lot of decisions that needed to be made. And then I got to a point where I felt like we were in a great spot at Morgan Stanley. And obviously, it continued to do really well. And I just wanted that next chapter. In my career, I've always been focused on continually learning and I feel like when you hit a plateau, the right questions, what's my highest and best use and it's been an extraordinary time. You also survived Wall Street in the 80s and 90s, which is notorious Boyz Club. And Silicon Valley has sort of come to be known as a Boyz Club of its own. How would you compare those two cultures? Well, when I was starting my career many decades ago, it was tough and much worse than it is now and it evolved. No question about it. Not where it needs to be, but certainly evolved and I saw it through my career. I would say the biggest difference out here.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,729,2022-11-19 03:05:55
18116," Now, and it evolved, no question about it, not where it needs to be, but certainly evolved and I saw it through my career. I would say the biggest difference out here is the level of impatience. And I love it. It's the view is if you can do some of the extraordinary breakthroughs that we have out here, if you can do natural language translation, everything we do with AI, with VR, with self-driving cars, why can't you fix this now? And that level of impatience, I think, is fantastic. Legend has it that when you got to Google, you were going to reign in the spending, tighten up on the moon shots. Your nickname, I believe, was Ruth Vader. Was that a tough job to take on? So I think the narrative was written before I got here. And what I find most interesting about that is I firmly believe the single most important thing in capital allocation is investing for long-term growth. I think if you don't, you are sowing the seeds of your long-term decline. And I learned that really early on in my career. Now if you're investing in an industry like this and trying to do truly transformative things, by definition, everything can't succeed. And so by definition, you should have the metrics and data and milestones to assess, is it working or is it not? Because if everything's working, or if you think everything's working, I would say one of two things are wrong. Either you're not reaching high enough, or you're not being honest enough with yourself about the pace of breakthrough, whether you're going to get there. So to me, a really natural part, kind of a sister organization to investing for long-term growth is actually thinking about how are you doing with the risk that you're taking, stack, rack them, and figure out what's at the bottom so you can redeploy those resources to the top. They go together, actually. And so I find the narrative, it's a false choice to think that it's either about growth or it's about pruning, stack ranking. They go together, and you have to think of them as actually empowering one another. You advised the Treasury Department during the Great Recession, what lessons did you take away from that? What struck me is a lot of the lessons from the financial crisis are relevant in good times and bad times. So the most important is it's easier to prevent than to fix, and so that was really clear during the financial crisis. The financial crisis was about liquidity, and it dried up quickly, and it would have been really easy six to 12 months prior to build in durable liquidity. You couldn't do it in the moment. And so this notion about really building a solid foundation on which you operate, you need to do that ahead of time. It needs to be all of the work we do on trust and safety and content moderation security. That is the foundation on which you can build everything else. The hangpaws at one point said to me, you have to have the will and the means, and too often by the time you have the will, you no longer have the means. His comment was, be decisive, act early, even in the absence of information. I think that's true in this whole notion of investing for long-term growth, because if you're not actually assessing progress along the way, and you just assume, you know we can keep investing in everything, at some point down the road, you'll say, I wish I had made those tough calls to double down on the things that really mattered. What times are we in now? What's your read on the economy today, especially with rising inflation? Well, I think back to March of 2020, and where we were. And I think of all of the intervention and steps that have been taken since then, and you've certainly seen the recovery coming out the back end. And it's been really gratifying from those painful days to see the breakthroughs that we've had not just on the medical front, but we've also seen the improvement across businesses. I think one of the biggest concerns, in particular, as you're seeing us, go through a digital transformation and the acceleration of it, is ensuring that everyone has the skills, the digital training and skills to thrive in this new economy. Google now reaches more than half the people on the planet. Why shouldn't we view Google as a monopoly? We often say that people come to Google not because they have to, but because they want to. We're opening the world for so many people, so that's the intent.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,730,2022-11-19 03:10:14
18117," Yeah. I want to talk a little bit about regulation. You were drawn to M&A in your early days at Morgan Stanley. Microsoft is making some big acquisitions, deals that some think Google maybe would have wanted to win in a former life, is antitrust scrutiny constraining any of your business plans and your ability to compete. So the main thing that we've done throughout our life of Google is really invest in innovation, its organic growth, and we're continuing to do that at a really rapid clip. We have then layered onto it, tuck in acquisitions and larger acquisitions, and we're continuing to be active, more on the smaller ones and the add-ons to be fair. But we think there's a lot of opportunity still ahead of us, and so we're continuing to invest in partnerships and in some acquisitions and do you think that there's still upside in a lot of different areas? So would you say this regulatory scrutiny isn't slowing you down? It's really important for those of us in certain leadership positions to be very focused on constructively engaging and working with regulators on what are the issues, what is it they're trying to solve and how can we constructively engage with them. At the same time, our engineers should focus on innovation and continuing to kind of up the bar on everything we're doing, address what is most helpful for our users. Google is facing more serious legal threats at this time in the United States than the other big tech companies. How are those conversations with regulators going? Are they frustrating at this point? Well, there's certain elements that are frustrating because I listen to the outline of some of the proposed legislation, and I think it's inconsistent with some of the priorities for public policy. So as an example, there are a lot of focus on what is called self-preferencing. Are you putting too many of your own products together? But during the pandemic, one in three small businesses said they would have failed without digital skills. Why? Because what they were able to do is connect with their users in different ways. So if you go search for a small business, you can then go to a map and you can get direct it to the small business, that's a good thing. We have 6,000 small businesses who wrote in and said, you know what, we need these digital tools and skills. Same with a number of things on racial equity. Real surge in searches about where can I, where's a black owned business near me and the ability to direct people through search and maps. So I think that what's really important, and that's why I said it's about constructive engagement, let's make sure we understand what they're trying to solve and work with them on what is it that we're trying to address through products so that the products are helpful in the ways that they want. Facebook has taken a serious reputational hit. Has that had ripple effects or created collateral damage for Google?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,731,2022-11-19 03:14:48
18118," are helpful in the ways that they want. Facebook has taken a serious reputational hit. Has that had ripple effects or created collateral damage for Google? Well, I think that whenever there's a backdrop that's challenging, it has ripple effects. But what we're really underscoring is all of the steps and investments that we are making to really protect the ecosystem the way we are commitment to our users. So we know how sacrosanct that trust is and it's all about privacy and what are the steps that we're taking to make. Privacy could protect it for users. What is it that we're looking at to protect content and content moderations? Google now reaches more than half the people on the planet. Why shouldn't we view Google as a monopoly? So I go back to the earliest days when Google, I first learned about Google, back in 1998. And in those earliest days, when I heard about this like eighth search engine, the question is why do you actually need it? And back at Morgan Stanley, it's working with our research analyst Mary Meekers. She actually had her team put up white pages all around the conference room and was doing this comparison. What provided the most responsive results most rapidly? And all of a sudden you could see, well, when did this Google thing actually maybe we do need something new? And that's been the ethos at Google since inception. It's just continued to innovate to make this eight never better experience for users. And so if we can if we can deliver on that, which is what drives people here, it's really opening the world for for so many people. So that's that's the intent. Facebook and Twitter are exploring digital currency. What is your thought on the crypto market? And is there a play for Google? So we look at it. There's nothing to comment on now. I think we're much more interested in blockchain and the underlying technology and the implications for the business and also for the way we can support our cloud customers. So certainly a lot of effort there. There's considerable chatter in the crypto universe that Web3 and the blockchain could circumvent the power of Facebook and Google and more. What do you think about the next frontier of the internet? At this point, I think there are a lot of different things ahead of us that are actually studyingly exciting that enable us to actually continue to address different needs and requirements. Like I look at for example in something like health where I think blockchain will be very valuable when you think about health and health records. There also a whole host of other areas where the data analytics that we provide are absolutely critical. Should we make excuses to our employers? Should we tell our like if I have to head to a parent to teach your conference or take a kid to the doctor, do I tell my boss that I'm not? You don't tell your boss. You've got to get over the guild.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,732,2022-11-19 03:19:08
18119," You survived breast cancer twice. What was your biggest fear at that time and how did you overcome it? Well, the biggest fear was I wouldn't make it. And I remember when someone at some interview while I was going through chemo said, where do you want to be in five years? And I froze because it was, I want to be alive. And I learned a couple of really important things. One, given breakthroughs in medical technology, I learned to love the word manageable. This journey does become manageable. Not for all cancers, but for many more cancers. And that gave me a lot of confidence talking with other survivors about it is manageable, get the best care. And just plow through it. I was just very grateful. I'm grateful for all of the investments people have made over the years, but for anybody out there. And I think everybody sadly will be touched by cancer either themselves or someone they know and love. Many of these cancers are manageable and just go at it with gusto. So that's what I did. You're a mom of three sons. And I find that especially remarkable because I also have three sons. How have you managed that over the course of this incredible career? How do you find that right mix of focus and free time to spend time with your family and doing the things that you love? So my kids give me energy. They're remarkable. And I think one of the important things for me is this notion that you do have to have a mix. It's not about trying to find balance, the physics of which is really challenging. I think when people try for balance, they always feel they're failing on something because something's out of whack. So this metaphor that life is like a kaleidoscope. And you need to have different shaped pieces of glass and different color. And sometimes one is larger than the other. And what's beautiful about life is when it's constantly moving around. And so to me that metaphor has actually been sort of an anchoring principle. The other is you have to put the kids first. So like they know that I'm there when they need always. And I think that just making sure that you're setting the boundaries the way you need to, I would say it's much easier today than when I was growing up in banking. We had a cubicle. There was a computer room. You were anchored to the computer room. One of the many beautiful things about going through this evolution in work is understanding that hybrid works. So how do we get rid of mom guilt? Especially in this new work world. I want to shake my mom guilt. How do I do that? Okay. So even when you feel it, just say, you know what? It's an investment in my career because I can stay in this longer and be operating at a higher level if I'm really getting the stimulus from all parts of my life. So you've got to drop the mom guilt and when on the other side mom guilt with kids, I think they get it. I think they understand what we're doing. And you know, they'll never forget during the financial crisis at one point I was working on AIG. We went around the clock. I came home to shower that one like right as we were landing AIG and my three kids had each written me a yellow sticky note with a message on it. And one of them was based, you know, the essence of which was I get why you're doing this. And they saw it as the right thing for the country. I don't need to over dramatize what it was, but that's what it felt like at the time. And that level of pride, I still have those three stickies right by my bedside because I get it. I get the mom guilt. I wish there were certain elements I could have done differently. But I also see the relationship we have and they understand what it means to actually be engaged in society and doing something you care about. No mom guilt. No mom guilt. Thank you. It's not allowed. Thank you. Should we make excuses to our employers? Should we tell our, like, if I have to head to a parent teacher conference or take a kid to the doctor, do I tell my boss that I want to hear?

18120," Should we make excuses to our employers? Should we tell our, like, if I have to head to a parent teacher conference or take a kid to the doctor, do I tell my boss that I'm doing? You don't tell your boss. You don't tell your boss. Guys don't tell their boss. So what do we say? I don't think you say anything. I actually made this point at an event at Morgan Stanley. I'm like, do not tell your boss. You've got to get over the guilt. The only way to move on from it is realize I'm a professional. I do things when I can. And it makes sense. And I get it all done. I just do it on my own timeline. And I actually had a woman who emailed to me afterwards and said, I know you said I'm not supposed to tell my boss. So I won't. But I can't not tell somebody. So I'm going to email you. And I'm like, OK, that's step one. I'm going to step five. Step attorney. Do not tell your boss. You're telling your boss, you know what? I need to do certain things for myself. And I'm getting, I feel guilty doing it. But I get everything done. There's no question. You are so beyond having to check in with people. Well, thank you. To not. We're in the middle of this so-called great resignation. And people are reflecting and changing and making big decisions. What's your advice to people in this big evolution? Huge choices ahead. Well, I think you framed it really well. I don't think it's the great resignation. I think it's the great reshuffle. And people are reflecting on what do they want and how do they want to work and how do they want to live their lives. So I think for all of us thinking about what does that mean for our institutions? It is about evolving the way we work, the way we interact, the expectations that we have to say, but I grew up in a cubicle on the 26th floor of a skyrise. It doesn't work anymore. And so what should we do as leaders? And I think that our, this generation appropriately, and it's very exciting, expects more from all of us. And so it's not just in how we work, but it is in what we do. And I think all elements of what's the mission? Are you delivering on the mission? Is really important. OK, so if you rapid fire questions, someone you'd love to have dinner with? Well, I'd love to say my parents, because they passed away in over years ago. Favorite family ritual? We do this crazy thing that we've done for years, which is everybody gets to pick where we travel. We come up with the five different locations, and then we all vote, and then we get the grid. And that's where we go. What's your favorite getaway? Probably, I would say maybe Iceland was the vast. That's an amazing one. New York or California? Ooh, so unfair. Well, sitting here outdoors right now, and knowing I can do that for the rest of the years for you guys, for the energy from New York. So I'm not going to, it's like, I don't pick amongst children. So, in closing, Google is a massive company, multiple divisions, many bets. Where are you spending most of your time now? I'm spending most of my time on your very morning question about capital allocation, because if it really goes to this core point, you've got to invest for long-term growth, and making sure that you're investing with the right intensity, I often say, I don't want to get to the two-yard line, but not score. So you need to make sure you're investing with the right intensity to support long-term growth. That's the most important area where I would say I spend the bulk of my time. And then, of course, you have to prioritize in order to recycle to support those efforts. What kind of discussions are you having with Larry and Sergey now about this next phase of Google? So when they made the announcement about the role of change, they were very serious about moving to this board role, and they're amazing board members. Sundar, of course, relies on them for counsel wherever whenever, but most of the interaction is really around what are we doing at the board level? It's been great. And you have your freedom to allocate capital as you like. I work closely with Sundar and Phil and Thomas. Yes, we work as a great team. So what's the vision for Google then 10 years from now? It's fascinating to, I think I have the same reaction you do when I heard Sundar say search is the biggest moonshot. And I think that continuing to find ways to be helpful to users to solve what they need where. So many people are coming online, and it is video going to be the way they understand it's going to be about search is going to be a different type of experience.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,734,2022-11-19 03:27:41
18121," Where so many people are coming online and it, you know, is video going to be the first, the way they understand it's going to be about, you know, search is going to be a different type of experience, so much of it's going to be about voice first and language translation. So there's going to, it's going to continue to evolve. And what about for you personally? Where will you, you know, it's been so amazing to hear about your journey and I'm just curious about your personal growth. Like, what you feel you've accomplished in the last, you know, since you've been here and what you hope to accomplish. I find that the opportunity to try new things and to invest in new things and as we think about, well, what does that mean for each one of our areas? There's, I think that intellectual curiosity keeps you young and I think that continuing to learn is like your brain is like silly putty getting pulled in a lot of directions. So to me, it's continuous learning. Ruth Porat, thank you so much for joining us. It's been wonderful to be here. Thank you. To have you on campus. Thank you. Thank you so much for doing this. Well, thanks for doing it. Of course. So, sorry I'm late and I'm coming late. Not at all. It gave us more chance to tweak the lights for the 50,000s times. So. You're doing well? Yes. How often are you coming into the office these days? About two to three days a week. Yeah. How about you? I guess you come in. Yeah, I'm in every day now. So no more kids on the set. And ask, is your son still mining Ethereum? He and I literally were talking about it last night. He's like that. You were the one who made me give up on it. I'm like, no, I didn't. But yeah, the thing that's good about this is I think it excites a whole new generation about technology, which is good. I really appreciate taking this time. Well, thank you for doing it and thank you for coming down to do it. I'm ready to go in you guys are. From Google headquarters in Mountain View, California, this is Bloomberg Studio 1.0 with Alphabet CEO Sundar Pachai. Gordon raised in India, Pachai had almost no access to a computer until college, but just years later found himself rising through the ranks of the world's largest search engine. In 2015, it was Pachai that Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin chose to run Google and later Alphabet. Now valued at more than $2 trillion, it's one of the most powerful companies on the planet. Sundar, it's great to be with you today. Thanks for doing this. Great to be here in person. Google just hit a $2 trillion market cap. Alphabet, I should say. Where is the next trillion dollars going to come from? You know, I've always felt, you know, your market cap valuation is an effect of the value you provide. And I feel fortunate our mission is timeless.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,735,2022-11-19 03:32:04
18122," You know, your market cap elevation is an effect of the value you provide and I feel fortunate our mission is timeless. You know, there is more need to organize information than ever before. I still feel searches are biggest moonshot as a company. You know, people will want radically more conversational experiences. They will want what we call multimodal experiences. They may speak to search. They may look at something and ask what what the information is. Being able to adapt to all that and evolve search will continue to be the biggest opportunity. We are so excited about the YouTube cloud or hardware products Google play. So we're building a diverse set of businesses. But underlying all of it is the investments we are making in AI. You know, we've invested 100 billion dollars in R&D in the past five years. And so applying AI in a deep way is probably where we will create the biggest opportunity ahead. Microsoft is making some big acquisitions. Apple's anti-adtracking technology is shaking up the industry. What do you make of these competitive moves? Your competitors say they're on the right side of history. Are they? I look at the fact that there are three billion people who have access to knowledge of their fingertips. I look at the opportunity we provide. I look at the skills people are learning through YouTube. You know, I feel that everywhere when I go talk to people and and providing access to information and knowledge. I think we'll end up being on the right side of history as well. Your predecessor, Eric Schmidt told me that he feels the latest Facebook revelations are disturbing. Google also has access to massive amounts of our data. Why should half the world's population more than half the world's population trust Google to do the right thing? We are trying to do more with less data. One of the biggest changes we made was making order delete the default setting for new users signing in. And now over two billion users have their data continuously being deleted. Look, we rely on trust for people, you know, every day when people come to Google. You know, they place their trust in us and vulnerable moments. Maybe a health issue on which they are trying to understand. There is no more important responsibility we have than doing right by that trust. You know, when when we provide Gmail to journalists and realize that their accounts may be under attack by an authoritarian government. I mean, that's what motivates us to make sure be privacy be security be trust. We are doing the right thing over time regulation will have an important role to play here. I think privacy regulation is important in areas like AI regulation will be important. And so I think, you know, those will be part of the answers as well. The Facebook follow out that Instagram can be toxic to teens, for example, has this raised more or new concerns for you about the impact of technology, tech addiction, algorithms, YouTube even on our children and their development and their mental health. I mean, you're a parent and you also have a lot of power over how this plays out. You know, I mean, like you, you know, bringing kids up in this modern digital world is something I think all parents are anxious about rightfully so. I think, you know, it's part of why a few years ago when in YouTube, you know, we were exposed to a set of concerns. You know, we invested it became the number one priority to work harder. The reason YouTube invested so much in developing YouTube kids as a safe destination for young children, so on. The technology is going to play a big role in helping give children the next wave of opportunity as well. So the answer is to develop it responsibly. We have changed our balance in these areas and saying, we think about content responsibility first. And then the pace of development or new features in areas like YouTube. And so that's how we approach it for a while. Facebook and Microsoft are all in on the metaverse. What do you think about the metaverse? What's Google's metaverse strategy? It's always been obvious to me that computing over time will adapt to people and people adapting to computers. You know, you won't always interact with computing in a black rectangle in front of you. But just like you speak to people, you see and interact with computers.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,736,2022-11-19 03:36:15
18123," just like you speak to people, you see and interact. Computers will become more immersive. They'll be there when you need it to be. So, we've always been excited about the future of immersive computing and being computing AR. And we are in... Is that count as the metaverse? Is that what that is? You know, metaverse is... I think it means different things to different people. The way I think about it is evolving computing in an immersive way with augmented reality. As part of that, there'll be many experiences, some of which will be immersive, interactive virtual worlds, you know, which is the metaverse concept. But I think this doesn't belong to any company, right? I mean, this is the evolution of internet and the web, the internet. All of it will continue to evolve. Google was famous for its campuses, where you could go and never leave. You had everything you ever wanted. Now, you've said they can be flexible. They can work from home. They can work at the office. They can be hybrid. They can work remotely, permanently, perhaps. Are you committed to really letting them do this forever? And if so, how does that change the future of work and society? Look, we've really embraced the fact that the future is going to be flexible. At Google, we've always tried to give, you know, agency to our employees. But we do realize the importance of bringing people together, the creativity community and collaboration that comes with it. So the balance we are striking is, is this notion of three two. And what we're giving, the strength of our companies, we have more locations than most of the companies. So we're giving people a choice to move anywhere in the world. Four weeks take and work from anywhere. We're going to accommodate 20% of our workforce to be remote over time. So we're going to embrace that flexibility and forever. Forever. Yeah. And, you know, we're committed to it. Through it all, it forces us to design better products. And since people use Google workspace to run their companies, I think gives us a chance to innovate and bring all that out. You know, I think there is so much value in giving people more flexibility between their personal and professional lives. And I think it will lead to people being happier. And I think companies can be successful in that model. And so we are trying to get the best of both worlds, but embrace the flexibility and see where we go. How confident are you that when you look back, you'll be able to say Google did enough to help save the world. We are putting so much energy and resources into it.hart, right now, I am actually the Head and Head of Mon avaient. You grew up in India, you lived through droughts, water was scarce. How has that experience shaped your feelings about the urgency of stopping climate change?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,737,2022-11-19 03:40:54
18124," India, you lived through droughts, water was scarce. How has that experienced shaped your feelings about the urgency of stopping climate change? You know, I grew up in Chennai, India, and a big part of my childhood was, you know, really pretty severe water scarcity. You know, we would get water trucked in for the streets and stand in lines and carry a few buckets of water at home. There was no running water for many years. And, you know, but fast forward a few years ago, you know, Chennai had one in a hundred-year flood, you know, which was a very extreme event. Kind of drove home. That combined with a few years ago, waking up to the orange skies here in the Bay Area, seeing the look of concern on my children's faces and having to explain it, you know, all kind of drove home in a deeply personal way for me. So I think it's the most defining issue we all face and, you know, definitely something very motivated on working towards. I remember waking up to those orange skies too and having to have that same conversation with my kids. Do you think the commitments at COP26 went far enough? You know, encouraged by many things, you know, we have to tip our hat to the people who are working super hard. The issues and the trade-offs are genuinely difficult, you know, you have to keep the economies growing, you know, it really matters. And but at the same time, it's a pretty severe urgent issue. So I'm encouraged by the progress, I think it builds on the Paris Agreement. So I can see the forward progress. There is a deep anxiety that it all may not be enough. But, you know, we have to be optimistic and keep pushing. Google has set some aggressive targets to run entirely on clean energy, to be the first tech giant to do so 24 hours a day. How confident are you that when you look back on this time, let's say a decade from now, you'll be able to say Google did enough to help save the world. We are putting so much energy and resource into it. It's always been kind of a founding value for us. We've been carbon neutral since 2007. We've been matching our energy consumption with renewable energy over the past few years. So this, you know, we are now pushing, it's a moonshot to be 24, seven carbon free. That means every search you do, every email you send, that we can do it carbon free. We were at 61% in 2019. The number is now 67%. We have set our goals to be 100% by 2030. And to do it globally, that means we have to solve the new things which we haven't done before. Wind and solar alone won't be enough. We just started geothermal in Nevada. We will be investing in newer technologies, including carbon capture, et cetera, over time. So that's what excites me. We are a technology company at heart. So part of, there are many answers to this problem. Some of it is that we are going to have to innovate our way out of it. And, you know, we want to push as hard as possible in doing that. Our Bloomberg New Economy Forum is happening this year and seeing a poor. And the Asia Pacific region is one of the fastest growing internet economies on the planet. Where do you see the most room, the most opportunity for Google to grow there? You know, it's such a feting time frame. You know, glad you're focused on the region. It's the most vibrant region we see. It's our 20th year since we opened our office in Tokyo. It was the first office outside the Bay Area. You have two and a half billion people on the internet. There are many areas in which they are leapfrogging, trends which are here, and embracing the future. Digital payments is a great example. So many of our products originated from APAC, Google Maps, Google Pay. A lot of our journey to bring computing to more people is playing out in Asia as well. I am excited about also the work we are doing through cloud because the companies that are rapidly transforming themselves digitally. So a chance to provide that is something very exciting for us. So super dynamic region, I feel like we are learning as Google, being in the region. And so I think it will transform. The first 10 years, I would have said we took products here and brought it to APAC.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,738,2022-11-19 03:45:01
18125," as Google being in the region. And so I think it'll transform. The first 10 years I would have said we took products here and brought it to APAC. Over the past few years, we're beginning to build things there. And some of our future global products will be APAC first and rest of the world later. You can't talk about APAC without talking about China. And you're facing stiff competition from Chinese tech giants there and beyond. What should US policymakers know about competing with China? There's a lot of conversations about US and China, the competition is fierce. Many of the areas like AI and quantum computing where we are investing a lot, Chinese companies are neck to neck. What I think about was encouraged by the news coming out of Glasgow, about the US-China agreement on climate. To me, while we talk about all the areas where we are competing, some of the biggest areas which are common challenges for all of humanity. The pandemic was one. AI and AI safety over time will be a shared one. Obviously sustainability is another area like that. So I think these are all areas in which the countries can come together. And so I think that's a way by which we think about as when we compete on the internet and there may be different visions of how the internet plays out. So I see opportunities both sides. What are the chances that Google search will ever come back to China? Or that Google Cloud would ever come to China? Today we don't provide most of our signed-in services in China. And I don't see that changing. But there are ways, as I said, in areas like AI or sustainability. I think there'll be opportunities for us to work together. Through Cloud, we will support multinational companies, which have presents everywhere. And so maybe there are opportunities to work that way as well. AI is advancing at an astonishing rate. And it is hard to understand sometimes what this really means. In concrete terms, how will our lives look different? Let's say 10 years from now as a result of AI. You know, done correctly. In many ways it's going to be helpful to you. You'll take it for granted. The same way today, for example, in India, over one-third of the queries on many phones come through voice, but it's something people take for granted, you can do it. So over time, you'll expect to speak and be able to understand any language in the world. And those are all ways it's going to make it better. You may go to a doctor's office and go through a scan. And the system may be prioritizing for the radiologist so that they don't miss some important things, maybe giving them a second opinion. So these are all ways in which it will seamlessly start playing a role. And I think we'll see that if it's a fact. You mentioned if done correctly. And there are concerns. There are fears that AI will replicate the worst of society, even under Google's own roof, from your own researchers. What scares you most about AI? What keeps you up at night? It's the most profound thing we are working on as humanity. And any time you're developing technology, there is a dual site to it. I think the journey of humanity is harnessing the benefits while minimizing the downsides. The good thing with AI is it's both going to take time. I think I've seen more focus on the downsides early on than most of the technology we've developed. So in some ways, I'm encouraged by how much concern there is. And you're right, even within Google, people think about it deeply. We publish a lot of research. I think it's more important that there are outside academic institutions, governments, nonprofits looking at this issue as well. So I think it'll be an issue which will have a lot of attention, which gives me a lot of comfort as well. You said you'd pick up some new hobbies in the pandemic. What did you start? Cooking pizza, this learning cook, which I was never good at. It's a bit harder now, a little bit better.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,739,2022-11-19 03:49:19
18126," '' MUSIC You have presided over Google through massive social movements that reverberated in and outside the company. What have you learned as CEO since the walk out? For me, you know, it was a moment. I think it changed the company for the better. You know, we've always been committed. It gave us an insight on what more we could do. We undertook deep commitments. And the biggest, you know, overall and diversity and inclusion. I think if you're committed and you actually put in the effort behind it, you can make a difference. Now we have stated clear goals. We are on track to meet those goals. But it forced us to think about new answers. So for example, you know, tech companies used to talk about the pipeline problem. But you we are now going to places where the talent is. We are working much harder. So going to Atlanta, going to DC, going to Chicago, going to New York. That's improving our diversity and representation at all levels. The war for talent is even more competitive now in this new world. What are you offering? Elon Musk has said big tech is a place where talent goes to die. How do you respond to that? Okay. I look at the fact that, you know, we are looking to hire 30,000 people next year. I look at the impact we have on many people coming and working. And we are looking at the impact we have on the latest cutting edge things. And many people come in, people leave Google. We are proud of people who have left Google that are, I think that are over 2000 companies that have been started by whom we call as Zooklers. I'm equally proud of that. Right. I think we are one part of a big big system. And, you know, I think I think I'm proud of the role we play in bringing in people. It's a great role of that, right? It's a great role. We have a great role. And I think that's a great role we play in bringing in people who are over time and outside world. All right. That's most of the heavy stuff out of the way. We're going to do some rapid fire just to get to know you a little bit better. You said you'd pick up some new hobbies in the pandemic. What did you start? You know, pizza, cooking pizza, just learning the cook, which I was never good at. Okay, Squid Game or Ted Lasso? I watched both, so Ted Lasso is much more common. And so I'd rather take Ted Lasso over Squid Game's any day. I know you're a voracious reader, so what's the last good book that you read? You know, I've been on a podcast bench, so a lot more podcasts than books nowadays. Okay, favorite videos you watch on YouTube with your kids. A lot of music videos, music videos. This whole notion where creators are watching other things and commenting on it. It's a trend which my kids are really into, and I've kind of gotten used to it now. So, you know, watching other games, it's a phenomenon. Screen time policy that's worked for you as a parent. And what's the-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,740,2022-11-19 03:54:22
18127," to and I've kind of gotten used to it now. So, you know, watching other games, it's a phenomenon. Screen time policy that's worked for you as a parent. And what's not worked? You know, I've kind of given agency to my kids. The only thing I tell them is that I can look at their digital well-being once in a while with them. And so. How do you do that? I asked them to show it to me and they show it on their phones. So, you know, so that's pretty much the only thing. So beyond that, you know, it's agency and, and, you know, talking to them about it and making sure we are spending time doing other things. And making sure they develop good habits, basically. Metaverse or real world? Done correctly. You know, you shouldn't feel the need to make a choice. You know, you always want to be present in the real world. And when you feel the need to do something, you want to do that. But, you know, I do think presence and the realness of the real world will end up matting for humans for a long time. Do you own any crypto? I wish I did. I've dabbled in it, but, you know, in and out. In and out. OK. Larry and Sergey, I'm not going to make you choose. How many times a week do you talk to them? I talk to them regularly. You know, it kind of ebbs and flows. You know, and so there are times we get excited about something and we spend a lot of time talking it through, but it depends on, you know, what I mean. A piece of advice you wish you had in your 20s. And a piece of advice you wish you had in your 40s. 20s would be, you know, being patient. You know, I think when you're young, you're very impatient, which is a great thing. But sometimes you do amazing things by slowing down and being really focused and doing it over a period of time. And so I would advise the younger version of me to be more patient. Maybe at 40, I would say, you know, when I look at climate, you know, I want all of us to be impatient. So, you know, I feel like when there's an urgency towards something, I think the world needs to be impatient. So that's that advice I would give to a older version of me. How much do you personally wrestle with the decisions that you have to make? And how much longer do you see yourself being the CEO of Alphabet, not just Alphabet, but also Google? Yeah. On the first one, there are moments we all have to make tough decisions and, you know, and some decisions weigh on me. And, but I, it's a privilege to do it. I have very good people helping me think things through. So I think the combination makes it all fine. On the second thing, I am, look, I'm so energized by the things we need to do. You know, I didn't have much access to computing growing up. It changed my life a lot. The one laptop or child goal really motivated me to come into technology. And when I look at last week, us launching a affordable smartphone in India, the chance to bring the next billion users in Asia and in Africa online, that gives me a lot of energy. Well, we'll be watching from afar. Sundar Patai, thank you so much for joining us. Thanks, and we wish you a good day. Thank you. Thank you. How ever you get your news.

18129," One of his longest tenured lieutenants, but the architect of Amazon's multi-billion dollar cloud business, Amazon Web Services, a moonshot that helped transform Amazon into not just e-commerce, but enterprise juggernaut. Jassy then needed to find his own successor, tapping a former colleague who helped grow AWS in its earliest days, but had since left to run Seattle software giant Tableau. His job to continue the reinvention of AWS and in turn, Amazon. Joining me on this edition of Bloomberg Studio 1.0, new AWS CEO, Adam Salipski. You worked for AWS for 11 years and then went on to become CEO of Tableau Software in 2016. Then you get a call from Amazon to come back and run AWS as CEO. Tell me about that call. Well, I was having a one-on-one at my prior company and my Apple news alerts went off like everybody else's did and it's at Jeff Bezos, who's taking on a new role and Andy Jassy's taking on the CEO role of Amazon. Of course, Andy and I worked shoulder to shoulder about 20 feet apart for 11 years. Of course, I reached out and congratulated him and we started talking. You know, the conversation turned to some of the possibilities and next thing I know a little while later. Here I am back at Amazon, absolutely delighted and honored to be the CEO of AWS and helping to shepherd this amazing business for our customers. In that process, did you talk to Jeff as well? Yeah, I had some communication, but it was principally with Andy who of course was, you know, the AWS business best and of course, it was taking on the CEO role. But yeah, there was contact as you might expect with a small handful of other people. So what did Andy tell you he wanted in the next chapter for AWS? Andy reminded me, not that I needed reminding, but that it has really still day one for AWS and for our customers. It is still so early in this business and we shouldn't think that just because the business has grown rapidly or just because we're currently the leader in the cloud, that it's anything close to mature. And so he really reminded me that we have to stay hungry, innovate as quickly as we ever have done in the past. You're about half a year into the job. What changed while you were gone that surprised you? Well, I think that so many more customers have really adopted the cloud and really decided that they're going all in. So I mean, it was a pretty decent sized business when I left, but it's really grown and the customer base is really expanded. And so now we have very deep relationships at the CEO level, the CIO level across every country, every industry, every use case, and we're regularly interacting with the most senior people at our client organizations. So you were working at Real Networks in the early 2000s and I understand you were offered a job at AWS without even really knowing what it was. I guess AWS was in stealth mode. Well, it was very secret. So it was hard that the company didn't want to talk too much about it, but of course, we had to talk a certain amount about it. So the call I got went something like, we have this initiative to turn the guts of Amazon inside out and expose it to other people. And it sounded intriguing, although I confess I didn't fully understand what that was all about. So I came in and started talking to Andy and a few of the other senior leaders and eventually to Jeff. And I would have to say that even by the time I took the job, I thought, I'm not going to be able to understand what they're talking about. And it sounds like a good idea. And I'm in. But I also was like, well, we'll just have to see how it goes and Amazon's a big, big place. And so I think we got a lot of intent to succeed here. And that's the thing that impressed me was Amazon really had the desire and the intent and the belief that this could be a really good business. AWS comes out of stealth mode and is the first to market with a cloud infrastructure service in 2006. How important was that first start? And do you think AWS still has an advantage today because of that? I think the time to market advantage that we had, which was probably honestly five to seven years, head start before other companies really started.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,743,2022-11-19 04:06:44
18130," the time to market advantage that we had, which was probably honestly five to seven years, head start before other companies really started to take this seriously, and frankly, it was just one of the biggest things that happened to us in the early years. Because at the beginning, a lot of people didn't get it. I would get asked a lot in 2006. So what does this have to do with selling books? And I didn't have to slide with kind of a pile of books on it and a question mark next to it. And the answer was, it has nothing to do with selling books. But the technology which enables us to sell books, being global, being at a massive scale, being secure, being low cost, being highly performant. All that technology has everything to do with offering these types of services externally. Now, AWS isn't a scrappy startup anymore. And you do have big rivals, even though AWS is still the leader, Microsoft and Google are big rivals. How do you make sure that being big doesn't slow you down? It's a great question. We are currently the leader. And I mean, depending on which third party you look at, we're probably a little bit more than twice as big as number two. And it's really important to continue to act as if we're insurgents and to be insurgents and not to start to act like incumbents. And I like to talk about actually managing the business. We want our senior leaders to be managing product and managing customers. And I think as you get bigger and you put more and more layers into your company, it's all too frequent that you start managing math. You start managing ratios and percentages and growth. And I think it's a real disease if you stray away from really focusing at a deep way on the product you're building and at a deep way on what your customers are telling you. And so we try and organize both with our org structure as well as just with our culture and what we choose to focus on. I'm really making sure that everybody is thinking about one or both of those two things, product and customers. And if you keep even the most senior leaders engaged at that level, then all of a sudden, you maintain the urgency and you keep acting like an insurgent. We got to feel that urgency every day. So keep acting like an insurgent. That's the motto. Absolutely. And structure yourself and build a culture that allows you to. It's one thing to say it, but it's easy to say it. But it's much harder to put in place enabling mechanisms that enable you to do so. And we focus a lot of effort on those mechanisms. Now, do you think the cloud keeps getting bigger? And that AWS and Microsoft and Google just get bigger pieces of an ever-expanding pie? Or at some point, does it become a zero-sum game? And that fight for market share becomes more brutal and more bloody? Well, I mean, this is a very large market segment. If you look at global IT spend, it's in the trillions of dollars I've seen estimates like $3 trillion. It doesn't really matter how many trillions it is. It's very, very large. And we've always believed that this was too good a market segment opportunity for the really to only be one winner. And sure enough, you've seen robust competition emerge. And we all compete vigorously. But it is. The segment is just growing so rapidly that I think really for us, we believe that the winning business strategy for a long time to come and I would maintain forever is to focus not on the competitors but to focus maniacally on customers and wake up every day understanding exactly what it is that they need us to build next and then work backwards from there, back internally to how can we build those things. And if we do the best job at building the most quickly, the things that are most important for our customers, then I'm really not worried about what the competitors will do. You've worked 10 feet away from Andy Jassy in the early days. Tell us something about the Amazon CEO that no one knows, but you. You're going to get me in trouble aren't you?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,744,2022-11-19 04:11:05
18131,"ей..... You worked 10 feet away from Andy Jassy in the early days. Tell us something about the Amazon CEO that no one knows but you. You're going to get me in trouble aren't you? We as you know I grew up in Seattle and Andy coming from New York has this fascination I don't understand with New York sports teams. So I've had to endure that for a lot of years. New Yorkers. So what are you going to do? Although he's I think come to adopt some of the Seattle teams, particularly the new hockey team, the Kraken here. As he should. As he should exactly. So how do you expect Andy will be different from Jeff or how has Andy already been different from Jeff? Well I think we're all different as leaders. I think it's all important that we it's important that we all bring our own stamp to it and operate within ourselves. I don't think I would be a very good Andy. I don't want to presume but I would assume that Andy wouldn't be a great Jeff because Jeff's Jeff Andy's Andy and I'm me. So I think that Andy was certainly bringing a great depth of experience from AWS which is one important part of the business and. So having operated that business for so long and I expect that will also give him an opportunity although he was involved in other parts of Amazon certainly for a number of years. We'll be able to bring a fresh perspective to the whole company just as I hope to bring to AWS and I think that fresh perspective is often helpful. I think just the mere act of change is useful for the business, for customers, for employees and just to shake things up a little bit. So I think just a fresh perspective. How will you be different from Andy? Well, I think that the world around us is changing so much that we're going to have to be different. It doesn't matter what we did yesterday and right after I joined we actually added two new leadership principles which is very exciting. One's around striving to be Earth's best employer and the second around focusing on the fact that success and scale bring broad responsibility. And those are things about which I personally am very passionate and so I really personally look forward to digging in and helping the company to figure out what are those things that we have to figure out. Where can we innovate to be Earth's best employer and then also to figure out externally what can we do to really be great citizens of our local communities, to be great citizens of our national communities and to be great citizens of the global community. And I care a lot about those things as a lot of other people do here but I plan to put a good amount of energy and time and focus and hopefully help Amazon innovate in all of those areas. How closely do you work with Andy Day-to-Day? Does he regularly weigh in on AWS decisions or not? Well, he's got a pretty broad scope of things to worry about now so he's got a pretty intense day job I believe. So he's really focused across the company as you would expect him to be but that being said, obviously AWS remains an important part of Amazon.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,745,2022-11-19 04:15:49
18132," pretty intense day job, I believe. So he's really focused across the company as you would expect him to be. But that being said, obviously, AWS remains an important part of Amazon. And so we touch base regularly, be it in person or via email, just on the most important things going on in the business. Does Jeff ever win on AWS decisions? Yes, I mean, really from the beginning, Jeff was involved at the very, very beginning at some of the most fundamental decisions. How do you price EC2? What do you name S3? What does the detail page look like? Obviously, over time, the business grew. But Jeff was always available when we needed him. And I certainly anticipate that'll be the same going for it. So is he still available now? And what do you understand that Jeff's priorities are? Sure. Well, let Jeff speak to his own priorities. But certainly, Jeff has been available when, for example, we've been doing our annual planning cycle as many companies have. And it's been great to have Jeff, you know, win on really where we're heading for the next year and beyond and to just make sure it's easy to get focused on the details of the business. And it's great to have multiple people who can help you pick your eyes up a little bit. Now, you joined AWS in the middle of a pandemic. You came back to AWS in the middle of a pandemic. That's hopefully moving into the rear view mirror. Moderna is one of AWS's biggest customers. If it weren't for the cloud, if it weren't for AWS, would we have had a vaccine as quickly as we did? I've got to tell you, I'm Iuse, but it's been an absolute privilege for us to work with Moderna because what they're doing, obviously, is literally life-saving. And they've been so innovative and so creative. So Moderna took a drug development process to get to the vaccine candidate. That process would typically have taken them 20 months. And doing that on AWS in conjunction with all the innovation on their side, reduced that 20 months to 42 days, 42 days to get the vaccine candidate, the mRNA vaccine candidate for COVID-19. And that was really running multiple parts of Moderna on AWS. So if you look at the drug design part, they had their drug design studio running on AWS, all the way to manufacturing with the new digitized manufacturing that they call their digital manufacturing platform. So it's really end to end. And the ability to use massive amounts of resources and to pick the exact type of service and capability for each part of the job and to really bring the full set of resources to bear. In addition to not having to focus on the IT and the infrastructure and the technology, and rather letting Moderna focus on the all-important job of drug discovery. So working in partnership, it was just magnificent to see what they accomplished. Since you joined AWS, a number of longtime AWS leaders have moved on to Microsoft, to Stripe, to Tableau. Does that concern you? Well, actually retention has been very good. If you mentioned the senior leaders, if you look at the VP plus ranks, the VP and above ranks at Amazon, the average tenure is over a decade, over 10 years. So that's actually very, very strong retention. So of course, you're always going to have some level of people coming and people going. And at the end of the day, that's actually healthy for the business. You want new perspectives to come in. Of course, in the right proportion. Amazon has opened an investigation after 550 employees supported a petition claiming a culture of discrimination, harassment, bullying, and bias. What's the status of this? Well, we are incredibly focused. And I personally believe it's incredibly important to really have a very diverse, inclusive and equitable environment. And we're going to make sure that whatever it takes, that we've got that. So we believe that we're really doing a lot of things to deliver on that. And we've got a lot of innovative efforts around bringing in a diverse workforce, which we have to have both because we're going to serve our customers best, they're diverse. We have to match that diversity. And also, I just believe that it's our responsibility. And it's the right thing to do. Anytime there is any possibility that you see the following.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,746,2022-11-19 04:19:51
18133," Our customers best their diverse, we have to match that diversity. And also I just believe it's our responsibility and it's the right thing to do. Yeah, anytime there is any possibility that things are not, something is not gone the way we wanted to. We're going to investigate it thoroughly. That's what we're in the middle of doing in this case and we'll make sure that we're operating in a way that's consistent with our values. And that's always the only goal. If you could rewind to the early 2000s, the earliest days of AWS. Is there anything you would have done differently to build an inclusive culture, to start with a more inclusive culture, to make sure that it didn't become a, you know, a boys club? Well, I don't think that's what we have. I think that we do have a really fun, exciting innovation led and inclusive culture. And that being said, these are hard problems. You know, we, I think we've done a lot, but we are nowhere close to where we need to be. We're going to be restless and dissatisfied with our progress on DE and I just as we are with every other part of our business. Mark Zuckerberg is making a big bet on the metaverse. How big do you think it's going to be? It's such an interesting sense. The metaverse is real. AWS has the biggest trove of sensitive corporate data in the world. I'm curious how you think about the balance between data and privacy and, you know, freedom and civil liberties in the modern era. I mean, there are governments. There are nation states around the world that want that information. Hackers and criminals want that information. Well, we are very clear to start with that. Our first job is security. We often say security is job zero. It was on the first page of our operating plan pretty much every year, every year that I can remember. But what about when governments request that information? So, subpoena that information? Sure. Well, we are very clear that our customers data is their data. So the data belongs to our customers. And not everybody operates that way. We are not going to look at customers data. We are not going to compete against our customers using their data. Their data is their data. And furthermore, we have all sorts of architectural best practices that our customers should be and are using for any sensitive data. And so a lot of that really relies around encryption. And so we've built a lot of different encryption capabilities so that any sensitive data, which could leak for any reason, be it to a government, be it to a hacker, be it to anyone else, any form of security breach, that it's encrypted and useless to anybody else. Given the broad array of encryption solutions that we provide, it's actually very doable and powerful for our customers to safeguard their data that way. Mark's up.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,747,2022-11-19 04:24:16
18134," encryption solutions that we provide, it's actually very doable and powerful for our customers to save throughout their day to that way. Mark Zuckerberg is making a big bet on the metaverse. Is AWS going to have a role in the metaverse? I think AWS already has a big role in the metaverse. So I think the cloud enables the metaverse. So if you think about all of the compute capacity, all of the storage, all of the machine learning which is required to create, you know, compelling and delightful end user experiences in the metaverse, a lot of that is already today running on AWS. So if you take Epic Games, for example, so Epic Runs Fortnite, you know, massively popular game, 350 million users worldwide and Epic Runs, almost everything on AWS from the backend, servers to the analytics and everything in between. So I think that's a great example of the metaverse at work and all that's happening today on AWS and we anticipate that's only going to grow really rapidly in the future. How big do you think it's going to be? Such an interesting sentence, the metaverse is real and yet it's virtual at the same time. I think that if we continue to do what we've always done, which is to provide a technology platform that allows organizations to transform, then these gaming and entertainment and social media and other companies will be able to do what they do best, which is to focus on innovating on behalf of their end users. And I think that the metaverse in many other areas will be rich with inventions. So this next conversation will happen in the spheres, in the metaverse. That's where we'll next meet. That could be on me, on me, on the metaverse. All right. See you there. Now, I know that climate change, you know, and stopping climate change and your data center footprint is a big passion of yours. How fast will Amazon's data centers get to carbon neutral? Amazon is already the largest purchaser of renewable energy in the world. And we intend to be 100% renewable energy by the year 2025. We originally said 2030. We actually accelerated that by five years to 2025. That's part of our broad climate pledge that Amazon created, and to which we've now gotten 200 other organizations to sign on to. And the climate pledge is to be a net zero carbon by 2040, 10 years ahead of the Paris Accord target. So we know how to do some of that. Other part are going to require invention, but we really look forward to it. And I think it's one of the most important things we can do for our generation. Amazon counts some of the biggest oil and gas producers as its customers. Isn't that a contradiction? Should you be kicking them off your platforms? Those customers are trying to get to sustainable business models which rely on new energy sources. And so many of those customers are figuring out how do they get to wind, how do they get to solar, how do they get into batteries, all new business models relying on renewable energy. And I think rather than abandoning them and having them maybe dig in more on fossil fuels, if we can enable them to move faster, to be more innovative, and to be more agile in figuring out new business models, new technical solutions, experimenting, failing fast, and moving on to the next idea, then the whole world will get to the renewable energy solutions that we need. At this year's re-invent conference, it'll be the first time that Andy Chassie is not giving the keynote. You will be, give us a preview. What can we expect to hear? We're going to have a lot of really exciting announcements. So I think across our service portfolio, you'll see that. We have a lot of exciting partner announcements. The partner ecosystem still remains to this day so important to what AWS is doing and we have some great announcements lined up for that. And then I think people are going to want to see that we're making it easier and easier for them to consume the cloud and to work with AWS. So we're going to continue to, in addition to building more powerful basic capabilities, we're going to continue to make it easier and easier in a variety of ways to interact with AWS.

Since this very first YouTube video was uploaded 16 years ago, the world's most popular video network has exploded to more than 2 billion users in the farthest corners of the planet, now raking in billions of dollars every year. It's evolved a long way from cat videos to become a one-click journey to the center of the zeitgeist, pop culture, and kig culture. Amplifying some of the brightest and sometimes darkest traits in all of us. While YouTube has elevated a generation of creators and educated and entertained generations of viewers, it's fought misinformation, terrorism, racism, and violence many clicks along the way. Currently, YouTube's biggest battles are focused on eliminating COVID and vaccine misinformation and keeping the platform safe for kids and teens. On this edition of Bloomberg Studio 1.0, we rewind to talk about where YouTube has been and fast forward to where it's going next, with one of the longest tenured employees and women at Google, the CEO of YouTube, Susan Wajitski. It's been five years since we last talked on camera and we have a new president. We are weathering a pandemic. The most watched video on YouTube is... Baby Shark? Baby Shark. So, a lot's changed since 2016. How do you feel about YouTube 2021 versus 2016? I feel good about it. It's definitely been a while and technology things moved so quickly, so a lot of things have changed since 2016. And overall, I've been really pleased that we've continued to grow and grow our ecosystem of creators. We've invested a lot in responsibility and that's been a really big focus for us. With weather through a pandemic and a lot of hard challenges, but overall, I'm feeling really good. You've been at Google for 20 plus years going all the way back to Larry and Sergey. In the garage, you've been the CEO of YouTube for seven plus years.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,749,2022-11-19 04:32:41
18136," Overall, I'm feeling really good. You've been at Google for 20 plus years going all the way back to Larry and Sergey in the garage. You've been the CEO of YouTube for seven plus years. How has your job changed in that time? Since I joined being the CEO of YouTube, I would say one of the biggest things that has changed certainly has just been maybe the recognition of the importance of digital video. So when I first joined, actually a lot of people would say, oh, like, why did you join? I was running ads beforehand and that was, that's been the main way Google generates revenue. And so a lot of people said, like, why did you leave that and go to YouTube? But I always believed in digital video. And I believe that now we see that the world also believes we've seen a lot of adoption of digital video and the benefits that that can have. You've championed this diversification strategy at YouTube since you started. What's working and what's not working? Well, our main way of generating revenue is from advertising. But we also have really grown our subscription revenue. And that has been really, really important from many different reasons. So that has enabled our users to have an experience where they can have music, YouTube music and premium. We just announced the 50 million subscribers that we were really excited about. But we also see other ways that our creators generate revenue. So our creators, for example, generate revenue with channel subscription. They may sell merchandise. We also have things like digital goods, so like super chat, super thanks. And so we've basically diversified the number of ways that our ecosystem is generating revenue. The original tagline for YouTube was broadcast yourself. And that concept has exploded. You have ordinary people in the spotlight. When they grow up, they want to be an influencer. They want to be a YouTube star or a YouTube creator. What do you see as the future of the creator economy? I see a lot of possibility with the creator economy. And because I see that many people have a lot of interest, and they have a lot to offer. And beforehand, they went up and able to have shared that with the world. And so there are so many people depending upon what their talent or their interest is, whether it's a sport or cooking or gaming or hairstyles that people have come out and really been able to share that and create a lot of jobs. So we actually see, we actually saw a 35% increase in the number of creators that are generating six figure income out of YouTube. And in the last year. And so that's just an example of how the creator economy is continuing to grow. Well, and for years, YouTube was the only company that actually paid creators. But now a lot of companies are paying creators. Facebook and Instagram, snap, TikTok. How do you see that competition playing out? Who wins? Well, it is a competitive landscape. And in general, competition's good. It makes everyone work harder and that's good. I mean, we look at creators and we say, they're going to come to us if we do the best job. And creators come to us looking basically for fame and fortune. Like, how can I, I have a skill or I have a talent. Something I want to share with the world like, and YouTube can help that be known. Can help them provide that fame. But also we can generate revenue for them. And so as long as we're doing a good job of that, creators are going to come to us. If we start to fail, then they're going to leave us and they're going to go to another platform. And so we just need to work really hard to make sure that we deliver that for our creators. A year ago during the Black Lives Matter protest, YouTube made big commitments to Black creators in particular. What's been the progress there? And how do you see YouTube, the potential for YouTube to be used as a tool for social justice? Well, so we've made an announcement that we were going to do a $100 million Black Voices fund. And so we're continuing to develop content there. But one of the other thing, and I think there'll be, there's been a lot of great content that's come out and we'll certainly see more. But because YouTube doesn't have any gatekeepers, like you can just post and become a creator, we have seen a lot of people of different backgrounds and underrepresented backgrounds, become creators and have audiences. We never really measured it beforehand because we didn't have a way. And so one of the things that we've done is within, with enabled creators to now.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,750,2022-11-19 04:37:06
18137," Become creators and have audiences. We never really measured it beforehand because we didn't have a way. And so one of the things that we've done is with enabled creators to now tell us what backgrounds they affiliate with so we can have a better understanding of how they're doing on our platform. Let's talk about YouTube shorts. It seems to be a top priority. We all know that TikTok is on the rise. How important are YouTube shorts to the platform, to the company? So YouTube shorts, it's very important. We see that creators and users want to watch all types of content, long form, short form. It turns out that the first video that was actually ever uploaded to YouTube, me and the zoo was in the 18 second video. So it was a short form video. And we have lots of short form videos and we've had it way before TikTok did. But what we have really been leaning into more is just enabling those to be found and then a lot of the creation tools. And so bringing a lot more mobile creation is really important for us going forward. Did you notice that viewing time was being lost to TikTok? Did you see that trend? And do you see TikTok as a sort of existential threat? I mean, we definitely see many competitors in this space. Well, we're just focused on our own metrics. Like, do we see our users engaging? Where's our opportunity? We're always looking around and seeing what our competitors are doing. And if they're doing something that we think would be good for our users and our creators, we're also going to look at how we can improve our own economy, creator economy, and what's good for our users. I think a lot of people, you know, we talk about vaccine hesitancy and they blame social media. They say YouTube's not doing enough. One of the big things for us is to continue to work with public health experts to get their messages across. Today's your big day. Are you excited? Mama is tired. They speed up work. You have to feed your creativity. So this tree house, you guys ready for the movie? See what we can do. At this point, YouTube has become a hub for discovery, for information, for, you know, it satisfies our curiosity, right? That comes with a lot of inspiration, but also with misinformation. When it comes to vaccines, vaccine hesitancy, videos that cause a public health risk, where do you want to see YouTube do better? We've taken responsibility very seriously. It's been one of my top priorities. So first of all, we want to make sure that if there's information that violates our policies, we came up with 10 different policies around COVID. Then if that's a violation of policies, then that's something that will remove. We removed over a million videos associated with COVID. But we also want to make sure that we're raising up information that we think would be, that come from trusted and authoritative sources. And we've really been able to do that. I think a lot of people, you know, we talk about vaccine hesitancy and they blame social media. They say YouTube's not doing enough, you know. How do you respond to that? Yeah, I mean, I think the areas around COVID are the closest to COVID that Church control unit is. So I didn't even measure our feet. I think the roads are so large, that they're considered an library shape. But, maybe maybe they'm cheaper than COVID. Yeah. So this data,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,751,2022-11-19 04:41:53
18138," not doing enough, you know, how do you respond to that? Yeah, I mean, I think, first of all, we're always learning. I just, just to be fair, like we're always thinking about how can we do better? We're looking at the feedback and working with public health experts across the board. And, you know, I think one of the big things for us is to continue to work with public health experts to understand, you know, what are the ways that we can partner with them to get their messages across. And I really believe that that is something that's really changed, is the evolution of bringing creators, musicians, experts talking about public health. We never would have seen that before in the pandemic. How much do you internalize the criticism of YouTube's content? Do you take it personally? And how does that influence the decisions that you make as CEO? I want to be doing the right thing. And I care about that. I care about the legacy that we leave. I care about the world that we leave to our children. I care about how media is consumed by the next generation and by everyone today. And so I really have put a lot of time and effort to make sure that we are acting responsibly. And there's always a balance between the free speech and the, right, but being responsible and taking down content that we think could lead to some kind of real-world harm. And so I mean, sure, I think whenever you're in a position like that, there's going to be a lot of criticism. But our goal is just to continue to talk to experts and evolve. And how do you make decisions in those tough moments where it's a tough call? Like how much of it is making a decision or leading by consensus and how much does it come down to you? The goal is that when we have tough decisions, they're not, we're not, they are like improvising in some way. Like we've made a concrete set of decisions beforehand and then we're looking and saying, is this something that meets our standards? Is it a violation or not a violation? And if it seems like there's some set of issues with the content that we have on the platform, we're going to go back to experts and then reevaluate. It should be making changes to our policies. YouTube helped keep a generation of children connected, educated, entertained, distracted through the pandemic. What have you learned from that experience? And what do you see as the potential future of YouTube as a tool for learning? As a tool in schools? When I meet people and they find out I'm the CEO of YouTube, almost always they tell me about something they learned on YouTube or someone that they're something their family member learn. So I see that as being a very significant part of YouTube. And during the pandemic, we certainly saw that a lot more education went online and we had all the homeschooling. We had people who had to also just learn a lot of skills that they hadn't learned beforehand. But probably the biggest thing that we also learned was just, and that I really saw was a need for us to continue to work with educational institutions. And the need for us to be able to integrate with some of the learning tools that the kids are all using because they are using YouTube. And there's a lot more that we can do to really help educators have YouTube be a key part of the curriculum. My kids are on YouTube a lot and sometimes more than I want them to be. And sometimes it's super productive and they're learning something cool. And sometimes it's not productive at all. How are you innovating to make the time that kids spend on YouTube more valuable? And of course, safe. It's very important to me as a parent to make sure that we're giving parents options about how what they want their kids to see. And that's one of the reasons that pretty much as soon as I got to YouTube, we started working on YouTube kids, which is a separate app, which is important for kids in terms of how we can control the quality. And we can give parents a lot more control about what kind of content is appropriate for them and their family. And there are many other things. Like we actually just came out with a supervised experience for tweens because tweens was one of the age groups that was actually hardest. They usually don't want to be on the kids app, but they're not 13 to be on the main app. And so the supervised experience is something that we recently came out with. The Wall Street Journal has been doing some in-depth reporting on Facebook. The report is that Facebook knew that Instagram was toxic for teen girls and didn't do anything about it. Does YouTube look at the impact it has on teen users? The influence it might have on someone's body image or self-esteem.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,752,2022-11-19 04:45:50
18139," and didn't do anything about it. Does you two look at the impact it has on team users, the influence it might have on someone's body image or self-esteem? First of all, I think it's a very important topic. And we do have a panel of experts that we work with to be able to help us understand what are the different ways that our product could be used or what are, how do we face some of these challenging issues to make sure that we're getting the best advice. And we certainly do see for a lot of really tough issues that YouTube can be a really valuable resource. So body positivity, mental health, we see a lot of creators actually talk about mental health and that for a lot of kids, it's really, it like destigmatizes and enables people to talk about what's happening and what's going on with them. The potential long-term impacts of YouTube on teams and on children, whether it is toxic or whether it's addictive, is that something that you wonder about, is that something that you struggle with, not just as a CEO, but as a mom? We certainly want to make sure that we are doing what we can to be responsible with kids and in every way possible. And that's one of the reasons that we actually have worked hard to give parents as many options as possible for them to decide what is important for them and their family, whether that's like limiting screen time, like limiting what is the content they actually have access to. I mean, even letting parents just say, these are like the 10 videos. My kid can only see these 10 videos. And so that is really important for us to give the tools back to parents for them to decide what is best for them and their family. Are you concerned about looming regulation? There may be regulation that is well-intended, but actually then has a really negative impact. Do you have another platform, I would like to begin by addressing the heinous attack on the United States Capitol. Like all Americans, I am outraged by the violence, lawlessness, and mayhem. How much did President Trump test YouTube and how much did it test you as a leader? And integrity is something that we see incredibly, is incredibly important, and we've leaned into in every way we possibly can. We treat all public figures and all public leaders the same as we treat any individual. And so, meaning that everybody is held to the same standards. And so we definitely held President Trump as we would hold all other presidents and all other elected officials to the same standards that we hold our creators and anyone else on YouTube. But was that difficult for you as the CEO of the company? I mean, that's kind of, that's like a big responsibility. I mean, yeah, it is difficult, but it is very...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,753,2022-11-19 04:50:29
18140," and anyone else on YouTube. What was that difficult for you as the CEO of the company? I mean, that's kind of, that's like a big responsibility. I mean, yeah, it is difficult, but it is very important and we also are global. So we're dealing with leaders from all over the world. And there were a number of leaders that, and there continue to be a number of leaders that post or that there's content that may be a violation of our policies. But we do hold a consistent standard across everything that we do. YouTube was the last platform to ban Trump. And you have said, his channel will be reinstated when an elevated risk of violence has subsided. How and when specifically will you make that decision? Well, we'll make that decision based on a number of different factors, whether that is like events in the news, signals were seeing from the government. And we'll certainly continue to evaluate that based on a large number of signals that we see. And will he ultimately be reinstated? I mean, we've stated that we will reinstate him when we believe that there is no risk to public safety or no public danger. Google just removed a voting app for the Russian opposition leader, Alexi Navalny. The Russian government seems to be stepping up requests to take down content. You've talked in the past about your family history, your grandparents living behind the iron curtain, being concerned about censorship back then. And Russia is a huge YouTube audience. How concerned are you about Russian government overreach? One of the things that is important to us at YouTube is the fact that we do enable so many voices and that we do enable people to express themselves and really celebrate the freedom of speech. And we certainly, that's a core value of ours. And but when we work with governments there are many things that we have to take in consideration. Like whether it's like local laws or what's happening on the ground. And so there's always going to be multiple considerations that we're going to have to take into consideration. Now, Vali said that YouTube deleted a video, one of his videos. Was that at the request of the Russian government? We certainly get requests from governments. And we look and consider what's, why are we getting the request? What's actually happening on the ground? And based on a whole bunch of different factors we make a decision. So we don't always, those are not always requests that make sense for us to honor, but in certain cases we will honor them in that country. The Biden administration seems to be targeting big tech. We've seen Mark Zuckerberg. We've seen Jack Dorsey now testify before Congress multiple times. And I've heard it said that YouTube is getting a pass. Do you think you should be up there testifying? Well, I think we do go a lot of scrutiny. I feel like there's a lot of scrutiny. And because YouTube is part of Google, Sundar has testified a number of different times and answered many different questions on YouTube. So I do believe there's a certain amount of scrutiny. And if I were ever asked to testify, it certainly would go and testify as well. You're one of the most senior women at Google. It's not the most senior woman at Google. Google has faced a lot of scrutiny for how it treats women in recent years. How much progress do you think Google has made in hiring and promoting women across the company? And how much progress do you think still needs to be made? I see a really big effort across technology as a whole to be able to be more inclusive. And I think that is really positive. I've been a big supporter of it. It's the very beginning. And I mean, I think at Google, there are many efforts. And there's a lot of work that has been done. And I'm sure there's a lot more for us to continue to do. And if you just look at the stats, you can see they're not enough women. We need more women in technology. And I think we have made a lot of progress, but it's still hard. It's harder to be a woman in technology. It's harder to be a minority of any kind. And so I think there's still a lot of work for us to do. When we last spoke five years ago, I asked you about being a mom. You have five kids. And you said something that really stuck with me. You said being a mom makes me a better leader. I prioritize better. I see something growing fast. And I run towards that. If something's growing closely, I'm like, I don't have time for that. How has that management strategy played out for you? I think it's played out really well.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,754,2022-11-19 04:54:32
18141," Growing fast and I run towards that is something's growing closely. I'm like I don't have time for that. How has that management strategy played out for you? I think it's played out really well. Thank you, Sven. I mean, rare decision is everything when you look at it because we have a lot of opportunity. There's a lot of moving pieces, very dynamic environment. So if you can prioritize and say these are like the most important things to do, then you know, you're going to get there faster. Learn, start, they have no left. How long do you plan to keep running YouTube? How long do you plan to stay at Google? As long as I have a mission that I believe in and that I think that I'm excited about getting done. So I have a lot of ways that I see that YouTube can continue to grow. I have a lot of products and ideas and things that aren't yet released and things that we don't aren't yet doing. And I'm excited about getting those done. So I think if there comes a time where I no longer have a list of projects, or I feel like I don't have that much more to add, then it'll be probably time to do something else. Would you throw your hat into the ring to be Alphabet's next CEO or if the board asked you, would you step up and do that? Well, I think Sender is doing a great job. Very, very, please. I think he's doing, I mean, it's a very challenging job. There's a lot of different constituents and a lot of product, a lot of different issues. And I mean, I'll just say I'll always do whatever would be wherever I could be most helpful to the company. Do you still talk much to Larry and Sergey? I do still see them socially, though, not work wise. Do you ever talk about work? I mean, sometimes we'd be casually, but our business is very complex right now. And there's a lot of things that are happening. And so it's hard for, I mean, people may have different opinions, but to really engage at the long conversation. What do you want your legacy to be? I am proud of the way that we've been able to enable people to have a channel, to have an audience. I just met with a number of three creators. And YouTube really was able to let them shine and create audiences in a business that employ people that otherwise never would have happened. And so that's certainly one continuing to grow that. I'd say a second, it's been really important to me to see a lot more women in technology. That has been just a personal goal of mine is to be a role model and try to support women. And I feel very fortunate to have gotten to where I have. And I know it was due to like many different factors. And I want to support the next generation of women and make see technology as like an open place where anyone can come and be successful. And then probably lastly continue to grow what we're doing with education. Susan, would you please have YouTube? Thank you so much for having me. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,755,2022-11-19 04:58:42
18142," // Hello! Good! How are you? It's so great to see you. Thank you so much for doing this. What do you think about all this love's getting into? I think that that I think was more last year. I think it's kind of a way of that past. No, I don't think so, but I think it's like any time that frankly it's when a lot of other people get into crypto, right? Other audiences too. It's when it's in the news a lot. When does that happen? A lot of times when the prices are going up. She was a federal prosecutor going after gangs and the mob before being handed for next assignment, taking down Bitcoin. Katie Han soon realized this new technology was much more than a tool used by criminals. She dove deep and became a crypto convert, swapping her prosecutor hat for a board seat at Coinbase, became the first female general partner at Venture Firm and Recent Horowitz. Han, now a prolific crypto investor, recently launched her own fund with one and a half billion dollars to deploy. It's the largest fund ever raised by a single investor. Joining me on this edition of Bloomberg Studio 1.0, CEO and founder of Han Ventures, Katie Han. Katie, it's so great to have you. Great to be back here in the studio with you, Emily. I want to start with a vibe check. Okay. This state of the crypto cycle, are we in?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,756,2022-11-19 05:03:35
18143," Katie, it's so great to have you. Great to be back here in the studio with you, Emily. I want to start with a vibe check. Okay. What state of the crypto cycle are we in right now? It was hot. Yeah. And then it got pretty cold. Hmm. Well, look, Emily, zooming back, because I've been in crypto for a decade, if you can believe it. We've seen crypto be really hot, and then all of a sudden not. And so we've seen this before. However, I think one of the things that's a little bit different now is with each new crypto cycle, more and more people come into it. And so it's more and more pronounced each cycle. And I would push back on its knot. I think it depends on what area of the ecosystem you're looking at. We think developers think crypto and Web3 is still really hot. I am seeing a lot less of those, we're all gonna make it hashtags. I am seeing a lot less of them too, although I am spending less time on Twitter, so maybe that's why. Well, but with each cycle, there are new acronyms. What hasn't happened is a crypto winter in the midst of really serious global macro conditions. So we have inflation, kind of at record highs for our generation, in our lifetime. And then we have also a war that's broken out in the Ukraine, and we have a number of other factors going on here. So that's very different. There was some serious carnage out there. Socius, Luna, three-houros. What's been your takeaways from that? I don't want to sit here and tell you that algorithmic stablecoins are bad because I actually think they're really interesting. However, I think what happened is you had, in this case you mentioned Luna and Tara, that was an algorithmic stablecoin that was getting pretty widespread adoption relative to what the tech could do. I didn't realize you spent your teenage years living in Egypt and learning Arabic. Tell me about your upbringing. I was always uprooted. My dad worked for a large company and we were always moving just when I would get comfortable in one space. And I think actually that's pretty important. If you fast-forward and look at my career, I'm comfortable being in uncomfortable situations. I didn't know a lot about venture when I got into it initially. I didn't know a lot about crypto when I got into it initially. And I was okay asking questions. I was okay not knowing the local acronyms or the Nomenclature of a particular field. And I'm taken right back to my teenage years in Cairo moving from Houston, Texas one day to downtown Maddie in Cairo the next day. You studied law. I did. You clerked for Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy. That's right. You became a federal prosecutor. You were taking on prison gangs and the mafia. That must have taken a really thick skin. I was doing it at each 25. And now if I take a step back and you know, I think that happens at different points in your career. Like, whoa, if I would have analyzed that a little more at the time and I'm kind of in some ways glad I didn't. I just dove right in because I found it fascinating. There was a human aspect to it and people's stories. And I felt like those stories mattered. So I was drawn to criminal law and became a federal prosecutor. And I did cases involving violent crime but then really mistriing cases. Being back in the courtroom, being before the grand jury. Like the prosecutor you would see on TV going to try those murder cases. Doing those two hour closing arguments. That's right. And so moved out here to California. I died at the largest prison gang in the world at the time. Outlaw motorcycle gangs, hostage taking, bank robberies, armed bank robberies. There was really not a kind of criminal case by that point in my career. I hadn't done it. It was right around that time, 2012. One of my bosses came in and said, let's have that same energy that you brought to those gang cases, to those murder cases. And let's go ahead and have you investigate this new criminal technology that we really need to look into and possibly shut this down. So you created the first cryptocurrency task force. How would you describe it? Fortunately, several of us in the government realized at the time it's not possible, also not desirable. Because Bitcoin is not an entity. It's not a person. It's a protocol. And it would be like saying, let's go shut down cash. Let's go shut down the internet. It's not possible. Probably wouldn't be a good idea, either. I was using crypto and technologies like the Bitcoin blockchain, because that's all it existed. Then this is 2012, 2013 to actually uncover crimin activity. and entity.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,757,2022-11-19 05:07:48
18144," Using crypto and technologies like the Bitcoin blockchain, because that's all that existed then, this is 2012, 2013, to actually uncover criminality. So I didn't think that that technology was bad. Frankly, it was a tool that helped me uncover the various activity. And by the way, it was a step-level function improvement better than compliance by banks. I'll just go ahead and say it. That's a little bit controversial, but I had spent a decade subpoenaing large financial institutions, and five times out of 10 didn't get back what I needed. One case I worked on, and people always say, oh, you shut down the Silk Road. What actually happened? I was looking into something completely, not having to do with anything at all of the Silk Road, and came across some, what looked to be some kind of odd activity. And it turns out that a couple of federal agents on the Silk Road Task Force out of Washington, DC were cropped. And that is the case that I ended up in dining, and I ended up prosecuting those agents, and they both went to prison. So that's the aspect of what Silk Road case that I worked on. I would never, never have been able to uncover that criminal activity by those agents, because they were federal agents, they knew how to cover their tracks, had they not use Bitcoin blockchain. So that technology right there, if they had just used wires or cash or bank wires, we would never have uncovered that. MUSIC Just how hard is it to launch a crypto fund from scratch? MUSIC You've got to explain this one to me. What does it mean when the White House says we're watching markets carefully? It means they have a Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. They have been and seen it. Lots of Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. What does it mean? What does it mean? What does it mean? It means they have a Bloomberg. So what's the best investment advice you've ever been given by anybody? The compound interest, the compounding of returns is an incredible miracle of business, finance, and human existence. Everything you learn is additive every day. And if you keep at it and don't quit, it's an incredible miracle. And it's not just interest. It was always said about compound interest returns. Compound business returns. Compound human returns. They're all very additive because you learn every day. And if you keep at it, it's very, very, very helpful. In your observation of investors, what do you think is the biggest mistake that average investors make? Selling at the wrong time. And they sell when the prices go down? Yes. Or yes. Not keeping. Look, people have conviction or they invest for the, if they invest for the right reasons, just keep at it. So you became kind of a crypto convert after this. You joined the board of Coinbase. That's very early on. How did you and Coinbase and Brian Armstrong come together? I hosted an event here in San Francisco at the Federal Reserve Bank. And I believe it was there that it wasn't just Brian. It was a lot of what I'll call legitimate actors and crypto who wanted to usher in this new wave, this new ecosystem. And then we brought together the heads of all kinds of agencies, really in an effort to kind of talk about building bridges. The government and the crypto industry, we're never going to see eye to eye on a lot of things, but we did think there were some commonalities. Coinbase is a company that has suffered. They've been losing share. The valuation of the public markets has plummeted. Why do you think that is? And how do you think it can be fixed? Yeah. Well, I think again, a few things it's tied to. One, a large aspect of Coinbase's business now, of course, is trading revenue. And that's down when prices are down. And the company's been very transparent about that long before going public. I mean, also, if you look at its S1, it specifically identifies that. And just how volatile crypto cycles are. So I think that's part of it. It's judged by public markets as a technology stock, or as a financial services company. By the way, I think it's both. I think it's not just.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,758,2022-11-19 05:11:49
18145," So I think that's part of it. It's judged by public markets as a technology stock or as a financial services company. By the way, I think it's both. I think it's not just a financial services company. I think it's so much more. I think it's really a portal to this whole new ecosystem. You were also on the board of OpenC until recently there's an insider trading situation or accusation going on there. Coinbase has also had employees accused of insider trading. How much is this happening within crypto companies and within the industry and how big a problem is? Yeah, I think crypto is under the microscope. So where you have a case, two cases, three cases in crypto ecosystem, which now is a trillion dollar industry. I think multi-billion approaching trillion dollar industry, you're always going to be able to find examples like that. So I don't want to make too much out of a handful of cases. That said, the company, Coinbase, OpenC, take these things incredibly seriously. Along with your position at Coinbase, you became a partner at one of the most story venture capital firms in Silicon Valley and that is Andrews and Horowitz. What was your experience at A16Z-like? There I met Chris Dixon and I met Ben Horowitz and I met Mark Andrews and I had worked with them for just about a year, maybe a little bit over when they asked me to come and co-run their crypto funds at Andrews and Horowitz. Again, I jumped at that chance and I think really that speaks to the fact that as I said before, things are a hell yes for me. So Andrews and Horowitz is the kind of place where if you make a partner, you don't leave. Yeah. How did Mark and Ben respond when you said, yeah, I want to leave to start a crypto fund of my own. As you might know, Emily, they're an anchor. They're an anchor check into my fund and I'm very grateful for that. You know, Mark and Chris and folks like them are also personal LPs. So I felt very supported when I shared that decision. And I will say that it was not running away from Andrews and Horowitz. It was running to another opportunity. And you know, crypto is not, what do they say? It's not a spectator sport. It's like, you're in it. It's very young. It's 24-7. It's global. And it's hustle. And at this, and that's a trade-off. It's a life trade-off. And at this point in my career and in my life, if I was going to continue to make that trade-off, I just wanted to do it and do it in a way that was really true to me. So you struck out on your own? Yes. To launch on Ventures, what gave you the courage to do that? What was the spark that lit the fire? Yeah. That got you to say, I need to do this and do this now. Sure. What I set out to do was to continue to invest in this ecosystem that I think is so broad that decision was very purposeful and the timing was very purposeful. We have an early stage fund that does seed stage, Series A, even Series B. And then we have what we call an acceleration fund, which is, it's not a growth fund. It's a crypto-growth fund. And I think those are different things. But it's later stage. It might be crypto-publics. Certain kinds of public tokens were set up to hold tokens and participate in the token ecosystem. Or later stage companies. I mean, you know, there are now several crypto, many crypto unicorns. The space has become really competitive. Even though you say, you know, crypto's had its kind of ups and downs. The thing is, a lot of people in some of those last cycles have seen the kind of venture style returns that can be had in crypto. And so you've had a lot of new funds enter the space. And that's driven up competition. So what differentiates on ventures then? From, you know, all of these other crypto funds or even the more traditional venture capitalists, like entries in Harowitz or Sequoia, they also have crypto funds now. Well, I think a lot of traditional venture capital funds now have crypto funds. It used to just be like a regulatory designation. It was like, are you an RIA, which is registered investment advisor? I would say for crypto founders today, it's not enough to just be an RIA, right? They, frankly, I don't even know if a lot of them care. That's a regulatory designation. What crypto founders today want to know is, do you live in Brith crypto? Do you inhale the discourse? Are you part of the community? Do you participate in governance? Are you going to be staking these kind of crypto verbs out there? And if you're not really in this space full time, I think it's very hard to run a successful crypto fund. We don't have a hedge fund component. So we're not sitting here buying and trading and selling. That's a hedge fund structure. And there are crypto hedge funds. We're not one. We're not one.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,759,2022-11-19 05:16:12
18146," We don't have a hedge fund component. So we're not sitting here buying and trading and selling. That's a hedge fund structure and there are crypto hedge funds. We're not one. We're making seven to ten-year bets. Just how hard is it to launch a crypto fund from scratch? You know it's hard but it's not impossible. We don't have a crystal ball. I don't know. I can't predict cycles but I knew that we were in a cycle where you saw so much for an excitement around the space. And I already talked about what makes this different. But I think one thing also is we are a nimble strike force. We don't fish in the same pond. We have the crypto natives. We have a fishing execution. We have operators, seasoned operators who really know how to stick the landing. And I think that's reflected on our culture. I would say the only thing that's changed in our strategy as a result of the market correction is really more of a focus on early stage. But we still have our late stage fund. And when we see valuations, which I think will still see correct, spoiler. I think we'll continue to see some corrections. And so we might deploy our later stage fund a little bit more slowly. It might not be on an even 50-50 cadence. And that's okay. Long-term, our strategy hasn't changed. Long-term, we're committed to this space. How much do you think valuations are going to correct? You know, it's just, I can't give you a one-size-fits-all answer because crypto is not a monolith. You have some crypto companies that really follow more of an enterprise SaaS business model. You have others that are layer one protocols. You have still others that are consumer-facing applications. And I think one of the things we're seeing right now is the infrastructure layer. And that's where we're spending a lot of our time, by the way. And we think more and more use cases will come about when the infrastructure layers in place. So my own view is we are not rushing to deploy. We're certainly not getting caught up. You do get VC FOMO. I try not to. I try not to. You know, look, I think it's very easy to get into that mindset. Right? It's because it's a competitive sport. It's a competitive space. And I think I'd be lying if I said that that doesn't influence anyone. I try to, what I do, and I think I do differently, is I try to take stock of that. Oh, that's the FOMO mentality kicking in. That's bad. Again, you don't want to over-correct, though. What we look for is we look for amazing founders. It doesn't matter if I think valuations will correct if they're amazing founders. There's a huge tam. We also look for what's your regulatory plan? If you're launching a token, what's your plan to comply with the law? What's your plan for security, by the way? We've seen a lot of hacks in the space. We want to really dive in there and make sure that the founders have been thoughtful about, especially if they're custodian customer funds, keeping those funds secure. If it's a cross-chain bridge, what are the exploits? Have you changed your strategy at all, given the downturn? What? Have you backed out of any deals or decided not to do certain deals? Because the conditions have changed since you raised the phone. We have decided not to do certain deals. We've never backed out of a deal. We have decided not to do a few deals because we think that pricing was ahead of progress candidly. And we might have been wrong about that, Emily. We might have been wrong about that. But I think if we were wrong not to do a couple of deals, better that we might have been right. Because if we were wrong about that, I think we can find a way to still invest in those projects later. Well, one thing I'm hearing is that a lot of dry powder has just sucked up. Yeah. Because all these funds raised a lot of money and raised the biggest fund ever for a single person, not just a woman. Anyone? Are you confident you're going to have a place to put all that money? I am, but if I don't have a place to put it, I'm not just going to go willing, nearly deploy it. One of the things that we told our LPs even during the period when we raised our fund, which was when crypto was undeniably still on a bull run, we said that we are going to be pretty steadfast, sticking to a tier deployment cycle. And I think one thing that's changed is that might have lengthened. It certainly hasn't shortened. But we will, again, we feel very good that we have the capital to back great teams when we see them. So you think we're going to fall behind the United States? I think we already are falling behind. Fall behind. I think we're falling behind.

Welcome to the world of decentralized finance. Bloomberg's covering all things crypto. The people, the transactions and the technology. Bloomberg crypto Tuesdays. Bloomberg surveillance. Be informed. Be prepared. Be ahead of the game. What about NFTs? And are you concerned about the declining demand? We are going to increasingly live in a digital world. And I happen to think that if you live in a digital world, you're going to want to own digital goods in that world. You're not just going to be satisfied to rent them, which is what we do now. We buy our content from walled gardens without digital scarcity, which is what NFTs unlock. You don't really own anything. You're subject to the whims of a platform. And I think NFTs and digitally scarce goods fundamentally change that. I think you'll see NFTs back again. But we are spending a lot of time in the infrastructure layer. Like I tell you, zero knowledge, technology, scalability. We think of that as like the plumbing. If you think of the fiber-hubbetic cables. Remember, you couldn't have had YouTube and Netflix with dial-up. You couldn't have streamed content. The same is true of crypto use cases. We think that there will be a lot of new use cases unlocked when the infrastructure is there, when it's more efficient, when it's more user friendly. And so we're spending a lot of our time there. President Biden issues this crypto executive order. There are a number of ports that are coming due. What do you want to see from the administration when it comes to regulation? Are you optimistic that we will get there? Yeah, we were so delighted to see that executive order. It's not something you should normally be delighted about. But why we were is because it was to us a real recognition that this is a US government saying this field isn't going anywhere. This field is growing. It's growing so much that we are going to direct every single agency in the federal government to come up with a plan here. I think we take a step forward, but then you see we're a big government. We're a big system. We have states. We have local entities. So we take a step forward with the EO. And then we take some steps back sometimes too. And I think what I see as crypto founders are confused by that. They're starting to think, well, I could go to this jurisdiction where there's a single regulator. And you don't have 50 states with different rules. It's the US government that needs to start taking stock of the fact that right now, Emily in China, there's a quarter of a billion ECNY wallets, a quarter of a billion. We're still talking about whether there should be a government central bank digital currency. We're still studying that. So you think we're going to fall behind the United States? I think we already are falling behind. Fall behind China. And we're falling behind. What are the dangers of falling behind China and the rest of the world? This is years ahead. So I don't want people to take a headline and say, oh, I think the US dollar will be no longer the global currency, reserve global currency. I'm not saying that now. But fast forward decades. And if you no longer need to use the dollar because you have an alternative, I think that's a real problem. What would we use instead? Well, I think that there are going to be stable coins out there that people who have access to a smartphone will use. There is a demand for it. We see a 285 percent year of your growth with stable coins. So people are clearly liking the idea of this. Now, again, there have been some spectacular failures too, but not all stable coins are created the same. But I think the important thing is that we really do need to not just quash innovation. What do you think of how Gary Gensler, the chair of the SEC, and how he's approaching it? One of the things that I hear from founders is that they're very confused because they get told, come in, register, just come in and talk to us. You have the one.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,761,2022-11-19 05:24:46
18148," the SEC and how he's approaching it. One of the things that I hear from founders is that they're very confused because they get told, come in, register. Just come in and talk to us. But you have the one company who's done the ultimate act of going in and registering coinbase, filed an S1. And still, you know, there's a lot of saber rattling still going on, I think. And again, I don't want to single out the SEC. And I don't want to suggest that anything they're doing is bad, I do think though that right now there's a lot of confusion. And one of the pieces of confusion stems from the fact that, you know, and it started with the ICO mania back in what 2016, 2017. I can't remember which year now, where the SEC was very loud about securities. A lot of them were securities, but the space has changed. And so to still view it through the ICO lens when so much has happened over the last five years in the space, I think is a mistake. What do you have to say to the skeptics out there who just don't believe in the future of Wem 3? And don't see where this is going. Yeah. I would say don't judge the current state of innovation by the end state of innovation. I hear from a lot of these skeptics. And by the way, I'm friends with a lot of these skeptics too. I don't only want to live in a crypto bubble. They want to see the use cases, especially if they're not technical. Well, when am I going to use it? What will I use it for? And I think one of the things that's not appreciated is how quickly the infrastructure here is catching up. And once you have really scalable blockchains that can handle a lot of thorough put and are very efficient, I think that unlocks a whole lot of use cases. People are spending more time on screens. That curve is up and to the right. Whether we like it or not, that is the future. I mean, those who have kids know that kids spend more time online. They want digital things too. And I think to dismiss it, it is a bit generational. I do find not always, but it is a bit generational. If you talk to kids about being able to have money online, they instantly get that concept. They're comfortable not having to hold something in their hand to think it has value. Take us to the end state. Do Google and Amazon and Facebook and Apple still exist? I believe they will still exist. I mean, it depends what you talk about when you talk about the end state. I mean, I think that, you know, I think for decades, those companies will still be around. But the important thing is I think this new ecosystem is going to represent a challenge to them. I do think that those entities, decentralized forces, are coming. And we'll cut into those entities, profits, and revenues. So we have a little rapid fire section. If you could belong to any altcoin tribe, the Twitter B. Gosh. There is no way I'm answering that, because I will get trolled on Twitter by every other altcoin tribe. I'm a crypto maximalist. I'm a crypto maximalist. All right. Well, I'm not picking one.

And I just found out we actually lived in the same dorm in college just a few years apart. So it's been almost a year since you took over from Jeff as CEO of Amazon. And it's been a year of first, the first Docs Blitz since the.com boom. The first vote to unionize an Amazon warehouse, your first Bloomberg technology conference. Thank you. I want to start with a quick report card. Music In February 2021, Jeff Bezos shocked the world by announcing plans to step down as Amazon CEO. A few months later, he passed the reins to Andy Jassy, his longtime top lieutenant, the architect of one of the company's biggest profit engines, Amazon Web Services. Bezos has stayed on as executive chair, leaving Jassy to navigate a critical inflection point in Amazon's history. How does the company manage market turmoil, rising inflation and regulatory scrutiny, and a push by some warehouse workers to unionize all while keeping customers coming back? Joining me on this edition of Bloomberg Studio 1.0, Amazon's second CEO, Andy Jassy, he joined us from our flagship Bloomberg Technology Summit in San Francisco. I'd like you to grade your view of Amazon's performance. And we've got time later to really dig in. But quickly, how would you grade Amazon's performance over the last year with customers? Well, I think we've, you know, I'm not sure I'm the right person to grade myself during the year or not. But I'll give you my take. I think with respect to customers, I think we've done a lot of good. And I think if you look at it during the pandemic, which really has extended till the early part of this year, you know, so much as a PPE and food and essential.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,763,2022-11-19 05:33:24
18150," I think if you look at during the pandemic, which really has extended till the early part of this year, you know, so much as the PPE and food and essential items and people equipping their home offices were bought from Amazon and, you know, to scale the way we needed to. Remember, in 2020, we grew 39 percent year over year on a $245 billion revenue run rate. I mean, it's unprecedented. It's never happened before. But it was really hard to do that. And we had to take the really big footprint of the fulfillment center footprint. We built the first 25 years of Amazon and doubled it in 24 months. We built out that transportation network in just a couple of years. You know, we nearly doubled the size of our workforce during that time. And I think you saw it in other businesses. You know, AWS is a really big part of helping companies and governments have business continuity during the pandemic. And so many companies and organizations in the last year made the strategic decision that they were going to stop running their own infrastructure technology and disproportionately chose AWS to help them move to the cloud. And we've spent a lot of time helping them make that transformation. So what about investors? I mean, the stock is down significantly from a peak last year. Obviously, there's broader market turmoil. Yeah, I think, you know, for investors financially, I'd say it's mixed. You know, I think we have some businesses that are growing really strongly. If you look at AWS in 2021, grew 37% year-over-year. It's not a $74 billion revenue run rate business. It's pretty unusual growth. And we grew 58% year-over-year in our advertising business. You know, what's the $32 billion revenue run rate business? So some businesses are growing really strongly. And we've continued to grow in our retail business despite pretty crazy comparables during 2020. But I think the real challenge for us there is on the cost side. And there have been several things that have happened. Some of which are more controllable than others. You know, I think the part that's less controllable is really around inflation. And I think we thought that inflation would start to attenuate in 2022. And with the war in Ukraine, it just went the other way and has significantly accelerated. And so the cost of trucking and line haul and ocean and air and fuel has just substantially gone up. And I think that will attenuate at some point. No one knows how long that'll take. I think the more controllable areas for us are really around fulfillment center capacity and productivity. It was taking about 24 months to build new fulfillment centers during the pandemic. And so we had to make decisions, you know, in mid-2020 and early 2021, on how much demand we were going to plant for it. And so, you know, we end up with more capacity than we need right now. And there's a number of things that we're working on. We've stopped building on properties where we don't need it yet. And we've let a number of leases lapse and not a small number, you know, of both those things. We've had a lot of occasions in our history where we've worked on productivity and made improvements. And we have a lot of clearly defined issues. And I'm confident we're going to get back to the right level of profitability. You are going to sub-lease 30 million square feet of space. Is there a mistake in the execution there because of the overbuilding? Again, because you have to make these decisions two years in advance. And again, if you put yourself back in 2020 where we were growing 39% year-over-year on a $245 billion revenue run rate, it's very hard to know what's the right amount to build. And you have to make a decision. And we made the decision to err on the side of our consumers and sellers. Now, how would you grade Amazon's performance with employees, your colleagues? There has been some high profile. Yeah. I think that when I started in this gig, we had just created a new leadership principle to strive to be Earth's best employer. And I think we're, you know, we've spent a lot of time trying to think through what that really means. It's broad. And I think we've made a fair bit of progress, but it's still early, in my opinion. But I still think there are many areas that we can keep improving. You know, and I think, you know, the first one I'd mention is safety. You know, I think that, you know, in our fulfillment centers, that is the top priority. And, you know, when you get into the details and numbers and outside of all the spin of it all, you know, we're about average there, but we're not trying to be average. You know, we want to be the best in the industry and the best in the world at it. And that's a high priority and an area that I'm passionate about and the team is passionate about. And I think we have a lot of work we can do to make our employees everyday lives easier. We have, we've done...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,764,2022-11-19 05:37:53
18151," priority and an area that I'm passionate about and the team is passionate about. And I think we have a lot of work we can do to make our employees everyday lives easier. We've identified kind of a top 100 list of areas that we can be better at, that we are just metronomically stepping through. And so we've made a lot of progress, but we've a lot of work to do still. Elam must just came out saying he has a super bad feeling about the economy, Tesla laying off 10% of his staff. Jamie Dimon says he's preparing for an economic hurricane. The World Bank just slashed its forecast for global growth. How do you feel about the economic climate? Well, I wasn't planning on giving any guidance to the camera. Please. But, super bad or super bad. I think there are some things that are related to Amazon that are useful to remember. I think the first piece is, remember that 85% of the worldwide retail market segment share is offline. And if you believe that that equation is going to flip at some point, which we do, I think it will flip over a long period of time. If you look at different downturns, should we have one at some point? We've been through a few, obviously, in the 25 years that I've been at Amazon, customers change their habits. And so I also think there's, those two reasons, those two factors give me some optimism that even if we have a downturn, that we have the potential to still grow. We have a roadmap that's probably three to five years long, and we're going to continue to invent, we're going to continue to be insurgent, and we have a lot of work to do to get to where we think we ultimately can get for customers. Now when it comes to the stock, as I mentioned, it has fallen significantly. Do you think investors are missing something or has tech just been overvalued? And this also, of course, matters to employees who are significantly paid in stock? Well, you know, I look, I haven't been at Amazon for 25 years. I arrived at the company three weeks before we went public. I have never tried to predict what the stock is going to do. And anytime I've tried to a little bit, I've been wrong. So, you know, I think it's a pretty hard to predict what's going to be in any short period of time. I do really believe that Benjamin Graham maximum that in the short term, the stock market tends to be a voting machine, and the long term it tends to be a voting machine. And I think if you, you know, we've been through a lot of points in 25 years at Amazon, where the macro factors are off and stocks are down, our stock is down. But you can't really control that. You know, we have a concept we talk about a lot of Amazon inputs and outputs. You know, and the ultimate output for a company is share price. You know, and then other big outputs are free cash flow or profit or revenue. You can't really manage the outputs. You have to manage at the input level. And that's where we spend all our time. And so, if you do the right things for the business long term, things tend to work out. I think we've had very good returns for investors, and I expect that to be true again. Do you see Amazon strategy as fundamentally different from Netflix and Disney, and if so, how? The top names in climate change are on Bloomberg. I want everybody committed to the kind of action that we need. We have a global emergency now. You know, we're still putting 162 million tons of man-made global warming pollution into the sky every day using the sky as an open sewer. It's strapping as much extra heat as would be released by 600,000 erosion of class at Tommy Klum exploding every day. That's what the scientists tell us and the data shows it. That's crazy. That's why we have a third of Pakistan underwater. That's why we have the historic heat wave.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,765,2022-11-19 05:42:15
18152," Why we have a third of Pakistan underwater, that's why we have the historic heat wave in China. Nothing comparable to that ever. That's why the heat records are broken every year. And we're seeing in an increase in the flows of climate refugees crossing international borders that are due to vastly expand unless we take action to solve the climate crisis. Nobody covers climate change like Bloomberg, your global business authority. What are the moon shots at Amazon that are capturing most of your time and attention? What is going to define the next era of Amazon? Is it Astro, the home road, butters? Is it something else? Well, we have a unique way that we look at big new investments. And I'm not sure it's right or wrong, it just happens to be our way. And we ask ourselves when we're considering something for questions. We ask if it's successful, can it be big and move the needle in Amazon? Is it being well served today? Do we have a differentiated approach? And do we have confidence there, and if not, can we acquire quickly? And if we like the answer to those questions, we'll go pursue it with a single threaded team that isn't distracted by the rest of the business. And sometimes that leads to innovation investments that seem pretty obvious. When I got to that company, it was a book's only retailer, and then we expanded to music and video and electronics and toys. It seemed obvious to people. Other times that process does not lead to investments that seem obvious to people. AWS was something that people externally and internally thought was a little bit nutty at the time. But just imagine what Amazon would be today without AWS. And I think that you see the same thing here. There are so many significant investments from making that I'm excited about. I'm going to have to constrain myself to a few. But I'm really excited about what we're doing in the prime video space. I think we're clearly on the right track there and building a significant business. That's interesting because Netflix also just announced some layoffs. First subscriber loss in a decade, Disney cutting back on costs. Do you see Amazon strategy as fundamentally different from Netflix and Disney and if so, how? We're very bullish on it. And remember, all the models are a little bit different. But for prime video, we have 200 million plus prime subscribers who get that entertainment for free by being part of prime. And so we have a little bit different pricing model than some of the others. But I'm incredibly encouraged by what we have coming. If you look, I mean, we launched this show. Reacher earlier in the year was a huge hit. We, you know, we had the New Maisel season. We just launched the new Boys season, which is how you made Boys fan. I am a big boy. Because Amazon bought. It's very good. Of course, we have one of the rings coming up in September and Thursday at football. So I'm very bullish about it. We also here, we're excited about what we've done with MGM. I think some of the assets there will go very well with the rest of what we're doing entertainment-wise. And so if you look at Warner Brothers Discovery and Paramount and Stars and Global, they're building really significant subscription businesses. So I'm very bullish about that business. I'm optimistic that we have a chance to build a significant grocery business, which is, you know, early stages for us. I'm excited about Kuiper, which is our low-earth orbit satellite that we're building. You gotta remember, there are 300 to 400 million people in the world who have limited to no internet connectivity. I mean, just think about how different the world is when you don't have that type of connectivity. And so I think that's a really significant opportunity that has some AWS characteristics to it. I continue to be very optimistic about Alexa, you know, building the world's best personal assistant. We have, you know, 200 million endpoints already that are using Alexa. We're clearly onto something there. And then you are autonomous driving, ride-hailing service and zoos that we're building, you know, here in Bay Area. I just think with the way auto consumption is evolving, I think that also is a chance to be really significant business. Now I don't know if, I don't know, if all of them are going to be successful, but if any one of them becomes the fourth pillar for us on top of marketplace and prime and AWS, we're a completely different company. Just like we were when AWS became successful. So I think they're very worthwhile investments and bets and I'm optimistic about them. We didn't mention Astro.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,766,2022-11-19 05:46:37
18153," So I think they're very worthwhile investments and bets and I'm optimistic about them. We didn't mention Astro, obviously, though, powered by Al-Exa. You mentioned Astro, yeah. But I mean, our home robot's going to be a real real star. We don't yet. Where is it? It is. It's not really widely available for sale. What's the status? Oh, I hope you get one. OK. Thank you. Everyone's very curious about Jeff's role these days. What kind of executive chair he really is. He said when he left that he'd focus his attention and energies on initiatives that he really cares about as at Amazon, but from the outside, it looks like he's really focusing on philanthropy. He's focusing on space. What kind of an executive chairmen is he? Well, Jeff is always going to be involved. And I feel very lucky to have been at Amazon for 25 years. I feel very lucky to have worked directly for Jeff for 20 of them. And we have a really close relationship and have for a long time. And I think we share a lot of the same values about customers and how important it is to optimize for customers and how high standards they need to be given how easy it is for people to switch and the importance of invention and speed. And so I just feel very lucky to have had the chance to work so closely with him. So is your relationship? I mean, he was your only boss for 25 years, right? Is your relationship fundamentally different than it was when you were the head of the audience? Of course, every single job you have, the relationship's different. Remember, the first couple years I worked for Jeff, I worked as what we call the shadow then, which is really like a teeth of staff. And that was different than when I was starting AWS, which was different from when we got AWS going. And it was a business that was starting to do well. And it's different when I'm in the CEO role. But the constant has always been that we have a great relationship and we collaborate really well. Amazon is poised to become the biggest private sector employer in the world. Second, right now Walmart is in that spot. But Amazon will probably soon surpass it. First vote to unionize at an Amazon warehouse. I know you've been spending a lot of time at warehouses. When you look at someone like Chris Smalls, who I think some people look at as this modern day hero who got fired, pulled off this union vote, what's your message to someone like him? Your message to the folks who think maybe we should join a union? Well, I think that the first thing to be clear about is that employees get to make that choice, whether they want to have a union or not. They always have had that choice and it continues to be their choice. And we happen to think they're better off without a union for a number of reasons, including the fact that it's much harder when you have a union to have a direct relationship with your manager and to get things done quickly. So if you see something on the line that you think could be better for your team or you or customers, you can't just go to your manager and say, let's change it. There's a whole process in bureaucracy that you have to go through to be able to do that. And when there's a union, we're going to get the feedback filtered by what the union decides is worth bringing up. And we'd much rather hear from every employee whatever is on their mind. So I think if you want to continue to have the structure that we've had for all this time, you have to have really competitive benefits. And then I think if you look at Amazon's, they're very unusual in this space. We championed the $15 minimum wage several years ago. The starting salary is now over $18 an hour, which is more than double the federal minimum wage. You get full health insurance and 401K and up to 20 weeks of parental leave. And if you want to get a college education, you haven't had one. We have a career choice program that lets our fulfillment center associate be able to do so. That is a very unusual and compelling set of benefits. And those were all accomplished without a union. So I think that we realize that we have to continue to work on the relationship with our employees. And we need to continue to provide the right benefits. And we need to continue to work on safety. And that's our intention. You made a huge mark on Amazon with AWS, obviously. What is the mark that you want to make still?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,767,2022-11-19 05:51:02

The FTC has revamped its antitrust inquiry into Amazon and by some accounts is accelerating it. Are you preparing for an antitrust lawsuit from the FTC? If you are a large company that's growing to a significant extent like we have, you have to be prepared to be scrutinized. And we have known this for some time, you know, many years. And we have tried to run the company with that in mind and knowing that if somebody looked, that we would stand up to that scrutiny. And I think that's what we've tried to do in running the business. We can't control whether organizations spring different suits against us. But I think if you look at our business, if you actually look at the fact, if you take out of the equation that there may not be the most objective leadership when it comes to Amazon in that organization, if you look at the facts, you know, in our retail business, we're about 1% of the worldwide retail market segment share. And remember, 85% of us is still offline. And if you look in our AWS business, we, you know, about, depending on you measure it, 95% of the worldwide global IT spend is on premises. You know, and then we have a cloud business and then we have a portion of that. You know, we were leading market segment share in the cloud part of this. But we operate, you know, who we compete with, AWS is really on premises, IT in addition to the cloud. So, you know, these are relatively small percentages of the entire pie. And you can kind of step through all the businesses. And I think simply because you've been successful in a few different businesses, doesn't somehow mean that you have unnatural market power. It just means you've been successful in a couple different customer experiences. But we still have a relatively small amount of market segment share in those areas. What about the SEC or being sued by them over third party data and how you've used it? Do you think in the past Amazon made mistakes with letting employees internally see how those third party sellers were doing? Well, yeah, we have pretty good control. I mean, you know, we, of course, disagree with the premise of that. But I would say that we have very good controls with respect to the market. With respect to the data that different employees sets are able to see. And by the way, I think that we can be better for sellers. You know, I think that, you know, we can have better tools from the get started. We can have better tools from the manage what they're doing across their different Amazon units. I think we can communicate better. There's a whole bunch of things we can do better. And we agonize over every single email or communication we get from sellers. We regularly robust surveying and a lot more sellers are happy with Amazon than unhappy with Amazon. And I think if you look at what they're able to do as a business by virtue of selling an Amazon versus not, it completely changes what's possible. Sellers don't really long for e-commerce software.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,768,2022-11-19 05:55:17
18155," Business by virtue of selling on Amazon versus not, it completely changes what's possible. Sellers don't really long for e-commerce software. That exists in lots of places and it's not very expensive. What they love about selling on Amazon is that they get access to our hundreds and millions of customers and that completely changes what their prospects can be in terms of the businesses they're building. So we have a lot of work to do there, like we do in a lot of other places, but I think we have a very strong partnership with sellers. What's the view of the supply chain right now and how much pain there is going to continue to be and for how long? Well, I think that there's a lot of challenges in the supply chain still. I mean, it's gotten better than it was, but there are all sorts of challenges. Non-parasurable goods, electronics, chips, there's still a really significant issue for all sorts of businesses. We have worked really hard to open a lot more points of presence and ports and increase our capacity and getting products in, but I think it's going to be something that companies battle with for some time. You made a huge mark on Amazon with AWS, obviously. What is the mark that you want to make still on Amazon? I mean, in this new role, what's going to define the Andy Jassy era? Well, I don't really think of it that way, Emily. I mean, I don't think it's really about Andy Jassy or any one person. And by the way, AWS was not about any one person. If you spend a time on AWS, that is an unbelievable team, not just an incredible leadership team, which it is, but just top to bottom. The number of inventors and people care about customers and operate something where it has to work almost like a doubt. It's always teams. And so I look at every single one of our businesses and take our retail business or our consumer business, which is the oldest of our businesses, 85% of it still lives offline. I think we have a lot of upside and a lot of growth. And I think as much invention as we've seen the last 25 years, the time I've been there, I think it's going to look small compared to the next 25 years. There is a lot for us to invent on behalf of customers. And so I'm excited to be part of the team that makes that happen. We are continuing to increase the amount that we give back to the communities in which we have big presence. And that really matters to me. I think we have a responsibility to do that. So it's a long journey that we're working on, but I'm excited to be part of it. And I hope to talk for a long time. Well, thank you for joining us and telling us about the way the journey is going so far. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Thank you so much. Thank you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,769,2022-11-19 06:00:06
18156," Okay. It is crucially important and I think we've moved from this attitude, from its indulgence, a waste of time, almost an illness that needs a cure. For something as universally important to human life as sleep, mysteries surrounding its necessity and utility have only just been recently uncovered. Some of our biggest discoveries were in the 1970s or 1980s and so it makes that a really exciting field because it seems as though we're uncovering new insights each and every day. Some scientists are going further to find out how sleep and what happens there can be harness to further expand our understanding. It's easy to memorize things that makes you smart if you can spit back a lot of facts but if you want to be wise, if you really want wisdom, you've got to know when and how and why to use that information and that's what you bring figures out while you're sleeping. Welcome to the Earth Shop Prize Innovation Summit. I'm Francing Lackw here at the Plaza Hotel in New York City. This event powered by Bloomberg featured finalists selected by the Earth Shop Council, launched by Prince William, is a global initiative that drives innovation on solutions to climate change and environmental issues in the following categories. Protect and restore nature. Clean our air, revive our oceans, build a waste free world, fix our climates. So over the next half an hour we'll bring you all the highlights from this most important gathering. This is Bloomberg. Protect and the environment was of course close to my grandmother's heart and I know she would have been delighted to hear about this event and the support you're all giving our Earth Shop finalists the next generation of environmental pioneers. Together in this room are the people and organisations who will help us to achieve the Earth Shop mission to repair, restore and rejuvenate our planet within this current decade. That mission is not simple. Just as President John F. Kennedy so famously said as he challenged the United States for America to unite behind the goal of putting man on the moon, we choose to do these things not because they are easy but because they are hard. I know that the world is an uncertain place right now that many families and communities across the globe are facing unimaginable challenges from conflicts to energy crisis and food shortages. While addressing these in the short term we must also remain resolutely focused on tackling the greatest challenges that threaten our tomorrow. Because if we don't the changing climate will only serve to entrench these immediate challenges into fundamental global issues, severely impacting the lives of each and every one of us. That is why our collective mission is so urgent but there is huge reasons to be optimistic. The 2021 cohort of Earth Shop winners and finalists is evidence that we can succeed. That we can protect our world for our children, our grandchildren and the generations that will follow them. These pioneers exemplify the leadership needed in this decade of change. They include inspiring activists, brilliant innovators, a forward-thinking city and even an entire country.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,770,2022-11-19 06:04:03
18157," Why the leadership needed in this decade of change, they include inspiring activists, brilliant innovators, a forward-thinking city and even an entire country making a real difference. But they cannot do it alone. This must be a team effort. We must come together behind their innovative solutions to ensure they reach their full potential with pace and scale. While my message today is one of gratitude and encouragement, I also acknowledge that you cannot succeed in isolation. As governments, we have a responsibility to create the incentives and the space for you to flourish, a receptive environment for change and the accountability that comes with guardianship. In many nations, the foundation for this approach has been laid for us long ago if we choose to listen. Where I come from, I'll tear down New Zealand, a beautiful place you must visit. Our indigenous people hold a world view that every single living and non-living thing is connected. Our people, our plants, our animals, descendants of Ranganoi, the sky father and Papa Tuarnuku, the earth mother and their children. And so it follows that people and nature are kin, are family. And we must care for one another in the spirit of Kaitiaki Tanga, which translates into guardianship by the people of the land for the next generation. In short, koha-ho te tayao, koha-ho, I am the environment and the environment is me. Our life source, our economy, our future. Now, I've seen this in action first hand many times, not least in my own backyard, the Pacific, where the ocean is a source of protein, income, culture and connection. Now, it is a source of challenge as it rises up and begins to inundate small island nations. It can be confronting to hear and see the stories of just how real these challenges are, but none of us are here because we have given up, but because we believe there is a way to change the future. We are not only part of the nature, but we are nature. Nature is living element. For indigenous people, nature is whole. Our planet is alive. The rivers are her blood. The trees are her hair. The soil, her skin, the wind, her breeze. And indigenous peoples, our planet they know, they are the doctor. We are protecting 80% of the world's biodiversity because our way of life do not harm nature at the opposite. We are strengthening ecosystems. We improve biodiversity by cooperating with the birds and trees, listening to the winds, observing the cloud, learning from even the little insect. We protect nature by setting up our own limits. We don't take more that mother earth can give and we give back. We protect the sacred trees. We don't destroy the field of the medicinal plants. We choose, pre-susely, the animal that we can kill to just keep the balance of the ecosystem. As all of us know in this fight, no one can afford to sit on the sidelines. No one can claim that climate change is somebody else's problem or to get off for future generations to address. We're all affected by a warming planet. We see that every day. And decisions being made right now will determine our shared tomorrow. So we must choose and we must act as united nations ourselves. Our progress depends on collective action, on collective ingenuity. If we stick together, we can make fixing the climate the greatest project and greatest achievement of our lifetimes. We have the science, we have the solutions. Now all the world needs is political will. Together we can create a future.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,771,2022-11-19 06:08:15
18158," is political will. Together, we can create a future where rampant carbon is removed from the atmosphere, where green buildings and green business transform the levability of communities, where easy access to renewable energy enables greater equity, where sustainable agriculture feeds a growing global population. The needs are urgent, and the costs of inaction are worse than any nightmare. But let us be driven by hope, not fear, by optimism, not despair, because hope is not passive. Hope is the ultimate source of renewable energy, pushing us forward every day to try and try again. Today, the Earth Shop Prize Innovation Summit in partnership with Mike Bloomberg and Bloomberg Philanthropies will ask each and every one of us what we can do to accelerate progress to repair our planet this decade. And offer solutions on how to collaborate to drive this ambitious but essential climate agenda. We will continue to drive impact around system-changing climate solutions and amplify the Earth Shop Prizes call to accelerate progress to repair our planet through collaboration and innovation. But most importantly, we will remind ourselves what can be achieved when we turn pessimism to optimism and optimism into action. Coming up, more from the panelists and finalists here at the Earth Shop Prize Innovation Summit. This is Bloomberg. MUSIC Imagine simply climbing a cable into space. The concept is known as the space elevator. Not only could it significantly change how we leave planet Earth, but it could also completely transform humanity's relationship with space. And they're a scientist who think we could have already built it. We have the material. We have the technology. We have the lasers. We have the climbers. We have all of them. If a private entity wants to build it or a government, they can build it. It'll change society. We have no clue how colonizing in the space, how really spreading out of the space, really change our society over the next 50 to 200 years. It'll be completely different. MUSIC MUSIC MUSIC MUSIC MUSIC MUSIC Welcome back to the best of the Earth Shop Prize Innovation Summit. The guests featured ranged from heads of states to leaders of grassroots environmental organizations. Well, amongst them was philanthropist and Microsoft founder Bill Gates. Yeah, it's too bad you can't do things overnight in either mitigation adaptation. You know, when I last went through Europe, people were the leaders were all saying, hey, give me technologies so I can tell Putin to get lost. And I said, hey, in five years, you're going to be able to call him up. And they were like, no, we'd like it. No. It's a year alone. OK, that, how's your planning permission regime and all the planning for that future? MUSIC",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,772,2022-11-19 06:12:36
18159," Well, it's the year alone. OK, that, how's your planning permission regime and all the planning for that future grid? Seeds, typically, between the timing start and they get out in the farmer's fields, is about eight years. Now, we have a pipeline of innovations. We've been funding this CG system for 20 years now. It's funded about a billion a year. People care at all about adaptation. That thing will be funded at two billion a year. I mean, there won't be anything close to the impact of climate-related seeds, climate-related maize, rice, wheat, sort of a millet. And thank goodness, because of human genetics, we know how to do the editing. Thank goodness, because of AI, we know how to find the alleles. Because of drones, we can measure stuff in the field. So there's huge advance in terms of how the whole seed ecosystem moves at full speed. The timing is very tricky here. The warming doesn't stop the day you get to zero emissions. There's a lag in this system. It's about a 20-year lag. So you haven't seen that Earth Tempestor's not equilibrated to the atmospheric CO2 content. So when you get to zero, it's not like 2051. Take my air conditioner away. No, it starts quite a bit later. And so you have to look at what the peak is. And you can't just plan for OK, 2030. 2030 is where your main production in central Africa is down 25%. By 2050, it's down 70%. And you will have switched in most of those areas from a fairly heat-sensitive crop to Sorghum. Now Sorghum productivity is super low. So we'll get people to do better maize for these next 15 years. And then they are going to have to switch to Sorghum. It is tough when you see the floods in Pakistan. I mean, nobody expected that. If the goal of climate was to make us pay attention, wow, that is way beyond expectation. So some adaptation money literally will just be disaster recovery money. The boundary of what is also pretty confusing. I mean, what is food aid? If climate's causing some production losses, all world-proof program money is that all climate adaptation money? It's certainly the need for it's going up. That's a system that's about 6.5 billion a year, so relative to the systemic solution, which is the research piece, it's relatively larger. But the demand for that piece, which is the acute half of Pakistani rice, got flushed away. And so I do think we're going to bring some rigor to this because the pressure now, the goal of doubling the adaptation money from, they say, 20 billion here to 40 billion here, the pressure on that is the- Still peanuts. No, it's very small. I mean, literally, yeah, if you start sticking food aid in there, you can use it up very quickly, rebuilding after hurricanes. I mean, we had hurricanes before, but the costs there are absolutely gigantic. There are ways of stopping wildfires, there are ways of dealing with sea level rise. So the innovation agenda, not just on seeds, the innovation agenda is going full speed on mitigation. That's where there's 100 companies break through energy's funded. And by mitigation, you mean mostly energy. You mean everything to do with energy. You mean generation of energy, you mean batteries, you mean transport, you mean all of the new, and there's some renewables that are already traditional, but more that need to come on. So that's the package that you're talking about mitigation. Or are you also talking about agriculture as mitigation? Yeah, so every area of emissions, you know, the world tends to...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,773,2022-11-19 06:17:05
18160," Yeah, so every every every emissions, you know the world tends to focus on past near cars and electricity That's not a third of emissions and so the focus on the easiest third You know now 4% of new cars are electric You know, so that's the field that we're further still long about 4% of energy generation is wind and solar and As you triple the size of your grid And you want that to be say and you know some people would say 100% other people might say 70 to 80% You know the amount you have to build were you know not within a factor of 5 of the build rate of those But those are the easy sectors cement, you know clean cement costs over twice as much as The way we make cement today and it's not it's partly the heating energy. It's partly the basic Thing you know remember in chemistry when you take calcium carbonate heated you get calcium That's what makes a man that the thing that goes away that's CO2 and so we have to have a Way of making cement which a number of these innovative and steel and iron. Yep. There's a whole family of hard to obey sectors That's true if you get a That industrial sector If you get green hydrogen that's cheap enough it actually solves quite a large number of those Some of the industrial processes should go straight to electricity and some you go through you do your reduction using the The hydrogen where you would have used some Hydrocarbon concept before for steel. We actually have companies doing both. We have Electrosteal and others doing electricity is the way of Replacing the blast furnace and then we Have others that take hydrogen And if you get the hydrogen cheap enough you get the super magic thing Which is that the green product doesn't cost more that's called green premium equals zero and then your adoption Scale is utterly different if we tried to subsidize steel and cement They say rich countries say okay. We want to get rid of that which those two are 15% of emissions That's greater than all for an aid budgets put together. It's over 200 billion for an aid, you know never Will pass that number it's just not politically possible It's a number that's at about 170 and going down today Coming up but more from the panelists and finalists here at the earth's shop prize innovation side this is Bloomberg What do you think of when you think of a battery? For most it's what we use the power devices for both work and play and maybe even your car Over the past few decades they've gotten way more powerful long lasting and affordable But all of this is just a prologue to what the next batteries are going to do as we drive to a Increasingly renewable power driven grid. We also need to be able to store energy and release it later to cover those periods of weather Interminencies that are driving this new grid that we're in It's a Multi-trillion dollar opportunity and it's imperative that we figure out the solution here How we store energy on a massive scale is in many ways the central challenge of the fight to stop climate change You will shed light on dark matter You will make aging optional You will turn 5G up to 11 because when you subscribe to Bloomberg you won't just get news You'll get insight into limitless possibilities knowledge and inspiration to feed your ambition So before you invent pioneer disrupt before you change the world Bloomberg Welcome back to the earth shop prize innovation summits finalists of the",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,774,2022-11-19 06:21:25
18161," Welcome back to the Earth Shop Prize Innovation Summit. Finalists of the annual award appeared alongside special guests, including worldwide business leaders, philanthropists and non-governmental activists. Now while the 2022 finalists have been announced, our panelists have their eyes on the future and here's what they have to say. This is the Earth Shop Decade. We are in a race to repair and regenerate the planet. Some will focus on policy, some will focus on activism. We are focused on supporting the game changers, the innovators, the entrepreneurs and the problem solvers. We believe in the power of human ingenuity, grit and determination to create solutions that if scaled could repair the planet. We have only 8% of the ocean protected today and our Earth Shop is, as Pati said, 30 by 30, 30% of the ocean at least, 30% of the ocean protected by 2030. We know that if we protect the right 30%, not only will we prevent the extinction of many marine species, but also we will produce more fish. This will be this protected area, as we produce a spillover that will exceed the foregone catch. We will have more fish to eat, food security, livelihoods for people. We know that for every dollar that we invest in a protected area in a marine reserve that produces 10 dollars in economic output and creates more jobs. It's a triple win for marine life, for food security and for climate and of course for the economy. That's the goal, the mission to, in the next 8 years, and that's where the Earth Shop is pretty crazy. In the next 8 years, we need to quadruple all the ocean protection that has ever happened in human history. Are you optimistic that I can be done? I am optimistic, there's no choice. I've seen firsthand the potential that a breakthrough idea can hold and if we start seeing more of these transformative solutions across all the challenges facing our planet and suddenly our Earth Shop won't seem so improbable. The work will be difficult, it will take extraordinary resources, determination, partnership. But we've got all the essentials right here in this room. So what is the challenge? It's the speed, scale, and cost of making these green hydrogen generators. Well, that's exactly what we are working on. Because to make green hydrogen the fuel source of the future, it needs to be cheaper than fossil fuels. And that means, electrolyzers are going to need to be really, really cheap. If you want to take a solution around the globe as quickly as possible, you need to make it standardized, mass-produced commodity. A product that is easy to make and quick to build and cheap as well. Some believe electrolyzers need to be large machines. We believe the electrolyzer should be a standardized, mass-producible product that can make green hydrogen anywhere for anyone. In 2030, we imagine millions and millions of projects on restore and not just places on Earth where we see nature being brought back, but all of the other nodes that are key to ensuring success. So the technology providers, the nurseries, the seed banks, the funders, the government incentive programs, so that we have an ecosystem that really allows us to leverage the many, many connections within the nature-based solution space. And in 2030, we have been focused on another key area which is cities and cities require data and insights to take action on climate and to preserve nature, to create more nature and tree canopy. So we've set a goal that we want to- We want more nature in cities, exactly. Exactly, right. And we- so we've been partnering with cities like Los Angeles to give them insights utilizing AI and geomapping on where all the places that you can create more tree canopy, which reduces urban heat islands, improves air quality sequesters carbon. So we want to bring-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,775,2022-11-19 06:25:45
18162," AI and geomapping on where all the places that you can create more tree canopy which reduces urban heat islands improves air quality sequesters carbon So we want to bring data and solutions to bringing nature into cities as well as of course preserving and restoring nature And so one of the goals that we've said is we want to enable over 500 cities around the world I know we're going to hear from the mayor of a Paris after this to reduce a gigaton of carbon emissions by 2030 and so that's through data tools and sites whether that's evolving transportation systems or planting new tree canopy so that's a big bold target that we want to see achieved by 2030 Anyway, I guess I'm in the wrong place. I came here to invite all of you to the Grouch Convention But it turns out you're all about my least favorite thing helping Oh You've got me Oscar. I do like helping people learn how to reuse Repurpose and recycle Together everyone in this room can build a world where nothing goes to waste and that includes even you me Sorry, my guy I got to get going to that convention, but Just between us. Yes I do have a recycling bin right next to my can but no, I think it out okay. It'll ruin my image But my father believed in the power of the idea and Over time the vision the purpose the courage it embodied has inspired each generation to take on its own challenges Not because they're easy, but because they're hard President Kennedy understood that the effort to land on the moon would bring out the best in us That everyone would have to contribute that it would require innovation creativity teamwork commitment and faith and That world would be better because of it The earth shot prize has inspired the same spirit of optimism and ingenuity on a global scale To tackle the most pressing challenge we now face repairing the planet My family and I are so excited that the Prince of Wales will honor this year's earth shot prize winners in Partnership with the John F. Kennedy library in Boston a city that is committed to scientific excellence Environmental justice and the fight against climate change We're proud that President Kennedy's moonshot legacy still inspires hope and we look forward to welcoming all of you who are working to ensure a better future here on earth And that's all from the earth shot prize innovation summit you can find complete coverage of the event including full interviews and articles on Bloomberg dot com. I'm froncing like well from New York and this is Bloomberg What do Formula 1 cars and your local supermarket have in common? Well strange as it sounds they might both be using the same technology A lot of innovation has trickle down from the world of high tech engines And it hasn't just found a new life in road cars F1 cars have long been thought of as the peak of cool and technology in them is also helping to pull down our produce Isles engineers from Williams are using their knowledge from nine constructors championships Working with company aerofoil to help reduce the energy consumption of supermarkets the device their building is based on the design of an F1 cars rear wing It attaches to fridges to keep more cool air in the unit. They estimate it can reduce supermarket energy consumption by 25% one innovation from F1 is also helping hybrids reduce their carbon footprint That's curves or the kinetic energy recovery system in common parlance It's known as regenerative braking and works by storing energy of the car Decelerating in a battery for later use if that's not enough F1 is now looking at hers or a thermal energy recovery system Looking to harness the heat produced from breaking and the engine exhaust That could allow cars to generate the same power using 30% less fuel So while F1 may have a reputation as a gas guzzler some of its innovations in the name of speed are helping in the everyday fight against climate change",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,776,2022-11-19 06:30:08

Japan's critical role in the global economy is changing as the world recalibrates. After decades of stagnation, Japan's leaders are forging a more innovative and sustainable path forward to revitalise the nation. Corporate giants, policymakers and pioneers tell us how they're doing just that. Every week on Japan ahead, right here on Bloomberg Television. No one covers the world like Bloomberg. Writing's on the wall for the bank of England, just oil has spray painted the front door. Recession in Europe, UK and possibly the US. The millions that are out in full force celebrating election victory. A former president, Lula, that's Yolanda. With unmatched reach in resources from more than 120 countries, the moment news breaks 24 hours a day. Bloomberg, your global business authority. The global appetite for data is growing faster than ever. And no matter what statistics you use to describe it, big data is big business. We believe 150 billion devices will be connected by 2025. And more than 175 zetabytes of data will be created. Every 18 month, the data that is produced by the world is doubled. We started talking about petabytes and exabytes. And now we're talking about zetabytes. It's a near unimaginable explosion in data and companies just don't know how to manage and secure all this new information. There's also a growth in the nature and location of data as well, you know, extending beyond structure data to unstructured data. We're looking at 500 plus billion in revenue in a market that several years ago or a decade ago didn't really exist. And that's going to three acts to 1.5 trillion in 2030. Are there room for more players in what has been on already pretty competitive space? What you see right now is that the big players are the biggest nancy tech. You have the chemist like Microsoft, Google, Amazon is the big three. But the great thing about cloud and the public clouds, the private clouds, is that it allows a lot of innovation to happen. HPE is a big name tech company with the mission to innovate and compete in the cloud. CEO Antonio Nari told Romain Bostic why he chose Tarek Robyade as CFO to drive this transformation. When you play sports you want different type of skills and capacities in many ways that they all together can deliver a better performance. And it starts by will to win. And when I became CEO I realized I needed a different type of CFO. Somewhat is way more strategic not just on the accounting side but really think about how we can deliver the value in a different way. Gone are the days where the CFO is just a scorekeeper. I think our role as CFO is to be the person who assisted CEO change the score. Well he had that attracted me was about the transformation experience. Obviously has more than two decades as a global leader. We both Italians by the way, by the core, which I think is a benefit. We can communicate the same language. And we can argue against each other but always in a constructive way. Cinqaqa Belogio. Cinqa Belogio, the man who is on Belogio. As CFO, I would assume that you're always in a position where sometimes you have to say no to him. Do you say no to him? Ultimately decision making ownership is he's the CEO of the company. He's the boss, he's my boss. At the same time I want to make sure that I watch his back. Tarek Robiyade is HPE's chief financial officer and also oversees the company's strategic function. Being the head of strategy, he does a lot of the market.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,777,2022-11-19 06:34:29
18164," strategic function. Being the head of strategy, he does a lot of the market scanning, looking at the trends, you know, whether it's three, five, ten years. And that's why we combine both the CFO with the head of strategy, because in the end, it has to deliver the whole value. And then we hone into what are the big trends, where to play and how to whip. Think about it this way. We are like biologists. We need to deeply understand the financial DNA of our company. And we need to take the proactive steps that prevented it from aging. Finance is the lifeblood of any organization, just like for a human being, you have to have your heart functioning. We have to be there providing the information that allows us to continue to create value for our shareholders and making sure that our customers get what they want. In 2015, the Hule Packard Corporation split into two separate companies. HPE Inc. primarily makes devices from desktop and laptop computers to printers, tablets, and point-of-sale systems. Hule Packard Enterprise, or HPE, provides information technology solutions. In 2019, CEO Antonio Mary announced that the company would pivot from a focus on servers and on-site storage systems to its cloud software as a service platform, GreenLake. HPE calls it a hybrid cloud platform, not just storing data in the cloud, but managing it across murid locations. When I became CEO in 2018, I said that the enterprise of the future would be edge-centric, meaning where we live, where we work, cloud-enabled, and data-driven. And one of the things that we saw through the pandemic is that the enterprise became way more distributed, people working everywhere. And at the same time, data became the most important asset that customers have. Explain for a second the difference between the edge there. Why that is sort of more useful, and the idea of a more centralized sort of cloud system that I thought a lot of companies, at least at one point, were embracing. Well, if you think about, we live now in a hyper-connected world, everything is connected. To digitize your enterprise, you need to be connected. It's cheaper to move the cloud to the data, and by the way, more secure. Right. Then moving data to the cloud. And that's where we, as a company, we are creating the capability to consume cloud services at the edge in your data center on a bigger cloud. There was a view, and there still is that view, that the whole word is going to move to the public cloud. We think the world is fundamentally going to be hybrid. The edge is where everything happens, is where people generate data or companies generate data. Think about, for example, logistics companies. How much data is being generated in harbours, in railroads, in warehouses? And the world we're living will be a world which will be much more automated than ever before. So warehouses are going to fundamentally change. They're going to be powered by robots. They're going to be powered by robots. And then the robots will be very quickly picking up the items in the warehouse that are required, and then re-shuffle what's in the warehouse. That actual processing requires data analysis locally where the action happens, transmission of that data, or a secure network, onto a central point, or multiple central points for that matter, and made sense off. And the whole idea that we're after. With more data to organize in more places, businesses are moving swiftly to digitize their information infrastructure. Corporate spending on IT soared in 2021, and even if global growth slows, that trend is not likely to reverse. How do you operate that environment if we are facing recessionary headwinds? Expanding is we're expecting flattening to single digit growth, but cloud computing will largely be unaffected by that, given the explosive nature of data organizations simply need cloud. Some of these that once invested heavily in devices and data center servers may now seek more flexibility from software that can be upgraded as new needs arise.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,778,2022-11-19 06:38:53
18165," These that once invested heavily in devices and data center servers may now seek more flexibility from software that can be upgraded as new needs arise. That's the bet HPE is making as it pivots to software as a service. When you hear the word as a service, so many companies throw that out, something as a service, is that just a buzz word? At the core, it's a different business model. At the heart of it, there is this contract with a service level agreement that ties the two parties for a specific solution. The solution allows the customer to manage the infrastructure and secure a specific business outcome under certain performance conditions. We manage the infrastructure on your behalf. We grow and expand the infrastructure as you need, grow and expand in turn. And so the degree of customer intimacy is a quantum leap above the transactional world. With a different business model comes a different metric for measuring success. Annualized run rate or ARR has become the focus for Tariq Robyati and his finance team. The ARR is critical important. The ARR is actually measuring the amount of our revenue that is locked in and recurring with our customer base. And to the extent that the ARR is going fast, the more robust the future of the company is. And on Green Lake, we have to grow customers. We have to grow the revenue we make from those customers. And the ARR is the annualized run rate of revenue that you have from one period to the next. If your offer has a perennial future, it translates into a growing ARR. This is the way for us to truly understand that we remain relevant for our customers over the long term. What about margins? When you hear from some of these analysts, these investors here, there's still dialed in on gross margin, some of the more traditional metrics. Gross margin for me is the most important metric in our sector. It's fundamentally, if you think about our business which comes from a hardware heritage moving into as a service, with hardware commoditizing, you have to have a focus on gross margins. And as you can see from our results over the past nine, ten quarters, our gross margin has been expanding very, very solidly. That actually tells you that your customers are willing to pay a premium for what you have to offer. And so what you want to see is a combination of ARR with gross margin expansion and the ARR composition becoming richer and richer with more differentiation thanks to software. That's the journey that we are all. We need to remind people that 75% of our profits are deferred, which means we don't need the impregnate profit to deliver. So that's an opportunity because we have an amazing profit pool called HP.Next. Now being supplemented with HP Green Lake, which we already have more than $6 billion in the balance sheet, growing at 100 plus percent every quarter. Supply chain challenges and geopolitical turmoil have weighed on earnings in 2022. But with demand for its software continuing to grow and a record breaking backlog of orders, HPE has caused for optimism. Meanwhile, Surgeon inflation remains a wild part as the company tries to attract subscribers and maintain margins. We have had to think about inflation permeating across what we do. And what we purchase and whether it's goods or services, we've seen rising costs. We had to therefore be much more disciplined on pricing than ever before. This is not easy and this is also something that has to adjust because you cannot keep pricing increasing all the time. So you've got to be very dynamic in the way you think about pricing moving forward. Coming up, why a company with deep roots in Silicon Valley just opened a new headquarters in Houston and how it designed its campus for a more flexible future. It's really incumbent on us employers to make sure that we create an environment where our employees feel at ease to come to work. They feel supported.

18166," Poisре HPE Chief Financial Officer, Tarek Robyade, originally trained as a scientist, earning a master's degree in nuclear physics and electronics. He told Romain Bostic how those studies set him on his professional path. It did prepare me in terms of my analytical capabilities, but there was a moment in my career where I felt it was really important that I had home my financial skills. And then eventually I had to do an MBA majoring in finance and strategic analysis and entrepreneurship. I discovered finance as a discipline. I loved it and ever since then I became a finance person. Highlights from Robyade's resume include a stint with Lehman Brothers in London and later experiences CEO first with the telecommunications firm CSL in Hong Kong and then with Australian Financial Services Company Flexi Group. He came to the US to service CFO at Sprint, leading the company's turnaround efforts. I was very lucky I had the opportunity to work in Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Asia and the United States. So I'm truly a global citizen. People ask me, where is home? My answer to that question is, home is where I'm not. Home for HPE is now just outside Houston, Texas, where the company opened its new global headquarters this spring. For CEO Antoni O'Nary, the campus is a passion project. I love design, I love art and I felt this was an unique opportunity for me to start with a blank sheet of paper. This was a piece of Latin, nothing. There was nothing here. And it's remarkable in two years we're able to build this 500,000 square feet side with a unique experience digitally enabled in everything we do. HPE has an abandoned Silicon Valley, a number of employees and business units remain based in the Bay Area. But Naree and Robiotti believe the expanded presence in Texas strengthens the company, operationally, financially and culturally. We felt that we have a lot of opportunity to streamline and make the company way more efficient. The reason to move here is to get the best of both worlds. Having a presence here in Texas allows us to recruit and retain talent. Particularly on the diverse side of the house, people don't realize that Houston, Texas is the most diverse city in the United States. In this side, we have a 25 megawatt data center where a lot of the development gets done from all over the world. The energy cost is significant here in California. I would now be able to sustain that in California. What we're seeing in a more macro environment is that corporations are looking at locations that have a healthier business environment from taxation to regulation. They're looking for places that they can find new talent. IT talent is scarce. What we're finding is that access to talent is still the biggest bottleneck to productivity. And so companies on an increasing basis, whether it's Texas or other places in the United States or even globally, are working more towards this hub and spoke model where they might have a center of excellence or a hub in one individual city outside of the main headquarters. And increasingly, we're finding that is happening outside of Silicon Valley. It was a big decision, but it actually, if you put it in the context as to why we made the decision, it actually made sense. So we had a longstanding presence here in Houston for the past, I would say, 20 some years since the compact merger. We bought a piece of land. We started building this building. And in doing so, we had to also recalibrate how we were building it because the pandemic hit us. And we thought about recreating a work environment that is very, very different, that is catered for this new structure way of working, which we call edge to office, where people don't always come to the office to work, can work remotely from their homes, their edges. But have to come back to the office",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,780,2022-11-19 06:47:38
18167," actually act like a whip, a bullfip. Now the way a bullfip makes that cracking noise is because the tip of the whip actually goes about twice the speed of sound. OK. And that crack is a sonic boom. I think the way they got a date was to impress the females by making loud booms. Hey, so you've got to explain this one to me. What does it mean when the White House says we're watching markets carefully? It means they have a Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. They have. I've been in and seen it. Lots of Bloombergs. Lots of Bloomberg. Lots of Bloomberg. Lots of Bloomberg. Lots of Bloomberg. Lots of Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. What does it mean? What does it mean? What does it mean? What does it mean? It means they have a Bloomberg. When US jobs numbers are released, Bloomberg brings you crucial data at terminal speed and instant expert analysis. Nobody covers jobs day like Bloomberg. As HPE moves forward with its strategy to deliver software as a service and gain subscribers on the Green Lake platform, its growth and customer demand is encouraging. But supply chain disruptions have slowed the company's ability to fulfill those orders. It's a problem that's plagued many industries since the onset of the pandemic, compounded by the war in Ukraine. Nobody including HPE is going to have an easy time with the supply chain. I mean, we started the Justin Time concept in the 70s and it's taking years for organizations to back their way out of that and find a more distributed supplier base, a more local supplier. Tarek Robyade can't wave a wand and clear the backlog all at once. He told remainbostic, he's focused on long-term solutions. The world is a longer flat. And that's a practical reality we have to record. And in that context, therefore, it's really important that we get close to where our customers are. And so we have to rethink our network of manufacturing plants. We have to rethink our network of our suppliers. And I think the whole world and the whole IT industry has to find a new equilibrium with supply chains that are designed for speed, resiliency, and cost as opposed to just be inefficient and designed around cost. Our goal is to create a supply chain that is very much designed for optimal visibility at every point in time of where components are, where the working progress products are, and have the ability to shift production and materials in different contents where we operate. So for example, we invested in a manufacturing plant in the Czech Republic, because it made a lot of sense for us to have a presence in Europe. This is a really a new reality that we have to navigate. It's not like we went backwards on capacity. In fact, capacity has been added. The issues that demand has all pays any capacity that we ever imagined. So now we need to add capacity. Also, we need to transition some of the technologies to the newer nodes, and that takes time. Tarek Robyade will play a key role for HPE as it retools to face new challenges. Romain Bostick asked him what skills the CFO needs to truly succeed as a Chief Future Officer. The first quality you need to look for is CFO. It's almost stable stakes. It's integrity. It's not about being honest or dishonest. Of course, we're all honest. But it's integrity of thought in the way you present the fact base, which is the data. If you don't have that in a CFO, stop looking, move on. That's the first and foremost thing. The second most important thing is the ability to do a strategic agile. It's absolutely critical to be injecting in the work that a CFO performs a strategic thinking. The third, I would say, if you think about it in these terms, we are a little bit distorts of the resources of the company for the company and for the CFO. We've got to make sure that resource allocation is up to scratch and that we are allocating resources where there is the biggest return possible. And finally, we also have to be coaches. We have to coach our colleagues and team members and my job and the way I think about it is we have to handle this centered message of analysis. This is the first landscape we have to communicate andнее that you incorporate and that will further move forward. In a annealing situation you're not an successfulKY-USG-SENTUAL",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,781,2022-11-19 06:55:05
18168," where there is the biggest return possible. And finally, we also have to be coaches. We have to coach our colleagues and team members, and my job and the way I think about it is we have to shine the spotlight on their strength. But also at the same time, make sure that we understand our weaknesses and are clear about the areas that we need to improve. So a lot of the CFO job is to distill what I simply would say is tough love. It's about being tough right matters and also be encouraging in other circumstances. What's the opportunity here for HPE over the next 10 years? The opportunity for HPE over the next 10 years is to redefine the industry. And because we firmly believe with Antonio that the future of the industry is edge to cloud. And I think that there will be a growing acceptance and it starts already, you have evidence of it, that the future is hybrid and that the future of an enterprise is to become essentially a digital service provider. The pandemic has taught us that the enterprises who perform the best during that period were the ones who had digitized their business models. And for an enterprise to digitize their business models, they have to think about it, edge to cloud and where the company to help them do so. What do you think is going to be the main challenge for HPE over the next 10 years? Well, I would say the main challenge is ourselves. We have to really be recognizing that the opportunity is there for the taking and we have to go after it resolutely and fast. We can't really wait, be complacent, and not execute aggressively to capture the opportunity. So it's not to us really. And we think with the right focus and with the right team, we can get there. How do you expect your role as CFO to change over the next 10 years? My role is constantly in change mode. If you start with a view that the world is in constant change and you have to adapt, you have to anticipate on what comes next. Strategic thinking is very key for that purpose. You also have to make sure that your team is geared towards it, that you understand the demands that this constant change puts on the team. And then you also have to continue to polish your stamina, build a great that you need to continue to navigate the journey. For someone who maybe got promoted to CFO today, what would you tell them? To just for the first day on the job, what's the best advice you can give them? Enjoy it. It's wonderful. You have a unique vantage point. Any company to truly understand what's going on? No one else in the company has access to the data that tells you what's going on. Have fun. For Romain Bostic, I'm Taylor Rags. This is Bloomberg. At some point, you had to fight for the trademark, right? For the red salt. Is that stressful? Very stressful. Very stressful. Especially, we are a small company in a way and we have to fight people who have those huge companies who put you 27 lawyers on your back for something which is very stressful. I wish it didn't happen. Everything which happened to me is less than in a way, bad or good. Once it's done, it's done. And I'm sort of happy about it. That thing, I could have definitely avoided. But it's done. Did you realize at the time when you started the company that you would become so successful and actually so big? No. When I started the company, I wanted to have a shop in Paris, which is my hometown. And I wanted to do pretty shoes for pretty girls. That was my goal. And now you look back and you say, actually, I still make pretty shoes, but for many more women. Yeah, absolutely. Do you think you would've been so successful without the red salt? I think the red salt definitely, of course, participates to my work, but also to the fame of my shoes because it's instantly recognizable. But then the design is very important. But definitely, when you have such a strong sign of recognition, it participates to, yeah. Big, expensive cities have a lot going for them. But if you live in...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,782,2022-11-19 06:59:10
18169," Yeah. Big, expensive cities have a lot going for them. But if you live in one, you probably notice that these big, expensive cities keep getting more, well, expensive. You could always move away. You might have just started working remotely, so there's really nothing keeping you there. But then again, moving is a hassle. Well, what if someone paid you 10 grand to do it? What if they threw in free office space, a bicycle, or a gym membership? Programs and cities and states around the US are doing exactly that, and they're getting a lot of interest. We had over 50,000 applications. About 90,000 applications. We had over 1800 applicants from all over North America. So are these nascent programs actually beneficial to their communities and the workers joining them? Or are they little more than flashy advertising campaigns for places looking for an injection of fresh talent? I think that's a good idea. But I think that's a good idea. I think that's a good idea. I think that's a good idea. I think that's a good idea. Bloomberg has enhanced search on the terminal to deliver what you need when you need it.

Can it sustain its normal at a time when everybody else is facing a very different way out? Bloomberg surveillance be informed, be prepared, be ahead of the game. They're at the vanguard of a green transition. They're delivering locally in a time of global energy turmoil. Utility companies are having their moment in the sun. Energy is on every once in a while. Energy independence, energy prices, energy availability. Utilities historically have been viewed as stodgy, slow moving, boring companies. I would not be here if it were anything like that. The utilities that are going to thrive in this environment are the ones who have a diversified energy mix. Particularly the ones who have a high percentage of clean energy resources that is reliable such as nuclear, as well as wind and solar and gas in the mix to back those up. Duke Energy, providing regulated gas and electric services to about 10 million customers in seven US states has flourished in the spotlight. Revenues have rebounded since COVID rocked the industry in 2020. The volatility that's driven profits has also created pressures. We're in a period of inflation. We're in a period where commodity prices are high. So every season of leadership is going to have some particular challenge. And Duke will meet these challenges with fresh leadership. After almost a decade at the helm of finance, Steve Young decided to step away from the role. In September 2022, company veteran Brian Savoy became CFO. Why now retire from your position as CFO? I thought it was time. It made a lot of sense. Brian was ready. Succession planning is something that is ongoing at Duke Energy. And this gave us an opportunity to promote Brian, someone who has great financial background, good market and economic background, who also has led businesses, so understands P&L. And so it just felt like the right time to begin that transition. The transition in the C-suite comes as duken barks on a transformation of its business.

18170," Shape its portfolio around natural gas, nuclear power and renewables. We're basically rebuilding generation and transmission and distribution to meet the needs of the future. We're going to invest $145 billion over a decade. That is a staggering amount of money, which means it's a staggering amount of things we've got to go buy, replace, install, make work, and do it in an affordable way for our customers. That's a tall order. It's a team effort. The boy will have plenty of support from Young, who's now Duke's Chief Commercial Officer and Lynn Good, who is one's Duke's CFO herself. Any advice you want to give him? Your CFO hat. C.E.O. Hat, you can't give advice. The CFO hat. The advice I gave him was jump in with all fours and make this job as big as you can, because you sit at the nexus of so many things in the chief financial officer role. The business, the regulation, the finance, delivering value to investors and to customers. I think Brian is very capable of doing that. It's an amazing time to be in this role in this moment. Stressful? Extremely. And daunting. There's a lot going on, but I wouldn't have it any other way. Here's what Duke's power generation mix looked like in 2021, with coal and oil nearly a quarter of the portfolio. Here's how it should look by 2030. Renewables will more than triple as a share of the company's power output. We have been putting pieces in place in our regulated business for several years to really accelerate this clean energy transition. Renewables bring price stability because there's no fuel. My teeth is a sunshine or the wind. There's typically a significant capital of front investment, but it's predictable. Natural gas is needed to balance the grid and the reliability needs because the wind doesn't blow all the time, the sun doesn't shine all the time, the batteries can't bridge the gap enough. So our plan is to reduce natural gas over time, but use it as a bridge fuel as we proliferate renewables and nuclear has been just a tremendous benefit for our customers. And we see promise in future nuclear in the 2030s as we move through transition. That's not the only transition Brian Savoy will manage. Duke wants to focus its time, money and resources on its regulated businesses. And it's looking for a buyer for his commercial renewable energy holdings. Our commercial business is one that I ran, so I'm very familiar with, and it served us very well. But it is only 5% of our company, right? And our regulated business has a clear path to growth and the competition for capital's fierce inside our company. And there are a lot of interest. There's a lot of money wanting to invest in green energy. They are performing a strategic review right now of this business. And I think it makes sense to do so, right? Because in the utility space to really get credit in evaluation for a non-regulated business, such as renewable generation, right? You have to do it at a much larger scale. And it does make sense to take a closer look at maybe somebody else's a better sort of capital here in the recycled capital to redirect that into the regulated business. Duke forecast earnings growth of 5% to 7% through 2026, driven by a lot of capital investment. The company intends to spend a whopping $145 billion in the next decade, with a lion share going to changing its energy mix and modernizing its grid. Brian Savoy is in charge of deploying this capital under highly challenging conditions, including the highest inflation and most volatile energy prices in decades. When you give a surprise like high fuel prices, we need to adjust things like O&M. And so work with operations and the relationships I have throughout the company are positioning me well to help influence our operators to adjust their cost as we need to for customers. Do you feel that reducing costs right now while also increasing spending is different than in the past because of the inflationary pressures because of the energy transition? I would say yes. There are a lot of pressures on the business that we might have had in short spells in the past.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,784,2022-11-19 07:07:48
18171," I would say yes. There are a lot of pressures on the business that We might have had in short spells in the past But it feels more systemic that we're gonna see you know inflation for some time Higher commodity prices with the kind of volatility if someone comes to you So hey Brian, so I need some more money for my division to do this Are you like the no guy or are you able to be really nimble and make sure you can be the yes guy? I would say I'm the how can we? Okay, but we if we say yes to a request that was Emergent we got to say notice some other things. So how do we prioritize and make it all work? CEO and former CFO in good knows how hard this balancing act can be I think at any time you're trying to balance you get pulled in various directions There will be a pull to Build more renewables by certain of our stakeholders There will also be a pull not to go that fast because it could be too expensive may be our industrial customers are worried about price Full-on-a-roll customers worried about price so trying to strike that right balance with policy makers with customers with investors is Is a challenge in any moment and they'll be a challenge in this one I'm taking inside some of the conversation you guys are having a Duke right now So you and Lynn and and other C-speak executives sitting around a table when you guys talk about most right now Supply chain has been a moving target of issues right last year at this time We were Looking at solar panels and how do we lock in our solar panels that we need for the next several years to ensure we can Execute the clean energy transition it has moved to different components like transformers Which are essential for the grid interest rates and the pace at which the Fed is moving interest rates is something we talk about each and every week and And when will that flatten out and how will that impact our business? We are a very large debt issuer So we watch this extremely closely because it affects our cost structure Do you want to wait until interest rates level off and then is that delay your capital raising to deploy your plan? We don't wait, but we do plan, you know when there's Opportunistic times to to issue debt. We will go with larger Component larger pieces or versus smaller and we can work with the length of the debt right if 10 year is Price more attractive than 20 or 30 will will use the tenor to optimize the interest rate. That's all I knew yeah yes Coming up Ryan Savoy takes me to the room where it happens an expert teen gathers data and makes decisions that keep dukes renewables Running smoothly. They're looking for the smallest change in output because every megawatt hour is money This is Bloomberg Access the financial world on demand Here from leading economists policy makers and industry experts be alive and on demand webinars only from Bloomberg Start exploring to see what's moving the markets Visit bloomberg.com webinars I Brian Savoy is taking on a new challenge as he steps into the CFO position at Duke Energy It's really just his latest challenge. He's touched virtually every area of the company over the last two decades I started my career at Duke in Houston and our trading business And I was with Deloitte Toos before I joined Duke Duke was one of my clients. You know what I saw in Brian was tremendous enthusiasm and energy He was ready to take on new assignments He was thinking about advancing the ball for the corporation As opposed to any personal goals and that and that came through He helped us on a number of complex projects and the more we gave them the more he continued to grow I've had five different roles in ten years and I've seen different parts of the company from You know transformation leading natural gas and commercial strategy This has prepared me for the role I have today. What's the advice that you've given him? You know, I've told him a couple of times You're not going to get a home run at every at bat. There's going to be days worth",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,785,2022-11-19 07:12:06
18172," What's the advice that you've given him? You know, I've told him a couple of times that you're not going to get a home run at every at bat. There's going to be days where things go wrong. Be patient, be calm, keep your eye on the ball for the future, the thing you want to get to eventually. You'll have bumps in the road. Fixing things that go wrong and smoothing out bumps in the road is what customers expect from energy providers. And for Duke's renewable assets, that process is overseen from one room in an office building in Charlotte, North Carolina. Ryan Savoy showed me around the company's Renewable Control Center. This is where our operators are monitoring and managing over 5,000 megawatts of renewables across the United States. How would this differ from like a conventional assets monitoring center? Yeah, so assets historically, they would have the monitoring center on site. So you might have an operator with screens, but at the site, whereas this we can do 90 sites. There's offshore wind, onshore wind, solar, and they're looking for the smallest change in output because every megawatt hour is money. You put an asset in, let's say it's 100 megawatts, right? You expect to get 100 megawatts each and every hour that the resource is there. The resource could be sunshine or it could be wind. And when you get 90 or 80, you're not producing what you can. And it can be because the asset isn't working properly. Maybe something hit the turbine blade on the wind farm. Maybe the solar panel has debris on it. Or it could be the solar intensity is not quite there. When one of these assets isn't producing full capacity, we're putting another resource on it. And we're having to toggle this on a consistent basis. And this as clouds come, this is by the minute. This is not, or the hour itself, no, it's by the minute and then it'll fall, come back. And we have assets that follow this digitally as well so that we can keep a consistent flow of electrons on the grid. The operators in this room can respond to incoming data with immediate action, remotely controlling wind turbines, solar panels, and batteries. It's another example of using digital and technology tools to make us more efficient, to make us more productive. By using the amount of people we have to have running around and observing and giving us the statistics to really be able to maintain and monitor those facilities. We couldn't see degradation and output as fast as we do now with the technology and the digitalization of the system. Now we still need technicians nearby. And so we use traveling crews that can go say sites in Kansas versus sites in South Texas versus Central Texas and across the West. We have around the clock shifts, but about 20 people rotate through these shifts. And again, recovering 90 sites, we got about half a dozen people here at any given time managing it. You could think that would scale at over time as renewables grow in the United States. So would you say that as you invest more in renewables, it's a hardware thing or a software thing. Like where do you think we spend the most money doing that? Obviously, the software will continue to improve over time. The sensors on the equipment are very important to, again, identify those degradation and output, but it's deploying the hardware. Deploying the assets on the ground, getting the sites ready, connecting to the grid is a huge lift. Duke's hardware and software mix keeps evolving and so does its workforce. Retooling also means retraining. We've moved people to the renewable space. Some of these folks used to be in coal. We've moved people to cybersecurity, which is a growing area that we need more and more because as everything gets digitized, there's more opportunities for bad actors to penetrate. So we need high cybersecurity skills and when you match that with operating skills, you really have a beautiful mix that makes a strong, strong operator. Operators here have plenty of micro details to keep track of, but there's a macro factor on their minds as well. That's the weather. We have maps in the United States just to give the operators a bearing of what's going on in the country. And we have plotted on it where our renewable sites are. So they know if there's a weather pattern, weather system coming, I expect that in that area. How do you manage extreme weather? So let's say we have a wind farm in the west and the wind storm is coming. »» »»»»»»»»»» ribbon playing »»»»»»»»»»»»2»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»'»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»'»»,»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»!»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»» «»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»'»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,786,2022-11-19 07:16:38
18173," pattern, weather system coming, I expect that in that area. How do you manage extreme weather? So let's say we have a wind farm in the west, and a wind storm is coming. Yeah. You know, the assets will turn off when the wind speeds exceed a certain level automatically. OK. Because there's risk of breakage of the blades and damage to people and assets and stuff. We know a wind storm is coming. That might damage the solar, or a hail storm, for instance, right? We can watch those assets closer. We can put a crew on site. But this team would be dispatching those crews onto the location. And that's where the weather map and the team really works. Yeah. From hurricanes in the southeast to wildfires in the west, extreme weather events are becoming more prevalent and more intense. Utility companies are bracing for greater risk. When we think about the impacts of extreme weather events on the grid, large grid-connected resources would still, such as large-scale solar farms and large-scale wind farms, would still rely on a centralized grid to deliver electricity to the load centers. So to the extent that the grid is knocked out by a hurricane, those assets would go offline as well. So in addition to investing in green generation resources, it's extremely important that companies pay attention to grid hardening measures. We're seeing more of it, more frequency of severe events and how we predict those, monitor those, and estimate the damage using data analytics and machine learning to say, how many customers might be out of this happens, what generators are at risk, and all that modeling goes into our planning for what we put our investments. We talked about the capital plan earlier. All those investments are informed by the climate trends that we see across our system. Coming up, Duke's clean energy plans get a major boost from DC with the Inflation Reduction Act. Brian Savoy is already working through the possibilities. For example, 1,000 megawatts of solar equates to about 60 million in annual production tax credits. This is Bloomberg. Why do the biggest names in business choose Bloomberg? I have to do the great questions. Great question. Great question. Best question I get all night. Bloomberg, top experts, great questions. The paper is crucial, important. And I think we've moved from this attitude, from its and indulgence, a waste of time, almost an illness that needs a cure. For something as universally important to human life as sleep, mysteries surrounding its necessity and utility have only just been recently uncovered. Some of our biggest discoveries were in the 1970s or 1980s. And so it makes that a really exciting field, because it seems as though we're uncovering new insights each and every day. Some scientists are going further to find out how sleep and what happens there can be harness to further expand our understanding. It's easy to memorize things that makes you smart. If you can spit back a lot of facts. But if you want to be wise, if you really want wisdom, you've got to know when and how and why to use that information. And that's what you bring to use out while you're sleeping. You will put a woman on Mars. You will bring forth global cooling. You will be the first chief crypto officer. Because when you subscribe to Bloomberg, you won't just get news. You'll get insight into limitless possibilities, knowledge, and inspiration to feed your ambition. So before you invent pioneer, disrupt, before you change the world, Bloomberg. The next decade for Duke Energy is pretty clearly...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,787,2022-11-19 07:20:47
18174," The next decade for Duke Energy is pretty clearly mapped out. Raise and spend $145 billion on a massive clean energy transition. Put the bulk of those investments into regulated businesses while investigating the sale of non-core assets to fund that push. It'll all be up to new CFO Brian Savoy to execute this plan and make sure it delivers optimal financial growth. The motion is adopted. Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act in August, putting provisions in place that make his task more manageable. The Inflation Reduction Act provides incentives for renewables. It provides incentives for battery storage and it provides incentives for nuclear. All of those incentives for a regulated company go right to our customers. They reduce directly the price of our product. So when I build a renewable product it's going to cost me less and it'll cost my customers less. Our renewable transition, for example, 1000 megawatts of solar equates to about 60 million in annual production tax credits. We're going to have 30,000 megawatts of renewables on our system by 2035. The Inflation Reduction Act has been a very important piece of legislation. It's not only that it creates a number of incentives for a variety of assets, right? It also is very durable in long term. So instead of a patchwork of different tax credits that we've seen in the past, it actually creates a life path going well into 2030s for this long-term transition on the grid. Political winds may shift and regulations are always subject to change. For the moment, policy in Washington aligns with Duke's strategic goals. What's like there's a Pearl partnership now? We have a voice at the table. I have a lot of conversations with the Treasury Department about tax policy and as they define the rules around the IRA, they will seek input from people like us. And we will weigh in. This is what you should think about as you write the detailed rules to implement this act. When it comes to relationship between utility and policy makers and regulators, those have always been extremely important. Those utilities that cultivate have cultivated those relationships in a constructive fashion where they've been good stewards of capital and operate the system well and took into consideration interest of various stakeholders in addition to the equity and debt investors. Those that you enjoy, congratulations to the regulators in our experience, right? And that over time translates into constructive rate outcomes and better recovery mechanism. Recovery mechanisms are set at the state level. They also help companies and customers absorb the capital costs of the clean energy transition. We cannot adjust our price for that working through regulators. And modern recovery mechanisms allow us to adjust price more frequently and align with our investments. So that when the investments start causing expenses, revenues follow and there's alignment. Otherwise, we call it regulatory lag where you have expenses before we can earn revenues on those assets. Historically, we would build up investments, then have what's called a rate case and have a large increase in one one-slug. The modern recovery mechanisms place assets and service each year essentially. So your smoothing rate increases over time. So customers can plan better and we can plan better. Even with meticulous planning and regulatory tailwinds, U.S. utilities must proceed with caution. Europe's energy crisis highlights the fight between green energy and energy security, raising questions about how fast and hard the world can pivot. There's been criticism saying in Europe that they were trying to go too fast into renewables for example. And therefore, they left out nuclear and they sort of shuttered coal plants and now they're paying the price in that respect. What's the right pace? I think the pace is maintaining balance with reliability and affordability. That's the only way we know to gauge pace. We will not put a plan together. We don't have a high degree of confidence. We can serve our customers every hour, every season. And we have to keep an eye on affordability. We call it a responsible balance transition. The transition away from fossil fuels is coming. I mean, just think about coal. Five years ago, you could get as much coal as you want. Now, coal is constrained and it's going to become even more constrained. So operating coal assets is not even going to be an option as we move through time. But the convergence of energy and dependence.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,788,2022-11-19 07:25:10
18175," And it's going to become even more constrained. So operating coal assets is not even going to be an option as we move through time. So the convergence of energy independence and security, I believe, is coming soon. That's the state of play for Brian Savoy, as he starts his tenure as Duke's CFO. I asked him what he sees when he looks ahead. What is the biggest opportunity over the next 10 years as CFO that you're most excited about? Over the next decade, I feel like utilities have a moment to really make a mark on society. And again, it's long-lasting. It's going to be for our grandkids and their grandkids. So putting the utility sector in prominence of the world, that's what I want to do. What's the biggest challenge? What are you most worried about in the next 10 years in doing your job? I think the biggest challenge is balancing investment, the investments we need to make and the transition in front of us with the cost to customers. Because the oversight of our regulators is only getting more and more and more. And we've got to be more clear on the customer benefits of every dollar we spend that turns into value for customers. And I can see this playing out in just hand-to-hand combat over the next decade. And we will work it. And we believe the investments we're making will meet that bar. What is the skill that you have as CFO that you think will help that? I'm wired for value. I don't like waste at all. And when I see things that we need to change, I have the courage to make it happen. And as CFO, I'm in a position to really move that and Duke. And what's a new skill set of knowledge that you're excited about over the next 10 years? I would say the new skill set would be how to balance all of the external views of the company with the internal. I've worked inside this company and have great influence. But ensuring that similar level of influence is out in the external world. What's the best advice you've received coming into CFO? You know, I will go back many years ago. Over 10 years ago, I was working for Lynn. And she told me, Brian, the skills you have positioned you for a wide range of roles. I had no idea what that meant. Then this was like 2009. But as I've looked at my career, and she has moved me to gain experience across Duke in the right areas of operations and strategy, that advice back then, I didn't appreciate, but I appreciate it now more than ever. I'm Alex Steele. This is Bloomberg. We don't have enough women founder CEOs who are getting funding. So basically, less than 2% of VC funds go to women, less than 1% go to women of color. And so in this innovation space, I said to myself, what's the best way to use capital to move things for women? And that's when I started to say, OK, I actually need to move some money into the venture capital space. And I want to do it smartly. I mean, the first goal is to make money. I'm not putting my money out as a social impact. I'm putting it out to make money. But I wanted to go behind funds, like aspect ventures that's run by Theresa Gaugh and Jennifer Fondstadt, who are looking at these opportunities. And they have a thesis around my gosh. There are so many opportunities there if we go towards funding some of these women businesses. Some LPs have said to me, all we care about is returns. Some of the best investors may not be the best people, but they have the best returns. What do you have to say to those people? I have to say you're investing in what you know. And so you need to look at what trends are coming in the nation and how you're going to address them. Women are 85% of consumer dollars spent. Women control 70% of financial decisions in the house. So if you're not investing in products that go towards females or a women led company, you're missing an opportunity because you just don't see it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,789,2022-11-19 07:29:27

In July 2022 Atlanta hosted what might sound like a boring legal seminar. A conference on the new rules around name, image and likeness in sports. But far from dry and academic, the first annual NIL Summit was in fact a flashy star-studded event put on at the college football hall of fame. And mingling amid the biggest current and former names in sports and media, there was a crucial cohort. The player is poised to redefine what it means to be a modern college athlete. And the winner of male athlete of the year goes to Chase Griffin. Among those up-and-comers UCLA's Chase Griffin. The UCLA quarterback is among the students becoming as well known for making deals as making plays. And even in that group Chase stands out. My name is Chase Griffin. What's up everyone is Chase Griffin. It's your favorite quarterbacks, favorite quarterback Chase Griffin. Look at it as an empowerment equity opportunity. It's really been unmatched in the sports world for any point in time since Title IX. Better a scope. After hardly a full year of name, image and likeness deals being a reality, he already has more than 20 deals with major brands, venture and charitable groups. All the while bouncing, graduating undergrad in just two years and fighting for playing time on the field. Chase Griffin out of the gun. We are joined by UCLA quarterback Chase Griffin. Not just UCLA quarterback, but name image likeness superstar. I am sited for this one. This kid could actually be the president of the United States someday. Chase isn't the starting quarterback for UCLA. He's not even the backup quarterback. But back on campus in LA, his nickname is President Chase. And after spending a couple days talking about his approach to business, sports and equality, it's not shocking to think he might someday hold that office. His level of focus and maturity at this stage. I only wish I had. If you want to buy stock and human being, buy stock and Chase Griffin. When it comes to building generational wealth, it's not about the money that you make in college. I'm very excited that I made the amount of money that I made last year. I am even ten times more excited that I know how to make that money.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,790,2022-11-19 07:33:41
18177," that you make in college. I'm very excited that I made the amount of money that I made last year. I am even 10 times more excited that I know how to make that money. Some are on any college campuses mostly for the athlete who are on lighter but still regimented schedules. The tendon class is working out, a little bit of hanging out, and then more working out on their own time. Chase is no exception. The 21-year-old is a backup, albeit an impatient one. In the topsy-turvy past couple of seasons dotted with fan-less games and COVID protocols, he's been able to start three games for the Bruins. Griffin, go to throw to the end zone. Wide open again, touchdown UCLA. He's leading Arizona and narrowly losing to both Stanford and Oregon. That was inches away from Chase Griffin and UCLA, being in full-fledged comeback mode. For Chase, UCLA felt like destiny. He was born just a few miles away before his family moved to Texas when he was a toddler. But beyond being a sort of homecoming, the school's history of athlete activism was a massive draw. I always expected from myself to have some sort of impact that was beneficial for more people than I interact with on a daily basis. And choosing UCLA, a lot of that went into me seeing myself as someone who reflected the same want to make things better, that so many of the people that UCLA prides itself upon being the home for have done in the past. The legacies of former UCLA greats like Arthur Asch, Jackie Robinson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Jackie Joyner Kursi have had a wide-ranging impact on society well beyond the Westwood campus. Chase reveres these people, but he's perhaps most keenly aware of the activism of a more recent Bruin alum, the basketball player at O'Bannon. At O'Bannon, who was the next player of the year National Champ, UCLA Sports Legend is also a legal hero. I think NIO could be the next installment where we look back in 30, 40, 50 years and God willing, if we give him the roses he deserves, we add at O'Bannon to that list of UCLA greats. O'Bannon, who played at UCLA from 91 to 95, initiated a lawsuit that's widely credited for finally opening up the possibility of college athletes being paid for use of their name, image and lightness. He sued the NCAA in video game publisher EA for antitrust violations, arguing that athletes should be entitled to financial compensation when schools used their lightness for game. In 2014, a judge ruled in his favor. I don't think he was congratulating. What was your call? And then, on an episode of the show, surrounded by O'Bannon, Diana Trossi, and LeBron James, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed the first ultimately successful legislation to allow athletes to receive endorsement deals. The fair paid a play act led other states to follow suit and ultimately led the NCAA in 2021 to relent, seemingly reluctantly. NIL payments were officially allowed as of July 1st, 2021. Today is the last day where name, image and lightness laws will not be on the books and kids will not be, if you will, not allowed to make money off of their name, image and lightness. Making money from Jersey sales and endorsement deals is a way for players to share in the massively lucrative world of college athletics. This NIL thing is the wild, wild west. The NIL change felt like many things that happened very slowly and then it happened very fast. And I wonder for you, having contemplated that maybe this was coming at some point, how prepared were you, what was your mindset when the switch flipped? Right. I mean, I still think...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,791,2022-11-19 07:38:09
18178," Prepared where you, what was your mindset when the switch flipped? Right. I mean, I still think everyone's trying to get prepared for the industry. It's still sort of like a wild, wild west. I wasn't really expecting anything. I was more just thinking about honestly getting ready for that season and capitalizing on everything that was happening. When NIO hit and it turned out I had action, I was like, oh, okay, well after this degree deal, which was fantastic. I was like, okay, I see how I can be a staple in this game and I see how I can get better over time. That's why I teamed up with my friends at Shell. I'm then at Shell deal hit and then boost my old deal hit. Then you keep on building clear coverage. You keep on building and you get better in the meetings. And most of all, you start seeing where your value can be best placed in these new opportunities. The headlines and storylines in the aftermath of the NIO change introduced visions of instant millionaire strolling campuses across the nation. You might think the NIO athlete of the year lives in Splendor or at least in one of those athletic palaces that put most of our coach dorms to shame. Well, it's all relative to chase. All right, Jason. So here we are, World Headquarters. Yep, this is where it all happens. There's the kitchen right here. I actually really enjoy cooking. Oh, yeah. Yeah, this gas oven gets really hot really fast. I make pizzas in there. This is the best appliance since the iPhone. If I already put anything in there, I need to do these dishes right here. So no trappings of success yet. More a pretty average college dorm room. The fridge filled with leftovers, a well-used PS4. And of course, the requisite Godfather poster. It's a far cry from the lifestyle seen in some local news reports for NIO athletes during this first year. These are Robinson made headlines with an NIO deal with Lamborghini Austin. Lamborghini's tend to make more headlines than Muhammad Ali or Bruce Lee pictures. Some athletes who are living in mansions driving Lamborghini's. As far as I know, you're doing either of those things. I see where you're living right here. It is with all due respect, not a mansion. No, good. How much of that is a conscious choice? And what does it say about your approach to this? Right. I mean, first off, I look at this. It's my own room. I got everything I need. I'm cool with that. I'm cool with living below my means. I think it's important to remember that the volume of financial gain is completely overstated. And that's what it y'all is following. The media. And someone hears about a $5 million or $10 million deal. You've got to report it. Like, oh, my goodness, people are going to read this. A, I'd count two things. Like, how many kids are even getting these deals? And then for the kids that do get it, how much of that is in liquor cash? And how much of it is in assets? If you pay for a $2 million house out here in LA for a kid to stay in and college, that's great. But as soon as they're graduated, they're not going to have that $2 million. I say the same thing, you know, for the kids who are driving around in Lamborghini's and stuff like that. That's awesome. Like, that's super dope. And I know some of those kids. But, you know, someone paying for your lease is different than someone actually giving you the value of that lease every single month. You're investing in it, saving it for a $1K, etc. I say all that just to mention that product deals and stuff like that are overhyped by the media. And they also can land kids in some trouble if they're not paying taxes on it. That's one of the distinctly unsexy and easy to overlook elements of the new rules. Even if an athlete's not getting cold hard cash from a deal, the value of any products given are subject to state and federal taxes. So suddenly, what a player sees as free year in return for some social media posts actually equals taxable income. And that requires the same forms you'd fill out as an independent contractor getting a check. I made a fair amount in NIO deals and I invested all of it. In my opinion, NIO is great. Doing all this is great. Making money now is great. But the most valuable thing I've gotten from all of this is the fact I always know how to make money off of myself.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,792,2022-11-19 07:42:38

All told, Chase has done more than 20 deals with major brands like Degree, Shell, and Boost Mobile, along with venture-stage companies including Discord, Duffel, and Creative Juice. He's also made a point to work with charities like the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank, where he's already raised funds for almost 60,000 meals. Hydrogen has a very special place in the universe. It's the first element on the periodic table. It is the most abandoned element in the universe. When clean energy advocates think about what can we find which would be as easy to use as fossil fuels they think about hydrogen. The fuel that will, when burned, only produce water. We like to imagine that if we just built enough of these and these, we could ditch fossil fuels and save the planet. Unfortunately, it's not that simple. There are some things where you just need a good old-fashioned combustible fuel. Now, startups around the world are betting that hydrogen can become the fuel of the 21st century.

18180," That was pretty good. 400 above, but they had originally S, so that's a win. So yeah, I mean, at this point after I do a zoom or something like that, I get to chill out and go back to laying down if I was watching a movie or something, or you know, go to YouTube to start looking for more samples. It's a pretty simple interaction for Chase and for Direct TV, negotiated over a couple of emails and zoom calls, and papered with a contract Chase will have his dad look over before he signs. And Chase, who's made himself as much of a student of the new NIL marketplace as he has a public policy at UCLA, says he understands why it's working. A brand ambassador with an athlete is more attractive to these brands announced as a term investment than even a post by a famous actor. If there's any place to learn that sports are deep in the hearts of Americans, it's on a high school football field in Texas. Friday night lights in the Lone Star State might be the great iron equivalent of Frank Sanatra's New York City, making it there needs your something special. And Chase didn't just make it, he excelled. Let's talk about some of the top quarterbacks in the state. And when you look at that list at the top of it, you got to talk about Chase Griffin. I was lucky to play three years as a quarterback for Hado High School, which is a one horse town. We have great success. And so the town really shut down and came out and supported us every Friday night. Chase, one word to describe that finish that game. God, that's it. Coming from a town like that where football is so prioritized, it has its pros and cons, but I think on the pros side, I learned how to win, how to get better, and most importantly, what it's like to build a team where everyone gets better. Emulating his UCLA alumni like Robinson, Joyner Kursy, and Abdul Jabbar, Chase is looking at the impact NIL will have not just for him, but the athletes that will follow. When the predecessors who have come before you have changed the world and made life better for everyone today, you can't help but ask yourself how the actions that you're taking now and the companies and brands and the NIL space that you work with are all cumulatively building something greater than any of us could foresee. I've actually, I've never moderated, so this will be my first time. The last day the conference chase was asked to co-moderate a panel with Monique Nelson, the CEO for UNI World Group. UNI World Group is one of the longest standing multicultural advertising and marketing agencies in the United States. The firm works with brands like Ford, Home Depot, and Johnson & Johnson to help reach the black and brown communities, and they have big ambitions in NIL. For UNI World Group, the idea of this was pretty epic in that because we serve the undervalued, overlooked, and the underserved, we knew that this particular group of people would fall into that category. And we plan on being the premier practice for NIL athletes that are looking to do purpose-driven, media advertising, community level engagement work. UWG launched a program called the NIL to help black student athletes partner with major brands, but to help them understand how to do that, they brought on chase to serve as a student-athlete executive in residence. For me, I do nothing without tremendous amounts of data for all of our clients. I really want to...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,794,2022-11-19 07:51:18
18181," as a student athlete executive in residence. For me, I do nothing without tremendous amounts of data. For all of our clients, I really wanted to be thoughtful about this practice being very athlete-centric. If I were to build it or anyone on my team were to build it, it would not have the athlete at the core. When you're 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, the best way to have credibility is confidence. And the only way for confidence to be authentic. I'm actually learning on the job. I'm learning about the brand side of NIO, but I'm also trying to make sure that empowerment equity is built in, especially for Black student athletes in the NIO world. ROI. Return on investment. Both Chase and UWG see NIO deals as something much more than making money for students. It's also a potential investment in a community long overlooked. I think we're getting ready to stop boxes, trying to feed the people of L.A. A piece of each of Chase's NIO deals go to his belief brand campaign, which has raised more than $13,000 for meals for the L.A. Food Bank backpack program. But athletes giving back is only one side. I'm here with legal zoom to give you five tips on the NIO game plan. UWG and Chase believe having brands investing in the athletes, especially athletes of color, can be a force multiplier for these historically marginalized communities. When you look at the revenue, J-atting rating, sports for the Bon Vast, 88% of those athletes are Black. So when you're doing stuff to empower student athletes in the NIO space, you're also helping to deliver on your promise. Now student athletes are not the only ones who should receive this help by any means. But statistically, by doing that, you're going to be delivering on your mission. Additionally, student athletes on average come from lower levels of income. So you're also delivering on that promise. And a lot of these student athletes are first generation, their first gen college students. Some of them first gen high school diploma. Some of them first time receiving the amount of money that they receive in their families. This has been a wild first year in NIO. We all knew that there would be bags of cash around, right? There's always been bags of cash. There's cash everywhere. What we know is that that's not sustainable. We know that athletics has an expiration date on it. So for us, inclusion ultimately means this is just a part of you. It is a tremendous part of you. And we are going to celebrate that part of you. But we also know that you're bigger than that. So we want to empower you to live past your expiration date for this part of your life. And quite honestly, have equity in everything that you have poured yourself into as an NIO athlete. It may still be the Wild West days for the NIO industry. But in the first year, about a billion dollars in business was done with NCAA athletes. For the early leaders in the NIO space like Chase, they're striking a precedent for athletes that follow them. And that's important because collegiate athletes don't have that much time to profit. But only an estimated 2% of NCAA athletes go on to the pros. Even the hardest working are often limited by things they can't control. For Chase, it's been his height. I'm 5'10 now in high school after my sophomore year went up through for 3,000 yards. I was probably like 5'6"", 5'5"". I mean, I could already say I'm one of the best in the history of Texas high school football. But, you know, I've gone through the height test where they'll call you out of class, shake your hand, look at you up and down. And be like, nice to meet you, you go back to class. It's a sad but timeless story for student athletes. And for Chase, his story is something he's not shyed away from. But embraced when it comes to his NIO deals. I'm frequently the smallest person on the football field, but I always strive to be the most impactful. My middle school coach told me that I would never play in high school. Chase's deals with degrees breaking limit.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,795,2022-11-19 07:55:36
18182," The most impactful. My middle school coach taught me that I would never play in high school. Chase's deals with degrees breaking limits team and clear covers inspired underdogs allowed him to capitalize financially from football. Even the last season, he never saw the field for UCLA. I play football because I love the game. I play the football because I'm a good competitor. I love to compete and I play football because I'm good at it. At the end of the day, I don't play football for my livelihood, which is important to remember when it comes down to identity. I myself chase Griffin as long as I'm that. I got something in this world. As he moves into the new season and focuses more on football than business, Chase doesn't see much of a differentiation between the two in terms of his mindset. I wouldn't be surprised if I wasn't playing football in five years and it was running in Fortune 500 company, but I also wouldn't be surprised if I was winning a Super Bowl five, ten years from now. And either way, I'm going to keep on working at the tools that would align myself and my future with both. At the end of the day, you're always going to have yourself. If you can make profit off of yourself and know where you add value, in any world you're in, you'll be able to adapt and find ways to generate wealth for yourself. Part of what I love about business is you get to build things from nothing. I don't have any investors. All this is all money in. This is me just building it. It's pretty much full service shadow banking with nobody in charge. When the price of anything goes up, the consequences reach far beyond what you'd expect, but perhaps most of all when it comes to food. In 2010, surging food prices helped spark the Arab Spring. Lives were lost, regimes fell and the consequences are still with us. Once again, food prices are rising and fast. Energy costs, broken supply chains and surging demand were just some of the factors that have driven food prices to their first record high since the Arab Spring. And that's all before a war between two of the world's biggest food producers. Ukraine is called the Bread Basket of Europe and taken with Russia the two account for about a quarter of global wheat trade. They produce more than half of the world's sunflower seeds in oil, nearly 20% of the barley. Now throw in rising energy prices and processing, transporting, even refrigerating food gets more expensive. Plus, fertilizer production is extremely energy intensive. Less fertilizer means lower crop yield and prices rise even more. The pandemic revealed how complicated and fragile global trade systems are. Global agriculture, perhaps even more so. Unlike metals, for example, food goes bad. And crops take months to grow and are vulnerable to unpredictabilities like the weather. Rising food prices will be felt everywhere, but the poorest countries in the world will be hit the hardest. And as all these factors compound, the real fear is that record high will lead to record high and ultimately to a global food crisis with vast consequences.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,796,2022-11-19 08:00:02
18183," Vietnam While Tesla's in the light make for good headlines, The reality is that even if every car on the road today won electric, it wouldn't be enough to curb global emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions from transportation account for about 29% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. So what about the other 71%? Building across America burned fossil fuels to operate. What we want to do is make that all electric. Instead of burning oil and gas to give us the energy and electricity we need, we want to do 100% clean energy. All electric. We want to turn buildings into Tesla's. Just like a Tesla or an electric vehicle is all electric with no fossil fuels. We want to do that with our buildings. And if we can do it in one building, we can do it in all buildings. And if we do it in all buildings, we'll reduce 30% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. A week of hope about inflation and interest rates, about China's relations with the United States, about Britain getting serious about its budget. And of course, former President Trump's hope that he can do it all again. This is Bloomberg Wall Street week. I'm David Weston. This week, Special Contributor Larry Summers, on what came out of the G20 meetings in Bali. And former Fed Vice Chair Rich Clarita, on the liquidity problem in the Treasury's market. And what can be done about it? It was a week of hoping. Hoping that things just might start to move in a better direction in U.S.-China relations, after a President Biden's meeting in Bali with President Xi. I absolutely believe there's need not be a new Cold War. I do not think there's any imminent attempt on the part of China to invade Taiwan. And I made it clear that our policy in Taiwan has not changed at all. Hoping that inflation may just be easing a bit in the United States with Fed Vice Chair Leo Brainer telling Bloomberg, we might see a bit of moderation in rate hikes. I think it will probably be appropriate to move to a slower pace of increases. But I think what's really important to emphasize, we've done a lot, but we have additional work to do both on raising rates and sustaining restraint to bring inflation down. Hoping that the new British government has gotten the message, as it put forth a new budget designed to reassure the markets. So today, we deliver a plan to tackle the cost of living crisis and rebuild our economy. Our priorities are stability, growth, and public services. And then, of course, there's that special kind of hope that former President Trump brings to everything he does, deciding that despite what happened in the midterms to his hand-picked candidates, this was the right time to announce he's running again for President. In order to make America great and glorious again, I am tonight announcing my candidacy for President of the United States. Even as prominent investor and Republican supporter Ken Griffin of Citadel couldn't find much to hope for in Mr. Trump's candidacy. He lost in 2020. We lost Georgia because of his behavior in the Senate race in 2020. That's the second loss. And then this year, the Republicans lost the Senate because the Trump-backed candidates in the Senate races were rejected by American voters. That's a three-time loser. And I'd like to think that the Republican party's ready to move on from somebody who's been for this party a three-time loser. But whatever we were all hoping for this week, we didn't really get that much out of the markets, which traded without real conviction.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,797,2022-11-19 08:04:36
18184," This is Pari, a three-time loser. But whatever we were all hoping for this week, we didn't really get that much out of the market. It's which traded without real conviction, with the S&P 500 off just 7-10s of a percent for the week, and the Nasdaq down 1.57 percent, and the yield on the 10 year up about seven basis points ending the week at 3.82. To help us sort it all out, we welcome now a sunny, best-less CEO of Rock Creek and Bob Michael. He's chief investment officer and head of the Global Fixed Income Unit at JP Morgan Asset Management. So welcome both you. Great to have you back. Bob, let me start with you. I mean, I watched the Econ numbers. I listened to the Fed speak. I sort of felt like I was going both ways at the same time. What did you see? Well, for a bond investor, all of us who have been battered this year, this is one of the weeks that made sense to us. We had a nice tailwind coming in from the inflation data. It was great all the way through core. When you look at shelter, everything. Yes, the markets went a little crazy. They went wild. And the central bankers did what they're supposed to do. They came in one by one and reminded us, don't declare victory yet. These are only a couple prints. There are more hikes to come, but maybe there is some optimism. And the market settled down. So I look at this week and I thought, this is the first great week in a long time. So, Sonny, is that the way you saw it as well? And there's still some more red hikes to come. How many? I think at least another three to start with. 50 basis points next time in December, followed by at least two or three 25 basis points next year. And then we'll see from there. And I think what Bob said is very true at the same time as we were listening to at least three fed people come and speak. I wrote down, I think they all had very different coats. And you had some of that when Labour not talked. But you also had the president of St. Louis Fed say something slightly different as if we would start continue with rate increases for a while longer than she had implied. And then of course, we had Susan Collins come in today with even sort of potential 75 basis points. So we're hearing numbers that are a little bit all over the place and trying to make sense of it. So Bob, are the markets making it harder for the fed as a practical matter? They were at the start of the week. I think not so much now. I think we're all in the same spot. We've all got realistic expectations. The fed's headed to four and a half, five percent. They'll get there sometime in the first quarter. We'll see where inflation is. If it's below the fed funds rate, then that gives them some scope to pause on the tightening. We can reevaluate at that point. But right now, bonnyeotes have gone up a long way in a very short period of time. It's time for a breath. Bob, does that get us to a soft landing? Unfortunately, it does not. And I think that's the one consistent message from the fed. Susan Collins aside, which is there is going to be pain for businesses and households. When you have this magnitude of rate hikes in such a short period and you're also withdrawing liquidity through quantitative tightening, it's going to bite. And we're already seeing it's biting the economy hard. Thankfully, it's also now starting to bite inflation. So I want to think about the liquidity. Just for a moment, if I could have some here, how big a problem do we have in the Treasury market now with the liquidity? I hear conflicting things, but some people are very concerned about it. Big problems. I think Bob leaves it much more than I do. But as you know, they're very, very big problems with the trading volumes. And for big traders or even small traders, getting a bit is becoming much harder and you're working in a much less liquid environment. And I know between Treasury and the banks there have been a lot of meetings, but I'm not so sure if we have a solution yet. Well, Bob, could the Fed make it easier with some regulatory changes? It could. But I think the moaning that we hear in the bond market about liquidity, it's always there. We always complain. We don't get the price we want. The reality is, for the last couple weeks, you could have moved your portfolio in any direction you wanted up and down duration, up and down credit risk without any kind of penalty. So I'm not that big a believer in the lack of liquidity. I'm saying we'll talk about it soft.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,798,2022-11-19 08:08:41
18185," you wanted up and down duration, up and down credit risk without any kind of penalty. So I'm not that big a believer in the lack of liquidity. I'm sorry when we talk about a soft landing, it brings me back to oil because oil did move this week and it moved down in the price of oil. And most people I talked to suggested it was in part because of a concern about global recession, really a backing off or at least a softening in the markets. You came out of that business, you really know energy backwards and forwards. What are we seeing in oil? So as you said, oil prices did the future numbers went down below 80, which was a big shift from a little while ago. But my view is still that we might just avoid a recession in the U.S. if we're fortunate. But we may not be able to avoid it in Europe and the rest of the world. And a lot of the, I think, softness for these numbers that we saw today and in recent days is because of the expectations in China. Now China is starting to open up a little bit maybe and loosen its COVID rules. But that's going to take a while and I think that softening is softening the oil markets and will probably continue to do that. Is it opening up? I mean, I'm not exactly sure of exactly what's happening because on the one hand, we hear them saying things that sound a little softer on zero COVID and in any case, we hear about a lot of cases. So it is, it was kind of interesting. We had a team out in Asia this week and they came back with interesting news that there is actually some physical opening up. But now you have people who are afraid to go out because they've been told so long that if they go out, they'll get COVID. And so you think a very different phenomenon, which is actual, you know, individuals not wanting to go out of their houses versus the government, which has been very strict about you're getting out of your house. I'm sorry, I was at the G20, of course, meeting with Mabali and some people thought there would be no single statement coming out of it. They did come to some agreement in part driven by some of the developing countries. Should that be encouraging to investors actually, that we're getting back perhaps a little toward multi-lateral cooperation? Much more positive news came out of the G20 than we all expected. And as you said, there was also a lot of big stress on reform of the multilateral lending because the big news out of that meeting was that there's huge needs when it comes particularly to emerging markets, climate-related investments. And there's no way with the existing finances of the multilaterals that that could be met. So that was why there was a lot of emphasis on the reform of the multilateral sector, but also getting the multilaterals to work much better with the private sector to generate more resources. And you saw that very particular case of Indonesia, which was discussed a lot and written up a lot with about 20 billion going into replace coal in Indonesia with cleaner fuels. About another important development this week, it's sort of a rolling development, is the outcomes of the midterm elections. We found out that the Democrats will hold on to the Senate. The Republicans will get a narrow majority in the House. What does that communicate if anything to investors? Is that sort of a steady as you go way because we have a split government, not much is going to happen either way? So it for sure is, I will tell you, going back to the G20, we're actually hearing from clients, large institutional clients, that they're more confident about allocating to markets when the G20 countries are talking to one another again and working with one another again. So that's a huge positive. I don't remember that in gosh over a decade. When you go back to the gridlock in Washington, I hate to say it, but the markets kind of like it. It's when there are dramatic policy changes. You have to reprice everything in the markets. It becomes destabilizing. There are always going to be some winners. There are going to be some losers. This time, if we know we're going to have gridlock, we can focus on bringing inflation down and trying to avoid a recession and have a soft land. I think a lot of people on the street think it's sort of hypocratic. First, do no harm. If you're not doing anything, you're at least not messing things up. Bob Michael of JPMorgan and I'm sorry, a bachelor's of rock week, will be staying with us as we look at what this week meant for our investment decisions. That's the next on Wall Street Week. I'm Bloomberg.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,799,2022-11-19 08:12:59
18186,"... So what's the best investment advice you've ever been given by anybody? The compound interest, the compounding of returns is an incredible miracle of business, finance and human existence. Everything you learn is additive every day and if you keep at it and don't quit, it's an incredible miracle and it's not just interest. It was always said about compound interest returns, compound business returns, compound human returns. They're all very additive because you'll learn every day and if you keep at it, it's very, very helpful. In your observation of investors, what do you think is the biggest mistake that average investors make? Selling it the wrong time and they sell when the prices go down or not keeping. People have conviction or they invest for if they invest for the right reasons, just keep at it. We think it will create some of the most valuable companies the markets ever seen. I think it's certainly driven companies like Cisco, given then the life that they've had. It's obviously also spectacularly volatile but the market has pulled back in this sector since it came public since it began in 1995. It's pulled back 30 to 50 percent at least seven or eight times. That was Henry Blodget talking about the internet and tech on Wall Street way back in June of 2000 when the number one movie in the country was Mission Impossible 2 and the most popular song in the country was Maria Maria by Santana. Michael of JP Morgan and of Sonny Bachelors of Rod Creek are still with us. So Sonny certainly Mr. Blodget was right that we gave us some awfully big and successful companies. No question about it. Some people thought that would happen as well in the crypto space. This week we're not quite as sure after FTX. What do we make of that? Is that it does that have broader significance of the markets or is it just a one off? Hopefully it is more limited. I think there's no question that without regulation and we've all been talking about having this sector regulated. It would help. It's the market itself but also the investors going in having this particular come you know FTX which is an exchange core crypto. Be based in the Bahamas with not just no regulation but also with a few people who had very limited experience in finance or in anything really. I think the shocking part of it David was that very very sophisticated venture firms from Sequoia and others who were invested. It was not just retail getting involved in that market so it was a surprise but hopefully it will get limited and I think it has put a lot of pressure on increasing regulation sooner here and that will be a good thing for the market. Now let's not forget that the whole market is less than you know at 900 billion. I'm not saying that that's tiny but it's still not significant enough to create any kind of stress in the market unless we're missing something that we don't know at this point. I think what's important David when you watch that clip and that was the absolute peak in in the dot com bubble. Yes there was a massive shake out there was a massive consolidation.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,800,2022-11-19 08:17:19
18187," You watch that clip and that was the absolute peak in the.com bubble. Yes, there was a massive shakeout, there was a massive consolidation, but I would argue the internet and tech evolved far beyond what any of us ever thought it would be in 2000. I wonder if we're going through the same thing with crypto and NFTs that it got a great start. There is going to be a shakeout of Sonya's right. There's probably going to be a lot of regulation, but when I talk to the young people on our desk and our platform, there's still a big believer. And if the millennials are a believer, 22 years from now, they're going to be looking at this clip. And I hope we got it right. That's fascinating. There is no question as a generational issue here. Let's come back to the current generation and people who's old as I am. I'm older than you are, but as old I'm, what about bonds right now? Do you invest in bonds? For the first time in a decade, absolutely. And I will tell you that we're seeing interest from everywhere now. Every wealth management platform in JPMorgan, every institutional client, they're coming to us, they're putting money in bonds, they're looking to commit more, and they haven't done so for years. If I look at where we got to at the start of the year, a general bond fund, the Bloomberg Ag, yielded 1.7%. Now we're up at 4.7%. We have 3% higher yields, and that's going to track investment. And as I said, I think the Fed is close to the end. I don't know if they get to 5%, we're kind of in the form of half, four and three quarters percent. That's going to bring a lot of stability to the market at these levels. Bonds are back. So I'm saying you manage a very amount of money. What about for you, are bonds attractive at this point, or are you just equities? I think as said, what is very interesting right now is even in any foundation or endowment or the assets that we manage, you're finding exactly the same phenomenon where people had moved away from bonds and cash, and we're all equities and private investments moving back into holding bonds. And as we're sort of reaching that 4% percent, that Bob talked about, much more interest in bonds in a more balanced kind of portfolio. And of course, people are looking at cash with 4% at the treasury bills at the level that is much higher than cash, which is in a very long time. But I think the bigger thing that is happening in the portfolios we're looking at is obviously a lot of investors, institutional investors have been also investing in venture private equity, real estate in private form. And I think that is going to some sort of transformation too. Well, let's take a segue if we could from that sort of investment into COP27. As we're speaking right now, it's still going to end on Saturday. Right now, of Sony, you know far better than I do. It looks like it's going to be difficult for them to get to the objectives that they had. You're absolutely right. So far, as we know tonight, the latest news was not too positive. Not things could change tomorrow of morning, but they didn't really have anything major to announce. Again, as you remember in COP26, they had the G-Fans, which was a large number of large asset managers, signing up to make pretty significant shifts in their carbon print. But most recently, they started walking back from that or not wanting to sign quite on what they had agreed to in COP26. So I think it's very, very important, as we're having these meetings, maybe they shouldn't be every year. Maybe they should be every other year or less often, but show some sort of progress. And the most important part of the discussion this time, David, has been a fact that developing countries again have felt that they are in some cases suffering because if they're an island economy, they're going underwater, if they are affected by droughts and by floods. A lot of it might be caused by those who did use a lot of carbon over the last 10, 20 years, and they're asking if they could get help. And that help is really not coming. And I think that is the really major summary of COP27, which is that the expectations of investments of...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,801,2022-11-19 08:21:39
18188," Really not coming. And I think that is the really major summary of COP27, which is that the expectations of investments into climate are probably less than what we expected going into the COP. Well, and just picking up on that on the investments in it, Bob, I want to come back to you, because I want to things at least I'm taking away from COP27. You can certainly hear, listen to John Kerry, the president's special envoy on this subject. We're not going to get to it from public money alone. It's going to take a fair amount of private investment as a bond person. Are there bonds that are green bonds or in the climate that make sense as a business matter? There are. I think for sure, if you're going to finance something, which is what bond investors do, you want something that has something of a green agenda to it. And we're hearing that from our clients, there's more and more money coming into the space. I think Afsania help is on the way for the island economies. The large-scale investors want to commit capital to this space. Well, the inflation reduction act, as it's called, a lot of people object to that title, put a lot of money into the game here on that private side of something. Is it making a difference in the projects that are getting financed? No question. I think the RA is a very powerful act and it's the largest amount of money going in. And I think that will really help us in the U.S. to invest a lot more in climate-related food and ag, in battery storage, in residential, and in community-related solar and wind. So that will be a major, major push. And we're seeing, as Bob mentioned, a lot of movement. I agree with him. I think it's just that in COP, where you expected public money to go in, there was a sort of disappointment with that. But the private sector is doing a lot. The young generation is doing a lot. We just need the public sector to jump in when it comes to it outside of the IRA, of course. Bob, last word, are you seeing a difference in your part of the business for the government tax policy when it comes to green bonds? We are. Yeah, absolutely. It's making a real difference, you see it? It is from our perspective. So, yeah, everything we see, and we didn't touch on the regulation, there's going to be more regulation poking through what qualifies as a green bond or not, and also, you know, to prevent any greenwashing, either in specific bonds or in bond funds. So watch this space. Yeah, okay. It's particularly with the new Congress coming in. Thank you so much. Really great to have both of you with us. It's up to Sunny Bachelors of Rock Creek and Bob Michael of JP Morgan. Coming up, we are going to take a look at next week on Wall Street all around the world. That's here on Bloomberg.

It's time to look at what's up next week on Global Wall Street, starting with Annabelle Dhrulers in Hong Kong. Well thanks David. This week in Asia we're going to be taking a close look at two big elections. Now in Malaysia voting took place this Saturday just over a month after parliament was dissolved for a snap poll. And then meanwhile Taiwan that holds midterms this coming weekend. So that's going to be a pulse check on the popularity of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party. Of course we see geopolitical tensions continue to rise in the region. Eco wise the highlight is on central bank meetings in Korea and New Zealand. And we're going to be live from Seoul for the B.O.K. with expectations there for a half point hike. Plus the RBNZ predicted to deliver its 6th straight 50 basis point move. The 2022 World Cup kicks off on Sunday in Qatar. The tournament is being held in the winter for the first time due to the blistering summer temperatures in the region. Thursday sees rate decision by Sweden's Riksbank. Economist forecast a 75 basis point hike. But surging food prices could tip the bank to raise by even more. We'll also on the same day get an account of the ECB's most recent policy meeting. And last certainly not least you energy ministers will be meeting to discuss policy outlook as Europe heads into the winter. A holiday shortened week for the observance of Thanksgiving Day. The main focal point for the week. The local center around the release of the FOMC minutes from that November meeting. A meeting that saw the Fed raise interest rates by 75 basis points for a 4th straight time. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said then that U.S. interest rates would go higher than earlier projected but several Fed members since have indicated that they may be ready to downshift. A handful of earnings next week to watch including Zoom video, deer, analog devices, best buy and Nordstrom. Keep an eye on those last two for a read on the strength of the consumer as the traditional kickoff to the holiday shopping season in the U.S. begins on Friday. The main theme to watch there will be the flight to discounted items by cash strap consumers that seem willing to spend but maybe not have the same capacity as they did a year ago. David. Thanks to Annabelle Druller's Danny Burger and Romaine Bostic. Coming up we saw it happen in the guilt market. Could a crisis come to the markets for U.S. Treasuries and would it come from a lack of liquidity? We're going to ask former vice chair of the Fed Richard Clarita of Pimco. This next on Wall Street Week on Bloomberg. So really a reminder isn't it just how sensitive the markets are to any commentary about trade. We did see some pressure on the U.S. and we did see some pressure on the futures. That is now being reversed. Okay so you're moving in on me quick. Just stradzing me with your fancy hands.

I'm David Weston. We spent a good deal of this week trying to figure out where the Fed is heading on rate increases. And part of what we were watching was the Fed's vice chair, Leo Brandard, who gave us at least some hope that we might be getting closer to slowing down. I think it will probably be appropriate soon to move to a slower pace of increases. But I think what's really important to emphasize, we've done a lot. But we have additional work to do both on raising rates and sustaining restraint to bring inflation down. We welcome now, Ms. Brandard's predecessor as vice chair, Richard Clarity. Now, global economic advisor to PIMCO. Richard, thank you so much for being back with us. Do you agree with your successor there? Do you think we're at least approaching a point where we might slow down the pace of increases? David, I do. The Fed has done a lot this year. In fact, it will be the fastest pace of rate hikes since the early 1980s. I do anticipate that at the December meeting they'll slow the pace from 75 to 50 basis points. And I think as we move into 2023, I think they think and I agree that they're close at least to a pause, probably in the first half of next year. They said in the November statement, they've done a lot and they want to see how the rate hikes are impacting the economy. So, Richard, you have the advantage of having been in the room and having been in the room relatively recently. Give us a sense of what they're looking at their dashboard, because I'm going to say the economic numbers sometimes point in different directions. On the one hand, we do have some indications like the CPI numbers that may be slowing down a little bit the inflation. They had the overall inflation still pretty high. It is. And you know, the challenge that the Fed faces and other central banks in the world is that the economy is running hot. And in particular, wages in the economy are growing much faster than consistent with the 2% longer run goal. And so, I think that the Fed will be looking at the labor market data. It'll also be looking at inflation expectations. We have downshifted demand growth. You know, there's an imbalance between demand and supply. And this year, demand growth has already downshifted. So, that's an important thing to note. We're certainly along the way to where we need to be. But the Fed has more to do and we need to get inflation back down towards the 2% objective. So, everyone seems to agree there's more for the Fed to be done. We just heard Leo Brenner say exactly that. The question is how much more? And part of the question is, what's the terminal rate? I mean, how far up do we go? We had some somewhat conflicting indications this week, actually. And the banks basically project these things are coming with very different sorts of answers. What determines that terminal rate? And let me ask you, perhaps more pointedly, some people think the Fed was a little slow getting off the market and getting going. Does the slowness of getting started mean the terminal rate would have to be higher necessarily? David, I don't think so. I think what launching the rate heights in March did mean. And I think Chair Powell recognized this.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,804,2022-11-19 08:34:36
18191," David, I don't think so. I think what launching the rate heights in March did meet, and I think Chair Powell recognized this pretty early on, was that it made sense to get to the destination pretty quickly. And that's why we've had the four successive 75 basis point hikes. My sense right now is the committee believes, and I share the view that my baseline view is I want to get the funds rate around 5% if the inflation data comes in on the soft side, maybe four and three quarters. If it comes in on the hot side, maybe five and a quarter, where perhaps is President Bullard indicated maybe north of that. But I think around 5% in the spring will be at a level where they've done a lot. They realize that inflation responds to policy with a lag. And I think that that will be a good place to take stock. So I think that I wouldn't call that necessarily the terminal rate. I hope it is. If the inflation data doesn't improve, then they may have to do more. But I think they will cause at around 5%. So Richard, I think you just put the figure on the thing that at least perplexes me, which is it two-place function. I mean, you've got what the rates are. You also have what inflation is. And how restrictive that is, depends on how far and how fast inflation comes down. So going into the spring, if you're at 5%, how far down do you need to get inflation before you say, okay, that's restrictive enough. But it's an excellent point because typically monetary policy does operate with a lag. So the Fed wants to look ahead. And indeed, for example, Governor Waller and others have made reference to comparing the policy rate to where professional forecasters think inflation will be towards the end of the year. And I appreciate that point. My own research actually indicates that's a simple thing to do. I think the challenge they face, David, is that quite frankly, the Fed's record at forecasting inflation has not been very good, including what I was there last year. And so I think it's going to be a balance between adjusting policy according to both the forecast and the incoming data. Richard, it's not just the rates that are going on. We also have so-called quantitative tightening as you try to run down the balance sheet, which had gone so far up. Give us your sense of what that is doing right now to financial conditions in the United States. Well, David, it is tightening conditions. Again, quantitative tightening is reversing quantitative easing, so the Fed's balance sheet is shrinking. Now, it's been very well telegraphed. And so markets certainly understand the pace and the modalities of tightening. But it is serving to tighten financial conditions. And that's consistent with what the Fed wants to do in terms of raising rates. So Richard, that takes us to a subject that I know you've heard a lot about. We read about all the time, which is perhaps a problem with liquidity in the treasury market. There's more volatility in the treasury market, as I understand it, but that's inherent in raising rates. The question is, is there additional volatility because there's not as much liquidity? We hear at least anecdotally that some people are having difficulty buying and selling large lots of treasuries. Yeah. Well, it's true. I went back and looked. I had the privilege of 20 years ago of serving as assistant treasury secretary in 01 or 02. And in those years, debt outstanding was about $3 trillion, about 30% of GDP. This year, it's $23 trillion or 100% of GDP. So quite simply, the amount of debt outstanding and the amount of treasury issuance is vastly larger than it was 10 or 15 years ago. And the plumbing of the intermediation system for treasury says not really expanded, can commonly with that. And so as a result, there is evidence on occasion of ill liquidity in the market, certainly in extreme cases, as we observed in March of 2020 or September of 2019, it becomes even more evident. And so I think policymakers at the Fed and the treasury and other agencies are looking at ways in which treasury market functioning can be improved. And I think it's certainly something that should be studied and improved. And what are possible options if they do conclude there's an issue there? One of the most supposed to be reversing and going back to quantitative easing, that's one way to do it. And so there might be actually to ameliorating at least some of the restrictions in regulation and repose after the 2008 Great Financial Crisis, which really is an issue that took a lot of the big banks, and it limited their participation in the market. Well, it's right. And so I think that one of the things David that we did in the spring of 2020.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,805,2022-11-19 08:38:59
18192," limited their participation in the market? Well, it's right. And so I think that one of the things, David, that we did in the spring of 2020, is that we did relax, something called the Supplementary Leverage Ratio, in the sense that we would not count bank reserves or treasury holdings against that leverage ratio. The idea is we wanted to encourage banks to lend in the pandemic shutdown. And the Fed indicated when it left those exemptions, lapsed that it would begin, it would review, whether or not it made sense to include treasuries and reserves in that leverage calculation. I'm sure that analysis is ongoing, but I think that's certainly something worth serious study. What is the rationale, actually, for the SLR? I don't not sure I understand it, because I would think the treasuries were as close to risk-free as possible. You know, the history of this is before the GFC, David, we had risk-based standards for banks, and so treasuries are not risky, other bonds are more risky. There was a sense broadly in the global community, not just in the U.S., but through the Basel process in Europe and Asia, central bank and policymakers agreed that it made sense to have a Supplementary Leverage Ratio that typically would not be binding most of the time, but it could prevent, if you will, financial institutions from gaming and entirely risk-based system. However, you know, we discovered in March of 2020 the banks were in great shape. The banks were part of the solution, not part of the problem, and there can be perverse consequences of having a Supplementary Leverage Ratio, especially when the central banks are doing large amounts of key leak. Is the creating reserves, which the system has to absorb? So I think it's certainly something that Fed could address, and I think it could make a lot of sense. Rich, thank you so much for being on Wall Street. I hope you'll come back often. It's really good to have you. You should clear it up of PIMCO. Coming up, we're going to wrap up the week with our special contributor to Larry Summers of Harvard.

Imagine simply climbing a cable into space. The concept is known as the space elevator. Not only could it significantly change how we leave planet Earth, but it could also completely transform humanity's relationship with space. When they're a scientist, we think we could have already built it. We have the material, we have the technology, we have the lasers, we have the climbers, we have all of it. If a private entity wants to build it, or a government, they can build it, it'll change society. We have no clue how colonizing in the space, how really spreading on the space, really change our society over the next 50 to 200 years. It'll be completely different. In the David Rubenstein Show, here to peer conversations, I uncover the untold stories of the world's most successful leaders. Watch Wednesdays on Bloomberg Television. This is Wall Street Week.

Larry, thank you so much for being back with us.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,806,2022-11-19 08:43:22
18193," This is Wall Street Week. I'm David Weston. Welcome back now. Our special contributor Larry Summers of a Harvard to wrap up the week for us. Larry, thank you so much for being back with us. A lot of us spent a lot of the week actually trying to figure out where the Fed is headed, particularly where the terminal rate is. And we got conflicting, I think at least, somewhat conflicting answers out of the Fed, including with Mr. Bullard, the Fed president, saying, well, five, five and a quarter and then put up a chart using the Taylor rule that suggested seven. Where are we? Look, no one knows. I think it's a mistake to be slavish about Taylor rules. The market thinks the number's going to be about five. I look at things and my sense is there's more room for that to be too low than there is for that to be too high. But it's pretty clear that we've had the big moves on this cycle. And now we're going to be finishing that process off. My view is that there's more risk from stopping prematurely and not really curing inflation and setting the stage up for a re-acceleration of inflation after it comes down. I see that as a bigger risk than going too far because going too far would mean bringing inflation down below 2%. And that still seems to me like an awfully remote risk starting from where we are. But I think that the Fed has this in the right place when it says that they're going to move up somewhat more and they're going to take stock of the situation and see what the inflation data is saying and seeing what the inflation forecasts are saying when we get to next, get to the spring of next fall, spring, winter rather spring of next year. I have to say that if they hadn't made as many mistakes as they did of excessive optimism about inflation, they probably have a little more room than they do to rely on forecasts that hadn't yet proved out that inflation was going to come down. Larry, you and I talk a lot about monetary policy, even fiscal stimulus and things, but geopolitics have also factored increasingly and some of the issues having to do with the economy. This week we had what is potentially, we don't know if it is, an important development in the meeting of President G of China and President Biden. What do you make of those discussions and even ongoing discussions because now we have the USTR, a madam tie actually meeting with her counterpart. What do you make of the situation with China right now in the United States? Look, as Churchill famously said, George Aught is a lot better than bang bang. And so the fact that they had a meaningful conversation that lasted more than three hours, the fact that they both came out of the conversation with the sense that there had been satisfying dialogue, the sense that there are some follow-on steps. I think that's all to the good. What it's really going to mean? What really is going to happen? Is there going to be constructive movement out of those dialogues? I think that's something we're going to have to wait and see. But I'm encouraged by what I saw and I think it means that President Biden's whole trip has to be regarded as a success. The United States back in the game with respect to climate in Shammel Shake, the meeting with Xi. I don't think this G20 will be long remembered, but at a very vexing moment, there could have been some kind of breakdown and there certainly was not that. Well, as a minimal thing, I've read some places, people say at least there is a G20 and they came out with a joint communique and it was fairly tough on Russia, I think it's fair to say. And the reporting behind the scenes are, is that some of the developing countries like Indonesia and India help drive that process, which might, I don't want to overread it, suggest that maybe we're taking a half step back toward multilateralism? I think I think we are.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,807,2022-11-19 08:47:37
18194," Overreeded, Suggested, maybe we're taking a half step back toward multilateralism? I think things, I think we are. I think that what Russia has done has really shocked the conscience of the world and has affected very, very many countries. We'll have to see how this plays out. I think we need to remain aware that in the original vote in the UN General Assembly, there were countries with more than half the world's population who have stained onto Russia's side, who declined to join in condemning Russia. So I think we've got a lot of work to do and we in the United States tend to be a bit over optimistic about the extent to which all others see us as the in the benign way that we see ourselves. It's such an important point and it takes me back at least to China because it seems to me that sometimes we've been overly optimistic. I mean, for example, going back to the time we admitted into the WTO, we thought China was going to become more like us and then we go over the other extreme of being perhaps overly pessimistic about China. I guess my question for you is former treasury sector among other things. How do we play both sides of that? We don't know how we'll end up. How do we keep open the realest possibly we can really work closely with China but also protect ourselves against the possibility of confrontation? We in the United States probably need to be careful about our evangelizing influence. I don't think it's really for us to tell China how they should organize their entire society. I think it's for us to stand up for some of our fundamental interests in security, in fair economic competition but to leave it at that point. I think we're going to need to be very careful with respect to our diplomacy on the issue of Taiwan. I think we need to be very careful about about giving China the sense that we are trying to change the traditional one China policy because I think that could risk disastrous conflict. I think the operative words for us need to be respect for them, respect for positions and the fundamental interests that they have and at the same time absolute insistence on our own. I would say one other thing, David, I think ultimately we will prevail in this broad contest with China. I think if and when we prevail it is going to be more than anything else on the strength of our example. That's why domestic renewal at home, whether the issue is scientific innovation or infrastructure, whether the issue is doing something about opiate deaths or whether the issue is strengthening our education system, whether the issue is building on the greatness of our universities or the greatness of our national parks. Ultimately it's going to be our ability to remain the country that's the envy of the world, the country to which people want to come that is going to determine our success. If we change our focus from building ourselves up to tearing China down, I think we will be making a very risky and very unfortunate choice. I want to make a very large turn here. I've had the benefit of talking to you about the masters, about basketballs, I want to talk about Taylor Swift. She's a rather popular pop music star and ticket master because we now know the Department of Justice is investigating possible antitrust problems there because of ticket master which does after all have like a 70% market share that's been under investigation for some time. I don't know if you know much about Taylor Swift although I am concerned about you getting tickets which apparently seems to be difficult but more broadly what is it say perhaps well some of the",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,808,2022-11-19 08:51:57
18195," It's been under investigation for some time. I don't know if you know much about Tyler Swift, although I am concerned about you getting tickets, which apparently seems to be difficult, but more broadly, what is it say perhaps about some of the problems with over concentration in the economy? You know, I wanna say two things about that, David. The first is that if the government made a website, that functioned as badly as ticket masters has here, everybody would be laughing and scorning the government. And so the next time the private sector says that the public sector can't do anything right, this was a private sector building a website, sort of like that to build a website for Obamacare, sort of like they have to build websites at the IRS, or like they have to build a build websites for student loan debt relief. And the private sector utterly failed. And that's something that we just have to remember the next time somebody wants to say everything about government is hopeless. Yeah, we are a country. Well, we have to trust. Yeah, Larry, we're gonna have to leave it there. I'm so sorry, we're a humble, we have much to be humble about. Larry, thank you so very much. It's Larry, some of us are a very special contributor here on Wall Street Week. Coming up, a lot of people get hurt when there's a collapse like that of FTX, but who stands to benefit?

Bloomberg crypto Tuesdays. Finally, one more thought. If Tom Brady's for it, it's got to be good, right? I'm getting into crypto with FTX. Despite that endorsement from the greatest quarterback of all time, the collapse of Sam Bankman frees FTX has brought heartbreak to a lot of people. Wiping out in one fell swoop what was estimated to be a $32 billion empire, leaving what its lawyers now say could be as many as a million creditors holding the bag. And by the way, triggering a class action lawsuit against Tom Brady and others paid to tout FTX to the world. The ripple effects of the collapse of FTX and the rest of Sam Bankman frees empire. Now beginning here as we wait for bankruptcy proceedings. All of which has shaken the confidence of many investors. That's according to Citadel's Ken Griffin. FTX is one of these absolute travesties in the history of financial markets. People are going to lose billions of dollars. And that undermines trust in all financial markets. But as bad as the FTX collapse may be, it's only the latest in a series of major meltdowns we've seen in recent years. Just think back to 2001 when that mythical energy giant Enron hit the skids.

18196," years. Just think back to 2001 when that mythical energy giant Enron hit the skids. Its former CEO Jeff Skilling reflected back on the loss in his later testimony before Congress. I am devastated by an apologetic about what Enron has come to represent. No words can make things right. Too many people have been hurt too much. Or a World Cup. The telecommunications phenom of the late 90s that followed Enron into bankruptcy in 2002 wiping out a market cap of $186 billion and sending its former CEO Bernie Evers to prison despite his trying to seek protection behind the 5th Amendment. I have been instructed by my counsel not to testify based on my 5th Amendment constitutional rights. Or that emblem of the first internet bubble, pets.com with that cute sock puppet mascot which was an instant market hit when it went public. And just as quickly went flop. All of these notorious failures shared a bold vision, a confident leader and a belief that they'd come up with a better mouse trap just like Mr. Bankman freed. And if FTX follows the pattern it will share one other thing with colossal failures through the years. A lot of lawyers making a lot of money despite all the carnage. When Enron went into bankruptcy it had assets of over $65 billion. In the ultimate resolution shareholders were wiped out at a loss of $74 billion. But the lawyers they walked away with over $1 billion along with the accounts. World Cup was three times as big losing investors and estimated $175 billion. While the lawyers were making over $10 million a month in a proceeding to last it well over a year. Lehman was forced into bankruptcy. We made one of the most turbulent periods in our economic history which culminated in a catastrophic crisis of confidence and a run on the bank. But those were all small potatoes compared with Lehman. A bankruptcy that wiped out between $46 billion and $63 billion according to the New York Fed. And netted the lawyers and other consultants a cool get this $6 billion. So we'll see how much the FTX creditors end up writing off. Much less the token holders. As much pain as they're feeling though you can be sure that there's one group that will come out okay. It's always the lawyers. That does it for this episode of Wall Street Week. I'm David Weston. This is Bloomberg. See you next week. I think that it's hard to put your head around any narrative. Let's just be honest. We've had sort of a shift in our way in some sort of sideflation fears moment. People were talking about that all day yesterday. What do you think of when you think of a battery? For most it's what we use to power devices for both work and play and maybe even your car. Over the past few decades they've gotten way more powerful, long-lasting and affordable.

It's a multi-trillion dollar opportunity and it's imperative that we figure out the solution here.

Everything you need to get set for the start of U.S. trading, Bloomberg the open with Jonathan Terrell. Drilling down in the numbers and preparing you as only Bloomberg can, weekdays on Bloomberg. My guest this week has been described as one of the greatest English soccer strikers of all time. As a player, Gary Linnaker scored 48 goals for England and nearly 250 for English clubs. Since leaving the pitch, he's become the face of football coverage here in the UK and is a big vocal presence on social media. When I sat down with him ahead of the World Cup, I wanted to ask him about concerns to do the Qatar's Human Rights Record, the lights of David Beckham doing deals with the state and why footballers can never win. Gary, thank you so much for being here. Lovely to have you. It's an interesting time to talk to you because normally before a World Cup, there'd be a lot of the usual feelings, excitement, trepidation. This feels quite different because of the controversy around where it is. Believe you me, this is the same before every World Cup. There are different levels of it and this is high level but you can go back. You go back to 1934 if you want and when the World Cup was in Italy it was used as a vehicle to promote fascism for Mussolini. This is not new. Brazil in 2014, we were all right on the streets by people in Brazil saying they shouldn't spend all this money on the stadiums, they should spend it on social care. We had Russia who invaded Crimea just a few years before they hosted the World Cup. It's not something we're in accustomed to. Do you think it's on a different scale though because some of the reports of course about the number of lives that have been lost in the building of the stadium and the preparation? I think what makes this different is not just in terms of human rights and obviously workers' rights and what happened to them and lots of lives were lost in the building of stadium. I think what is really different about this one is that we know when the bid was proved to be successful that it was corrupt. I think that's what perhaps separates this from the rest. Human rights wise there's a few countries that have hosted it that would fail some tests on that. Let's go to that in a minute but on the FIFA point because the former FIFA president, CEP Blatter, has now said it was a mistake. You've waited a long time to do that as well. I could have told him that the minute he opened the thing and said Qatar on it. Do you think there's any value in that statement at this point or is it just pointless to hear it? I just don't understand why I would do that now. I don't know whether that helps or hinders or what. He's the ex president of FIFA at a time where there was a lot of dodgy goings on. Yes it was a mistake but it was more than a mistake wasn't it really? FIFA just put out this email. Let's not focus on the politics, let's focus on the football. Do you think FIFA has learned as a body about what's the important focus? I do believe that maybe I'm being naive but I do believe the current people in charge of FIFA. It includes awesome vendors in a really high role. I have certain amount of faith and trust that awesome thing is a decent upstanding non-corrupt person. I don't think there are levels of corruption if there are any. There will be certain branches of faith because it goes it's global. But in terms of the very top.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,811,2022-11-19 09:04:58

18199," Perhaps that thing. It won't happen. I wouldn't put pressure on any player ever to do that anyway. But of course, it's an issue. The human right side of things, it has to be. A Qatar World Cup ambassador has just called homosexuality damage in the mind, which is an insight into the view, the reason for the view. If you were gay as a fat, would you go to this tournament? It's a great question. I don't know because it's a hypothetical question. You would have to give it a lot of thought, I think. I saw one of their main representatives, I think it was Al Tarni, speaking in an interview saying that people, gay people, will be welcome if the question was asked, what about if they walked down the street holding hands? He said that will be absolutely fine. But let's see. But there's a risk. But I understand why people, if the LGBTQ, etc, would have reservations and thoughts and concerns. Absolutely. Whether I, you could say whether I would go if I were gay, I honestly don't know. I don't know. I mean, you are going to work to... I'm going to work, yeah. How are you feeling about that with this? I'm fine, but I don't have the slightest problem about going to work. I'm not going there to support the World Cup being in Qatar. I'm going there to report. Yeah, to come. For me, that's my job as a kind of sports broadcaster journalist. Yeah. As journalists, we'll be sent to the war with Russia and Ukraine, but it doesn't mean they could support what's going on. No, no, no, no, I didn't mean that. But I've meant more like if there was any nervousness, you know, just things like Qatar's UK ambassador's warned against public displays of affection. I'm not saying who are we doing any affection with you. Chance, we are fine, saying, chance. That's very... But also, for the fans, I wonder if you've got a nervousness about that, not just on the human rights side, but the zero tolerance for drinking in public and being drunk. I know. Well, I always have concerns about English fans traveling abroad, because I'm afraid a small... You know, small percentage of them do go there looking for trouble or looking to just get drunk, looking for a fight. And that's been part of something that has... I've been detestable around the English world for years, and they ruin it for everyone else. What will happen to them in Qatar? I don't know if they go along that thing, but I think we've all... I think all football fans, obviously, in their ranks, have the drinking side in their face. Yeah, the drink... Well, yeah. It's a nervousness, perhaps, around the whole thing as well. I'm sure. I'm sure. I mean, I think we'll all be thinking ourselves out if we get a drink at some point. There might be that as well. Many footballers, as you self-become pundits and ambassadors, journalists, commentators. There has also been criticism of, for instance, David Beckett becoming a paid ambassador to Qatar ahead of the World Cup. He's got to promote tourism and culture and Qatar has become a face of it. What do you make of that sort of decision? Well, that's, again, it's a personal decision. I'm not going to sit here and be judgmental. Would I do it? No. Eric Kansenai, obviously, played with him, has spoken out and urged him to think differently. Yeah. And I understand why he's done that. Would I have done it? No. He's decided to go down that route. I would say about David. He's never really voiced his concerns about where the World Cup is, about... So, you know, it's not something he's ever got involved with. If so, can you coos in a bit? He's not hypocritical. If I'd have done it, I'd have... I was very, very anti-the bid when it was first revealed in 2010. I was in the room. I couldn't believe it. It seemed to me that it must have been corrupt because they were talking about staging a summer World Cup in guitar where temperatures are in 40s, sometimes even approaching 50 degrees centigrade. It seemed unfathomable. So, it did... Then, obviously, laterally, it was moved to winter. And I was very vocal against it. So, if I was going to do something like that, I'd feel hypocritical. I don't think you could accuse Beckham of that. You might accuse him of doing something that... you might feel he's fundamentally a wrong thing to do. And a lot of people will think that. Are you disappointed by him doing that, though? Because he's a role model. For a lot of people? He is a role model. As I said, I wouldn't do it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,813,2022-11-19 09:13:42
18200," do and a lot of people will think that. Are you disappointed by him doing that though? Because he's a role model. For a lot of people. He is a role model. As I said, I wouldn't do it. I think also people think why does he need 10 million quid? Does he really need to do that? That's the other question. I mean, I don't know how much he's getting paid, but I suspect he would survive without it. Back in 1997, I was interested in the following question, which is there are a bunch of the dinosaurs called Sorapod dinosaurs, which had really long skinny necks. So Apodosaurus is an example. I also had really long skinny tails. So I made a computer model that showed that in fact, the tail of these Sorapod dinosaurs could actually act like a whip, a bull whip. Now the way a bull whip makes that cracking noise is because the tip of the whip actually goes about twice the speed of sound. And that crack is a sonic boom. I think the way they got a date was to impress the females by making loud booms. Watch Bloomberg surveillance early edition for the news you need when you need it. I'm not a little bit caley lines in New York and N-Edwards in London. I'm a radio central bank. Raises interest rates twice as much as bull cars. Then surveillance for in-depth analysis. Alongside Tom Kane and Lisa Brownbitt, some Jonathan Ferro, the NBA, fronts and cents. How does Japan get away with not raising rates? Can it sustain? It's normal at a time when everybody else is facing a very different way out. Bloomberg surveillance. Be informed. Be prepared. Be ahead of the game. Stay confident. When US jobs numbers are released, Bloomberg brings you crucial data at terminal speed and instant expert analysis. Nobody covers jobs day like Bloomberg. I suppose it's that, you know, the feeling of influence and how people have influence and what they use. Footballers, you know, they become, obviously, sports a massive thing in the whole world anyway. Football, particularly, and just before a World Cup, it is. And there's a lot of expectancy on footballers, but there's a lot of criticism about how much they earn and stuff like that. And footballers do get it in the neck. It's tough to win. Obviously, they have a wonderfully lucrative life, but it's funny. They don't really get the criticism in other people with, in other sports even. You know, you go and earn lots of money like gold for Formula One or you could even go in other routes like actors. Huge actors get earned fortunes, musicians, brilliant musicians. If you're in the entertainment industry, you do get paid a lot of money. But no one else gets that football. It's almost as though it's all these are working class lads. It's a little bit different. Is that what you think is turning on? It might be subconsciously, but I think there's an element of that there a bit above the station. Is it also because they can and do, especially because they're so...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,814,2022-11-19 09:17:57
18201," I genuinely believe it might be subconsciously, but I think there's an element of that there a bit above the station. Is it also because they can and do, especially because they're so young earning so much money, getting into a lot of trouble at times? Like the junk. Well, not many of them do. Not many of them do. So, yeah, not sure what the other thing is. And the other thing is, well, it is absolutely perception thing. Footballers are a cross-section of working class society, really. They come up and it's hard. They have to work really hard. They live very well. Every now and again, a football will misbehave. One out of a, you know, the thousands of them around them. You know, but that becomes a huge story. All the incredible good that they do for their local communities, visiting kids in hospital, doing loads of good things, raising awareness of whether it be racism or during the COVID pandemic. That doesn't become the big story. But what, you know, one player goes out and a drunker and night out and gets pictured with a girl or something, then that becomes like a front page story. And it's a little bit unfair. And that doesn't really happen as much in other areas. It's a disproportionate, I think it's disproportionate. I mean, of course, when Axis, you know, behave badly or things, it also gets captured. But it's interesting to hear you think it is disproportionate. I mean, we should also say that have been some really high profile cases and allegations made against top class footballers in relation to behaviour with women. On the surface, it seems a change in the culture when you were playing around the game. I don't know if that's fair and what you think about that. I don't know. I still think, when I played, I doubt it's that much different now. You'd have... There's a lot more money, I suppose. Well, there is a lot more... Not people not settling down, there's a lot more money. There'd be a lot more dangers and outside interests. I honestly think that mostly, though, the massive majority of footballers would be really good lads, well behaved, work really, really hard on what they do and live properly because you have to now, because it's so competitive. I think it was exactly the same. In my day, you will still get the odd drunk, the odd sexist, the odd homophobic person, like a cross-section of working class society, and the odd person that will commit a crime. But it's not right. It's very occasional limited. I'm not trying to defend the actions of the... I could hear that. I'm trying to get context and perspective of the overall picture of footballers. I suppose, though, the other thing that's undeniable is we still don't have an openly gay male footballer in the Premier League. What could change, or how could that change, do you think, to make that a space where it feels comfortable? I don't know. I mean, it's... Again, it's... I mean, it is distressing. We've seen it starting to see it in other sports, aren't we? But, you know, Tom Daly we've seen. Well, in the women's game as well. In the women's game as well. I just would love it if we had an environment where they just felt... It seems absurd that anyone should... Because also, if you're too much, it's the same who you are. But it's just... I think society thing as well. I mean, I kind of... Probably naively said something in an interview recently. I got picked up by quite a few... Smart gay people, which I've kind of learnt from. I was saying, I honestly think that if a footballer came out, it would be hugely positive, and others would follow. And they... You know, I was kind of told, you know, don't just... You have no idea how difficult this situation is. So, I mean, it's delicate. And it's true. It's kind of baffling, because it's obvious there must be... Lots of Premier League footballers and footballers around the country that are gay and having to live... Not their true... And not be their true selves. And I think that's really sad. Did you like looking back on your career? Do you think you played alongside men who weren't their true selves in that way? Oh, I think so. I think so. I'm pretty sure. I don't know for a fact, but I think so. And do you have young footballers who come to you to say that to you? I've had a couple. Both anonymous, actually. One was very close to coming out. We were... He was actually the secret gay footballer and he was...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,815,2022-11-19 09:22:18

Indeed. I can understand people's reservations about it. It's almost a kind of bit of comedy in a way, isn't it? But there are obviously more serious issues that it was you know, it was a large part of of the early days with you know, so many deaths in COVID and some you know, they they could somewhat throw the blame at the government in terms of the lack of protection, certainly in care homes and things like that. So I don't know. I mean it's not, I might, I don't know whether I'll even watch it. So you're not tempted to do any of those particular shows? You're, you're so... God, Lord, no.

I'd be my worst nightmare. Thank you so much for talking to me. And thank you so much for being with us. Until we meet again, take care and goodbye. I'm Luke Burke. Welcome to Deadbreak Australia. And we just come onto the close. Welcome to Bloomberg Crypto. On TV, Radio and the West. This is Bloomberg. What are the moon shots at Amazon that are capturing most of your time and attention? Well, you know, we have a unique way that we go get big new investments and I'm not sure it's right or wrong. It just happens to be our way and we ask ourselves when we're considering something for questions. We ask if it's successful, can it be big and move the needle in Amazon? Is it being well-served today? Do we have a differentiated approach? And do we have competence there? And if not, can we acquire quickly? If we like the answer to those questions, we'll go pursue it with a single-threaded team that isn't distracted by the rest of the business. When it comes to the stock, it has fallen significantly. Do you think investors are missing something or has tech just been overvalued? I have never tried to predict what stocks might do. In any time, I've tried to a little bit. I've been wrong. I do really believe that in the short term, the stock market tends to be a voting machine and the long term it tends to be a weighing machine. We have a concept we talk about a lot of Amazon inputs and outputs. You know, in the ultimate output for a company, a share price, you know, and then other big outputs are free cash flow or profit or revenue. You can't really manage the outputs. You have to manage at the input level. And that's where we spend all our time. And so if you do the right things for the business long term, things tend to work out. I think we've had very good returns for investors. And I expect that to be true again. Big, expensive cities have a lot going for them. But if you live in one, you probably notice that these big, expensive cities keep getting more, well, expensive. You could always move away. You might have just started working remotely. So there's really nothing keeping you there. But then again, moving is a hassle. Well, what if someone paid you 10 grand to do it? What if they threw in free office space, a bicycle or a gym membership? Programs and cities and states around the US are doing exactly that. And they're getting a lot of interest. We've had over 50,000 applications. About 90,000 applications. You've had over 1800 applicants from all over North America.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,817,2022-11-19 09:30:56
18204," of interest. We've had over 50,000 applications. About 90,000 applications. We've had over 1800 applicants from all over North America. So are these nascent programs actually beneficial to their communities and the workers joining them? Or are they little more than flashy advertising campaigns for places looking for an injection of fresh talent? You could trade anything as a trendfall. You think about Bitcoin? I don't think it's a currency. I think it's a commodity. Today we're in an everything bubble. Genial and unflapable even in the heat of a corporate crisis. That's a reputation of CS Venkata Krishnan. Known as Venkata, amongst colleagues of former Barclays markets chief took over his chief executive after Jess Staley's abrupt exit in November last year. In his first TV interview since getting the top job, we talk about the bank's so-called universal model of retail, corporate and investment banking. So what are the challenges that lie ahead and where does he see opportunities? Will Barclays have to increase provisions for low losses as a cost of living crisis gets worse? Over the next 30 minutes, we talk strategy, investment banking in Europe, the future of the city of London and how inflation will change the banking world with the man who's in charge of Barclays for the lost 12 months. Venkata, thank you so much for speaking to Bloomberg. So 12 months into the job, what have you learned about yourself on the bank? The last 12 months have been a wonderfully educational experience about myself. I've learned how much more I needed to learn about banking, including running a large organization, finding ways to encapsulate what our ambitions are and to convey and get to so many people and then visiting all the spewable footprint of the bank we have. It's also, you know, it's been a wonderful year in terms of the bank's operational performance. We've managed a bunch of crises and we've managed them relatively well, I think, but it's the start. We are in a middle of a tough economic environment. So in terms of strategy, the strategy hasn't changed that much from your predecessor. Is it about execution or is it a different lens that you're looking at it with? So I was part of the team that set up the strategy seven years ago. And our strategy then was to simplify our footprint, focus on building a global investment bank that was, you know, very highly competitive. We are now number six with the biggest European investment bank. It was about doubling down on the UK where we want to be a leading financial institution in sort of everything, retail and wholesale and it is about building up a very specialized consumer business in the US, which we've done. We like the footprint, the businesses are operating well. I think now it is the striving to excellence, which is to make sure that in all the businesses which we do clients and customers know what we are about, we do the things that we do very well. We don't have hobbies, we are very focused, we execute well and it's about excellence. But can you really compete with the US bank in terms of having an investment bank? Can Europe leverage or are you always going to be one step below? So we are competing. We are number six. We have been gaining market share and share revenue share in our markets business for many years. And, you know, we are under no illusion that we are not going to catapult, nor do we want to catapult the number three or number two. But we can be very good at what we do. And if we are good, people will transact with us and work with us and you can make a very good living at the size we are. Do you want to get bigger? Is now if you look at the pipelines and things that are coming through is now the right time to employ more bankers? Two slightly different questions about getting bigger. One is I think that as long as we do well and organically we grow, that's fine. Right? I wouldn't want to take large steps. But if it happens in an accumulation over a period of time, that's welcome because it's gradual. About bankers, I think it's a question more about what sectors of banking? We've made a big push in sustainability and we continue to expect to do that. And obviously, pulling out of some old economies.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,818,2022-11-19 09:35:19
18205," to expect to do that. And obviously, pulling out of some old economy sectors or reducing it not to zero, but there is a shift in the banking wallet and we respond to that. And I think sustainability is very important. Are you expecting more IPOs, more pipelines? You mentioned the environment that's a little bit uncertain at the moment. What does the next 12 months look like? I think it is going to be a difficult environment for the first six to nine months of that 12. I hope by the summer, when people are able to sort of see the end of the rate rising cycle. It may not have happened by the summer, but hopefully you can forecast the end of it with reasonable confidence. Then businesses will feel more confident themselves in what they want to do about their capital raising and capital planning. But I think it'll do a little time before we see that clarity. What's your biggest concern out there on the markets? I know you had some good results. A lot of it has to do with also how you traded. Your traders perform very well. But we have a very uncertain environment. We don't know what inflation looks like, the cost of living. You have exposure to mortgage. There's leverage out there. What keeps you up at night? Well, I think what we've had this year is a series of incidents which would have been difficult to forecast at the start of the year. Even at the start of the year, I think across the industry, people were cautious because they knew we were the start of a rate rising cycle. It's never good for credit assets in those periods. It's not good for equity assets generally in that period. Then you had the Russia Ukraine war. And then here in the UK, you had that little volatility with GILTS and LDI. So there are pockets where there could be leverage. And there are pockets where they may be rapid movements. And in this kind of a rate rising cycle, you would expect to see that happen. So it's rather than being specific worries about certain things, it's being generally aware that you're driving a car when it's rainy and the roads may be slippery. So what does that mean in terms of risk management? What does that mean in terms of you preempting some of the things that could go on? We have been operating through the year with relatively less risk. And what I would call relatively less long-byus risk, meaning expectations of asset prices to rise, then we would normally have done, or had done a year or two ago. So in the language of traders, we manage from a defensive position. Which means that things could still go wrong in unexpected ways, or that you feel confident that you have this. I mean, you live through the financial crisis. And every two weeks, somebody says, this is going to be worse than a financial crisis. This is worse than 70s. What kind of crisis are we going to see and what does it mean for the banks? First of all, I don't think, as far as the banking system goes, this will be worse than the financial crisis. I think banks are much better capitalized, but much better risk managed, and much more aware of the importance of doing that than they were back then. And the regulators are also much more intimately involved and engaged with the banks in understanding bank exposures. So I think it's not going to be like that. I think from our point of view, and speaking for Barclays, what we have to worry about is the impact on consumers. We are starting at a point where people are have strong balance sheets and employment is very high. So these are very good initial conditions. But squeezes are coming in different ways. In the UK, to a greater degree than the US, you've got the energy price squeeze. And also in the UK, to a greater degree than in the US, you've got a squeeze coming from higher interest rates and mortgage prices and rents. Because it's more of a variable rate market. It's a more of a fixed market than it used to be. But it's more variable than the US is, which has a 15 or 30-year fixed market. But you're not seeing that right in consumer spending right now. You're not seeing it in mortgages either. Is there a worry that we're complacent? And then at some point, early next year, it hits us hard. Not that we are complacent. But even though we've started off in a good condition, there are factors that are eroding that strength of the consumer balance sheet. What I'm hoping you see is people will call a soft landing and a shallow recession, helped by the initial conditions. And so what you might see is an increase in unemployment. You might see some credit weakness among customers. But it won't be so bad that you see distress instances.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,819,2022-11-19 09:39:47
18206," And so what you might see is an increase in unemployment. You might see some credit weakness among customers, but it won't be so bad that you see distress in society. However, it has to be managed carefully and it has to be managed aggressively with a balancing of the budget, and that's what the Prime Minister has said in the last couple of days. A lot of the satellites have propulsion systems. They can kind of move to get out of the way of each other. They'll change their orbit a little bit. It's a service that you guys offer to help these companies know how to maneuver their machines. Yeah, we offer a collision avoidance service. It's a subscription service. We'll send you an alert up to seven days in advance if your satellite's gonna come dangerously close to a piece of debris or another satellite. Companies have been doing that for decades moving satellites around, but it's sort of like a harder problem now. The risk of a collision is a lot higher now. Just because we've installed so much more hardware into space, you have a big collision that creates a cloud of debris, and now all the other satellites are flying through this whizzing mess of debris. As we add all of the new satellites into space, the risks of a collision, the likelihood of the collisions going up. A lot's happening on Wall Street. I'm quite in court. The center is holding. Need to catch up. This is Bloomberg Wall Street week. I'm David Weston. We've got the information and insight. A lot of these areas still have very, very good valuations. From businesses most influential and instrumental. It's knocking it out of the bolt, though. That was not a great time to be speculative. It's time for a pivot to talk on a virus significant hit to our standard of living. Bloomberg Wall Street week, live tonight with Replays All Weekend on Bloomberg Television and Radio. Talk to me a little bit about the last six weeks. So you mentioned the guilt. Was there a moment where you were in the office thinking, like, as Barclays, you're one of, of course, the players in selling in buying guilds with the margin calls coming in and saying, like, I don't know what happens in the next two hours. So first of all, I think that the volatility was managed extremely well by the very effective, targeted, and time bound actions of the Bank of England. So I think buying guilds, buying inflation linked guilds, and then the repo facility that they put in working with the banking system all helped ease the pressure in the crisis. And you've got 10-year guild heels now back below where they were at the day of the mini budget on the 23rd of September. As for us, I mean, we are large in the guilds market. What was important for us, as we saw it, was this was not a solvency issue at all for the pension system. It was a liquidity issue. And it was a liquidity issue because what was a very important feature of the UK pension system, which, by the way, I think is a good feature of the pension system, which is a matching of assets and liabilities, which employed leverage, created a liquidity problem. So a liquidity problem had to be managed. And the liquidity problem was managed by the government intervention or the Bank of England intervention, the repo facility, which allows people to borrow against assets rather than sell them and by slowly releasing the pressure. And so far, so good. Do you think that will change, actually, where you lay some surrounding pensions in the UK? So I don't know the answer, but I think what is important is that the UK pension system in aggregate is very well funded. It's about a $1,2,530% funded ratio, which is extraordinarily good, which gives it a good starting point from which to manage to a less leveraged future. It is liquidity. You're the biggest concern for banks right now. I mean, we're again hearing the US Treasury Secretary having to do things, maybe, to put a bit of extra liquidity or to pad it out in the Treasury market. Bank liquidity, I don't think, is an issue. We've had liquidity regimes. Funding models are much, much more robust than they were in the financial crisis. I think part of what people are worried about and what they saw in the guilt market was the liquidity in underlying trading, which is that these markets are not deep with smaller bid or with small bid offers in large sizes.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,820,2022-11-19 09:44:06
18207," was the liquidity in underlying trading, which is that these markets are not deep with smaller bid-offers in large sizes of trades as they used to be 15 years ago. And I think part of it, our banks are more prudent in managing their risk. So that's a good thing. It's a good thing, but it has a consequence that the big providers of liquidity have moved away from the banking system to the buy side. Do you worry about shadow banking? And is there any crossover? If you look at the system as a whole, if there's something wrong with shadow banking, does it impact the big banks? So it impacts the big banks, and by shadow banking, I'll narrow it. I'll narrow it to, let's call FinTech companies. So it impacts the banks in a good way and a bad way. So in a good way, what they've done is they've provided digital technology to the ways of giving services to customers, which customers like. And it's made us up all game. And faster than we would have otherwise. And shame on us for not having done it earlier. Now, when they go into credit, which some of them have done, they have less regulation than we do, which is perhaps not good for customers who deal with them, who may not get the protections they do if they deal with us. And perhaps not good for them if they don't lend with quite the rigor and standards that more established companies might. On the second issue, that's a supposition. Let's see. What's your relationship like with the new UK government? Have you had calls? Have you? Have they given your assurance about windfall taxes? Well, I think the government is brand new. So we obviously, many of the faces are very familiar faces, and we've been dead in communication with them in many years, and we always are with the government. And we are waiting to see their proposals on taxation, on fiscal policy, on all aspects of it. Where do you see the city of London being in four or five years? I mean, that's maybe too long a time frame. Should I say 12 months? Well, it's both too long and too short. Here we are in the city. And this city has been the center of finance for 300 years. And it needs to be the center of finance for 300 more years. We certainly would wish that that were the case. And it is the center of finance because of an excellent regulatory system, transparent, fair. It is there because of great availability of talent and infrastructure, soft financial infrastructure and hard financial infrastructure. And a part of that is also a stable, predictable taxation regime. So we hope that all those elements and ingredients remain and continue to allow the city to flourish. And the Prime Minister spoke about investing in education in Britain. And if you think about what drives the financial sector, I mean, you meet many of them. It's about the wonderfully trained people in the UK and the wonderfully trained people outside who are able to come and work in the UK. The UK has lost something. The city of London has lost business to other parts of the world in terms of financial capitals. Yes. What do you need from the government today for that to be reversed? Well, some of it is what others do. So once Brexit happened and you could not pass port financial services to London, all the major banks had to set up trading enterprises in Europe. So that is irreversible, let's say, for the time being. I think other than that, what we need is a continuation of what London has provided. Education, infrastructure, people, great regulatory regime, and a stable and predictable fiscal regime. Vika, until not too long ago, Barclays had an activist shareholder on its back. Do you think about that? You always have to think about it. I don't think about it from the point of view of our business mix. I do think we have a good business mix. And that activist shareholder came because he thought we should sell our investment bank. He could not have been more wrong. I repeat it, he could not have been more wrong. The investment bank has been what has kept Barclays flourishing and quite apart from many of our competitors in the fact that, you know, we performed extremely well.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,821,2022-11-19 09:48:23
18208," has been what has kept Barclay's flourishing and quite apart from many of our competitors in the fact that we performed extremely well during COVID, we are able to have a more diversified business model. But I think for many banks like us where our valuations are low, you know, you've always got to be worried about what is driving bank valuations. Companies now they're getting hundreds, maybe even thousands of applications. So software has come in to automate the process. You want to write your resume for robots, not for humans. The only job your resume has is to be comprehensively to the software that is reading it because that software or robot is going to decide whether or not a human forgets their eye on it. These things are programmed by a certain segment of the population that might not be totally inclusive or not be fully aware. Concerns about how this technology could exacerbate discrimination. For the FTC, I think foremost, the FTC needs to be making sure that we're fully understanding this technology. We don't trust companies to self-regulate when it comes to pollution. We don't trust them to self-regulate when it comes to workplace comp. Why on earth would we trust them to self-regulate AI? Is Europe awful banked? Europe is against separate Europe from the UK. I don't think the UK is overbanked. I think part of what drives bank valuations, especially in Europe versus the US, there is some worry about business model. I think in our case we've got the right business model and what will drive our valuation is solid performance, excellent performance, as I say, repeated excellent performance. I think in Europe, banking is still fairly nationalized, not nationalized and state-owned, but by country. I think we have to see at some point the experiment of one large European bank crossing borders in a meaningful way, and then we'll know. When do you think that will happen? Or is it just a dream? We've been talking about it. I feel like for two decades. Yeah, I mean, there's a question more for the European bank CEOs. I think it should happen. I think the test case should happen. Now is a good time. When you go through a period like this, there will be some banks which will benefit from consolidation and ownership by a larger entity. I hope I see it happen and it will be good for Europe. Your bank is doing pretty well. Others are doing less well. We talk about Credit Suisse almost day in and day out. Have you been able to get some business from clients that no longer want to bank with them? Well, business goes or every way in the banking industry. Obviously, where Credit Suisse has pulled out of certain businesses, such as the prime business, we got some business from their clients. But look, they announced a big restructuring. We wish them well. It is important for the banking system for there to be many players who are strong. I think with this restructuring, hopefully Credit Suisse is on a good upward trend and regains the prominence it used to have. Venkett, talk to me about some of the human errors, the recession that we've been talking about and how much that cost you. There was also, I don't know if it's punishments coming or a step towards the people that did those mistakes. Where are we on that? Yeah. So we had an over issuance of securities in the US. It was completely avoidable. It is one of these embarrassing moments you hate to have when you see your bank. It is, however, it was",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,822,2022-11-19 09:52:41
18209," It was completely avoidable. It is one of these embarrassing moments you hate to have when you see your for bank. It is, however, it was a human error in a very narrow way. We have done both and had an external investigation on it and internal investigation. We have made good by all the clients affected. We have had a settlement with the SEC. We cooperated from the first minute fully with all our regulators. And we dealt with the matter internally. We are in the final stages now where individuals who were affected or involved in this are being assessed. We've got a standard process by which we do that. And yes, there will be implications for certain individuals, but that process will play itself. Thank you. I mean, through your strategy, we talked a little bit about the global economy. Do you worry that this wave of inflation is just going to get worse? When will we reach peak inflation? When will we know that we've reached peak inflation? You will know that the rate of change of inflation is stabilizing when the central banks start signaling it that in their rate rises. Going away from 75 basis points, 100 basis points, to something more normal and natural. Now, mathematically, there will be some forces that will bring inflation down just because base effects as they call them. And I expect that will happen sometime in the middle of next year. Is there a danger that central banks messes up that they raise interest rates too much? Look, there's always a finely calibrated issue about when do you stop? And I think many people have raised two worries. One is that there's a supply chain led element of this. There's an energy shock element of this. Employment is at all time highs, relatively speaking. And that people have not seen such a hiking cycle in three decades. Having said that, I think the officials are all across the world are all very, very experienced. And I think they'll find the right way to calibrate it. How difficult is it in this uncertain environment, frankly, to calibrate where you want to grow businesses geographically in the world? Well, I'll speak for Barclays. We've got a real strength of the business in the US and the UK. We've got a good investment bank in Europe and a trading business. We had caught at an island, but got a large trading presence in France. And then good presence in Asia, both in the Middle East and India. We've got an excellent investment banking franchise in Singapore and Hong Kong. I expect that footprint to remain broadly as it is. We have some very interesting partnerships in Australia. We might do some others. But I expect the broad footprint to be as it is. The geopolitical complexities, which are also rising, makes people more cautious also about which countries they want to go to. Have you had to increase wages? And I'm not really thinking of the high-flyer bankers, but just to match inflation in most of these places. So we did a fairly large program of wage rises in India where we've got a large number of employees last year in 2021. In the UK, we did an interim adjustment in August of about 4% for a lot of our workers. And then we are working through another one for the end of this year. And we did one in the US also late last year. So I think inflation, especially as it affects some of our workers, we're going to have to look at it and we're going to have to respond. When you look at the return to the office, I think you, bankers, have to be back four days a week. Yeah. How's that going? It's going well. Look, I think we always have to create a balance. There's a level of flexibility that's come into work life into the workplace since COVID, which I think is good. I think some of the stigma attached to working from home has gone away. And I think that's really important, especially for those who are managing young families or have other pressures that require them to spend more time at home or close to home. And I think we should continue that and should continue that in important ways. Some jobs require you to be in the office.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,823,2022-11-19 09:57:00
18210," that require them to spend more time at home or close to home. And I think we should continue that and should continue that in important ways. Some jobs require you to be in the office. Our trading flows are largely full five days a week and that's the way it should be. Our bank branches here in London also need to be staffed and they should be. And for some other functions it can be less but I do think it's important for people in all functions at all levels to be in the office. This isn't a apprenticeship business at the end of the day and it's important to have that productivity from being face to face. When you look at the strength in dollar, this could be a shorter term. It could last for a very long time if you'll get King Dollar. What does it mean for Berkley's? Well, as a financial matter it's actually good. We have about 40% of our revenues in dollars. We've got a fairly big business in the US. More broadly though, I mean world economies will have to adjust. And that adjustment process can be painful. And you can see the pain it's inflicting in Europe and the UK. Expodes will be subsidized but import prices go up. Thank you so much. Francine, thank you very much for having me. Tag on the product may read made in the USA but the sign on the CEO's door often says made in India. AlphaBets Sundart Pichai, Microsoft Sacha Nadella, IBM's Arvind Krishna, Micron Technologies Sanjay Mayhotra and that's just the start. Added in the chief executives of Adobe, Deloitte, Gap, VMware and that doesn't count Indians running companies all over the world. Why have so many Indians risen to the top? For no coastal points to India's incredibly competitive education system, if you can survive the pressure it takes to get into one of the Indian institutes of technology, it gives you confidence to handle American universities and later the business world. Meanwhile, the belief in India's ability to produce so many tech wizards is reinforced every year. Indians make up about three force of the immigrants receiving coveted H1B visas for the US. And it's a safe bet that some of them will eventually find their way to the seasweet. No one covers the world like Bloomberg. My team thinks 2023, we avoid a recession. I'm a little more skeptical about that. China and the US both do not want to see nuclear force in the European continent.

And what does that mean? Combustion and your sketch electrified. Thank you Andy so much for coming down. It's really wonderful to have you here in person. It's my pleasure to be here. All right.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,824,2022-11-19 10:01:30
18211," Thank you Andy so much for coming down. It's really wonderful to have you here in person. It's my pleasure to be here. Thanks for having me. And I just found out we actually lived in the same dorm in college just a few years apart. So it's been almost a year since you took over from Jeff as CEO of Amazon and it's been a year of first, the first Docs Blitz since the.com boom, the first vote to unionize an Amazon warehouse, your first Bloomberg technology conference. Thank you. I want to start with a quick report card. In February 2021, Jeff Bezos shocked the world by announcing plans to step down as Amazon CEO. A few months later, he passed the reins to Andy Jassy, his longtime top lieutenant, the architect of one of the company's biggest profit engines, Amazon Web Services. Bezos has stayed on as executive chair, leaving Jassy to navigate a critical inflection point in Amazon's history. How does the company manage market turmoil, rising inflation and regulatory scrutiny, and a push by some warehouse workers to unionize all while keeping customers coming back? Joining me on this edition of Bloomberg Studio 1.0, Amazon's second CEO, Andy Jassy, he joined us from our flagship Bloomberg Technology Summit in San Francisco. I'd like you to grade your view of Amazon's performance and we've got time later to really dig in. But quickly, how would you grade Amazon's performance over the last year with customers? Well, I think I'm not sure I'm the right person to grade myself during the year or not. But I'll give you my take. I think with respect to customers, I think we've done a lot of good. And I think if you look at during the pandemic, which really has extended till the early part of this year, so much as the PPE and food and essential items and people equipping their home offices were bought from Amazon and to scale the way we needed to. Remember, in 2020, we grew 39% year over year on a $245 billion revenue run rate. It's unprecedented. It's never happened before. But it was really hard to do that. And we had to take the really big footprint of the Villamint Center footprint. We built the first 25 years of Amazon and doubled it in 24 months. We built out that transportation network in just a couple of years. We nearly doubled the size of our workforce during that time. And I think you saw it in other businesses. AWS is a really big part of helping companies and governments have business continuity during the pandemic. So many companies and organizations in the last year made the strategic decision that they were going to stop running their own infrastructure technology and disproportionately chose AWS to help them move to the cloud. And we've spent a lot of time helping them make that transformation. So what about investors? I mean, the stock is down significantly from a peak last year. Obviously, there's broader market turmoil. Yeah, I think, you know, for investors, financially, I'd say it's mixed. You know, I think we have some businesses that are growing really strongly. If you look at AWS, you know, in 2021, grew 37% year over year. It's not a $74 billion revenue run rate business. It's pretty unusual growth. And we grew 58% year over year in our advertising business, you know, it's a $32 billion revenue run rate business. So some businesses growing really strongly. And, you know, we've continued to grow in our retail business despite pretty crazy comparable during 2020. But I think the real challenge for us there is on the cost side. And there have been several things that have happened. Some of which are more controllable than others. You know, I think the part that's less controllable is really around inflation. And I think we thought that inflation would start to attenuate in 2022. And with the war in Ukraine, it just went the other way and has significantly accelerated. So the cost of trucking and line haul and ocean and air and fuel has just substantially gone up. And I think that will attenuate at some point. No one knows how long that'll take. I think the more controllable areas for us are really around fulfillment center capacity and productivity. It was taking about 24 months to build new fulfillment centers during the pandemic. And so we had to make decisions, you know, in mid-2020 early 2020.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,825,2022-11-19 10:05:44
18212," capacity and productivity. It was taking about 24 months to build new film and centers during the pandemic. And so we had to make decisions, you know, in mid-2020 and early 2021, on how much demand we were going to plant for it. And so, you know, we end up with more capacity than we need right now. And there's a number of things that we're working on. We've stopped building on properties where we don't need it yet. And we've let a number of leases lapse. And not a small number, you know, of both those things. We've had a lot of occasions in our history where we've worked on productivity, made improvements. And we have a lot of clearly defined issues. And I'm confident we're going to get back to the right level of profitability. You are going to sublyse 30 million square feet of space. Is there a mistake in the execution there because of the overbuilding? Again, because you have to make these decisions two years in advance. And again, if you put yourself back in 2020 where we were growing 39 percent year over year on a $245 billion revenue run rate, it's very hard to know what's the right amount to build. And you have to make a decision. And we made the decision to err on the side of our consumers and sellers. Now, how would you grade Amazon's performance with employees, your colleagues? There has been some high profile. Yeah, I think that when I started in this gig, we had just created a new leadership principle to strive to be Earth's best employer. And I think we're, you know, we spent a lot of time trying to think through what that really means is broad. And I think we've made a fair bit of progress, but it's still early, in my opinion. But I still think there are many areas that we can keep improving. And I think, you know, the first one I'd mention is safety. You know, I think that you know, in our fulfillment centers, that is the top priority. And you know, when you get into the details and numbers and outside of all the spin of it all, you know, we're about average there, but we're not trying to be average. You know, we want to be the best in the industry and the best in the world at it. And that's a high priority and an area that I'm passionate about and the team is passionate about. And I think we have a lot of work we can do to make our employees everyday lives easier. And we have, we've identified kind of a top 100 list of areas that we can be better at, that we're just metronomically stepping through. And so we've made a lot of progress, but we've a lot of work to you still. Elon Musk just came out saying he has a super bad feeling about the economy, Tesla laying off 10% of his staff. Jamie Dimon says he's preparing for an economic hurricane. The World Bank just slashed its forecast for global growth. How do you feel about the economic climate? Well, I wasn't planning on giving any guidance to the camera. Please. But, super bad or super bad. I think there's some things that are related to Amazon that are useful to remember. You know, I think the first piece is remember that 85% of the worldwide retail market segment share is offline. And if you believe that that equation is going to flip at some point, which we do, I think it will flip over a long period of time. If you look at different downturns, should we have one at some point? And we've been through a few, obviously, in the 25 years that I've been at Amazon, customers change their habits. And so I also think there's, you know, those two reasons, those two factors give me some optimism that even if we have a downturn, that we have the potential to still grow. We have a roadmap that's, you know, to probably three to five years long. And we're going to continue to invent. We're going to continue to be insurgent. And we have a lot of work to do to get to where we think we ultimately can get for customers. Now, when it comes to the stock, as I mentioned, it has fallen significantly. Do you think investors are missing something or has tech just been overvalued? And this also, of course, matters to employees who are significantly paid in stock? Well, you know, I look, I haven't been at Amazon for 25 years. I arrived at the company three weeks before we went public. I have never tried to predict what the stocks might do. And anytime I've tried to a little bit, I've been wrong. So, you know, I think it's a pretty hard to predict what's going to be in any short period of time. I do really believe that Benjamin Graham, Maxson, that in the short term, the stock market tends to be a voting machine and the long term it tends to be a waiting machine. And I think if you, you know, we've been through a lot of points in 25.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,826,2022-11-19 10:10:05
18213," In the short term, the stock market tends to be a voting machine, and the long term it tends to be a weighing machine. And I think if you, you know, we've been through a lot of points in 25 years at Amazon, where the macro factors are off and stocks are down. Our stock is down. But you can't really control that. You know, we have a concept we talk about a lot at Amazon inputs and outputs. You know, and the ultimate output for a company is share price. You know, and then other big outputs are free cash flow or profit or revenue. You can't really manage the outputs. You have to manage at the input level. And that's where we spend all our time. And so if you do the right things for the business long term, things tend to work out. I think we've had very good returns for investors. And I expect that to be true again. Do you see Amazon strategy as fundamentally different from Netflix and Disney and if so, how? The top names in climate change are on Bloomberg. I want everybody committed to the kind of action that we need. We have a global emergency now. You know, we're still putting 162 million tons of man-made global warming pollution into the sky every day using the sky as an open sewer. That's trapping as much extra heat as would be released by 600,000 erosion of class at Tommy Palm exploding every day. That's what the scientists tell us and the data shows it. That's crazy. That's why we have a third of Pakistan underwater. That's why we have the historic heat wave in China. Nothing comparable to that. Ever that's why the heat records are broken every year. And we're seeing an increase in the flows of climate refugees crossing international borders that are due to vastly expand unless we take action to solve the climate crisis. Nobody covers climate change like Bloomberg, your global business authority. What are the moon shots at Amazon that are capturing most of your time and attention? What is going to define the next era of Amazon? I mean, is it Astro, the home row, butter? Is it something else? Well, we have a unique way that we look at big new investments. And I'm not sure it's right or wrong. It just happens to be our way. And we ask ourselves when we're considering something for questions. We ask, if it's successful, can it be big and move the needle in Amazon? Is it being well served today? Do we have a differentiated approach? And do we have confidence there? And if not, can we acquire it quickly? And if we like the answer to those questions, we'll go pursue it with a single threaded team that isn't distracted by the rest of the business. And sometimes that leads to innovation and investments that seem pretty obvious. Like, when I got to that company, was a book's only retailer. And then we expanded to music and video electronics. And so it seems obvious to people. Other times that process does not lead to investments that seem obvious to people. I mean, AWS was something that people externally and internally thought was a little bit nutty at the time. But just imagine what Amazon would be today without AWS. And I think that you see the same thing here. There are so many significant investments from making that I'm excited about. I'm going to have to constrain myself to a few. But I'm really excited about what we're doing in the prime video space. I think we're clearly on the right track there and building a significant business. That's interesting because Netflix also just announced some layoffs. First subscriber loss in a decade. Disney cutting back on costs. Do you see Amazon strategy as fundamentally different from Netflix and Disney and it's so how? Well, we're very bullish on it. And remember, all the models are a little bit different. But for prime video, we have 200 million plus prime subscribers who get that entertainment for free by being part of prime. And so.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,827,2022-11-19 10:14:24
18214," But for Prime Video, we have 200 million plus Prime subscribers who get that entertainment for free by being part of Prime. And so we have a little bit different pricing model than some of the others. But I'm incredibly encouraged by what we have coming. If you look, I mean, we launched this show, Reacher earlier in the year, it was a huge hit. We, you know, we had the New Mazele season. We just launched the new Boys season, which is a big news. Are you a big boys fan? I am a big boys fan. It's Amazon Vot. It's very good. Of course, we have, where are the rings coming up, you know, in September, in Thursday and in a football. So I'm very bullish about it. We also, you know, we're excited about what we've done with MGM. You know, I think some of the assets there will go very well with the rest of what we're doing entertainment-wise. And so if you look at Warner Brothers Discovery and Paramount and Stars and Global, they're building really significant subscription businesses. So I'm very bullish about that business. I'm optimistic that we have a chance to build a significant grocery business, which is, you know, early stages for us. I am excited about Kuiper, which is our low-earth orbit satellite that we're building. You've got to remember there are 300 to 400 million people in the world who have limited to no internet connectivity. I mean, just think about how different the world is when you don't have that type of connectivity. And so I think that's a really significant opportunity that has some AWS characteristics to it. I continue to be very optimistic about Alexa, you know, building the world's best personal assistant. We have, you know, 200 million endpoints already that are using Alexa. We're clearly on to something there. And then, you know, our autonomous driving, ride hailing service and zoos that we're building, you know, here in the Bay Area. I just think with the way auto consumption is evolving, I think that also is a chance to be really significant business. I don't know if all of them are going to be successful, but if any one of them becomes the fourth pillar for us on top of marketplace and prime and AWS, we're a completely different company, just like we were when AWS became successful. So I think they're very worthwhile investments and bets and I'm optimistic about them. You didn't mention Astro, obviously, though, powered by Alexa. You mentioned Astro, yeah. But I mean, our home robot's going to be doing where I don't yet. Where is it? It's not really widely available for sale. What's the status? I hope you get one. Thank you. Everyone's very curious about Jeff's role these days. What kind of executive chair he really is. He said when he left that he'd focus his attention and energies on initiatives that he really cares about as at Amazon, but from the outside, it looks like he's really focusing on philanthropy, he's focusing on space. What kind of an executive chairmen is he? Well, Jeff is always going to be involved and he has, you know, I feel very lucky to have been in Amazon for 25 years. I feel very lucky to have worked directly for Jeff for 20 of them. And we have a really close relationship and have for a long time. And I think we share a lot of the same values about customers and how important it is to optimize for customers and how high standards they need to be, you know, given how easy it is for people to switch and the importance of invention and speed. And so, you know, I just feel very lucky to have had the chance to work so closely with them. Is your relationship, I mean, he was your only boss for 25 years, right? Is your relationship fundamentally different than it was when you were the head of your career? Yeah, of course, you know, every single job you have, the relationships different. You know, remember, the first couple years I worked for Jeff, I worked as what we call his shadow then, which is really like a chief of staff. And that was different than when I was starting AWS, which was different from when we got AWS going and it was, you know, a business that was starting to do well. And it's different when I'm in the CEO role. But, you know, the constant has always been that we have a great relationship and we collaborate really well. Amazon is poised to become the biggest private sector employer in the world. Second, only right now Walmart is in that spot. But Amazon will probably soon surpass it. First vote to unionize at an Amazon warehouse. I know you've been spending a lot of time at warehouses. When you look at someone like Chris Mals, who I think some people look at as this modern day hero who got fired, pulled off this union vote, what's your message to someone like him? Your message to the folks who think maybe we should join a union? Well, I know. I know.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,828,2022-11-19 10:18:47
18215," pulled off this union vote. What's your message to someone like him? Your message to the folks who think maybe we should join a union? Well, I think that the first thing to be clear about is that employees get to make that choice, whether they want to have a union or not. They always have had that choice and it continues to be their choice. And we happen to think they're better off without a union for a number of reasons, including the fact that it's much harder when you have a union to have a direct relationship with your manager and to get things done quickly. So if you see something on the line that you think could be better for your team or you or your customers, you can't just go to your manager and say, let's change this. There's a whole process in bureaucracy that you have to go through to be able to do that. And when there's a union, we're going to get the feedback filtered by what the union decides is worth bringing up. And we'd much rather hear from every employee whatever is on their mind. And so I think if you want to continue to have the structure that we've had for all this time, you have to have really competitive benefits. And then I think if you look at Amazon's, they're very unusual in this space. We championed the $15 minimum wage several years ago. The starting salary is now over $18 an hour, which is more than double the federal minimum wage. You get full health insurance and 401K and up to 20 weeks of parental leave. And if you want to get a college education, you haven't had one. We have a career choice program that lets our fulfillment center associate be able to do so. That is a very unusual and compelling set of benefits. And those were all accomplished without a union. So I think that we realize that we have to continue to work on the relationship with our employees and we need to continue to provide the right benefits. And we need to continue to work on safety and that's our intention. You made a huge mark on Amazon with AWS obviously. What is the mark that you want to make still?

The FTC has revamped its antitrust inquiry into Amazon and by some accounts is accelerating it. Are you preparing for an antitrust lawsuit from the FTC? If you are a large company that's growing to a significant extent like we have, you have to be prepared to be scrutinized and we have known this for some time, you know, many years and we have tried to run the company with that in mind and knowing that if somebody looked that we would stand up to that scrutiny and I think that's what we've tried to do in running the business. We can't control whether organizations spring different suits against us but I think if you look at our business, if you actually look at the fact, if you take out of the equation that there may not be the most objective leadership when it comes to Amazon in that organization, if you look at the facts in our retail business, we're about 1% of the worldwide retail market.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,829,2022-11-19 10:23:02
18216," when it comes to Amazon and that organization, if you look at the facts in our retail business, we're about 1% of the worldwide retail market segment share. And remember, 85% of it is still offline. And if you look in our AWS business, we, depending on you measure it, 95% of the worldwide global IT spend is on premises. And then we have a cloud business, and then we have a portion of that. We're leading market segment share in the cloud part of this, but we operate, you know, who we compete with, AWS is really on premises, IT, in addition to the cloud. So, you know, these are relatively small percentages of the entire pie, and you can kind of step through all the businesses. And I think simply because you've been successful in a few different businesses, doesn't somehow mean that you have a natural market power. It just means you've been successful on a couple different customer experiences, but we still have a relatively small amount of market segment share in those areas. What about the SEC, you're being sued by them over third party data and how you've used it. Do you think in the past Amazon main mistakes with letting employees internally see how those third party sellers were doing? We have pretty good control. I mean, you know, we of course disagree with the premise of that. But I would say that we have very good controls with respect to the data that different employees sets are able to see. And by the way, I think that we can be better for sellers. You know, I think that, you know, we can have better tools from the get started. We can have better tools from the manage what they're doing across their different Amazon units. I think we can communicate better. There's a whole bunch of things we can do better. And we agonize over every single email or communication we get from sellers, and we do very regularly robust surveying. And a lot more sellers are happy with Amazon than unhappy with Amazon. And I think if you look at what they're able to do is, you know, as a business by virtue of selling on Amazon versus not, it completely changes what's possible. Sellers don't really long for e-commerce software. That exists in lots of places. And it's not very expensive. What they love about selling on Amazon is that they get access to our hundreds and millions of customers. And that completely changes what their prospects can be in terms of the businesses they're building. So we have a lot of work to do there. Like we do in a lot of other places. But I think we have a very strong partnership with sellers. What's the view of the supply chain right now? And how much pain there is going to continue to be and for how long? Well, you know, I think that there's a lot of challenges in the supply chain still. I mean, it's gotten better than it was. But there are all sorts of challenges. Non-parasable goods, electronics, chips, it's still a really significant issue for all sorts of businesses. We have worked really hard to open a lot more points of presence and ports and increase our capacity and getting products in. But I think it's going to be something that companies battle with for some time. You made a huge mark on Amazon with AWS, obviously. What is the mark that you want to make still on Amazon? I mean, in this new role, what's going to define the Andy Jassy era? Well, I don't really think of it that way, Emily. I mean, I don't think it's really about any Andy Jassy era or any one person. And by the way, AWS was not about any one person. If you spend a time on AWS, that is an unbelievable team, not just an incredible leadership team, which it is, but just top to bottom, the number of inventors and people care about customers and operate something where it has to work almost like a doubt. It's always teams. And so I look at every single one of our businesses and take our retail business or our consumer business, which is the oldest for our businesses, 85% of it still lives offline. I think we have a lot of upside and a lot of growth. And I think as much invention as we've seen the last 25 years, the time I've been there, I think it's going to look small compared to the next 25 years. There is a lot for us to invent on behalf of customers. And so I'm excited to be part of the team that makes it happen.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,830,2022-11-19 10:27:22
18217," And there, I think it's going to look small compared to the next 25 years. There is a lot for us to invent on behalf of customers. And so, you know, I'm excited to be part of the team that makes that happen. You know, we are continuing to, you know, to increase the amount that we give back to the communities in which we have a big presence. And that really matters to me. I think we have a responsibility to do that. And so, you know, it's a long journey that we're working on. But I'm excited to be part of it. And, you know, I hope you're doing it for a long time. Well, thank you for joining us and telling us about the way the journey is going so far. Thank you very much. And, you know, thank you. and thank you. Stalked early enough all these precious materials you were just mentioning and we were on the lucky side that our prognosis was spot on in a way forecasting what kind of material we would need and what quantity we would need. For something as universally important to human life as sleep, mysteries surrounding its necessity and utility have only just been recently uncovered. Some of our biggest discoveries were in the 1970s or 1980s and so it makes that a really exciting field because it seems as though we're uncovering new insights each and every day. Some scientists are going further to find out how sleep and what happens there can be harness to further expand our understanding. It's easy to memorize things that makes you smart if you can spit back a lot of facts, but if you want to be wise, if you really want wisdom, you got to know when and how and why to use that information and that's what you bring figures out while you're sleeping. Thank you for having me. What drives you? What drives me? Oh my God. I love the idea of just...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,831,2022-11-19 10:31:53
18218," We were swimming pool. Thank you so much for joining us. Thank you for having me. What drives you? What drives me? Oh my God, I love the idea of just a simple as this uninclusive world. A world where people see themselves reflected. Because I was supposed to be invisible by your accounts. I was supposed to not be where I am. I was supposed to have disappeared a long time ago. And every turn in my life was about visibility. Yes, I will be this person who's not supposed to be here. Yes, I will fight through the hard times. Yes, I won't give up. And even though I was sort of the token black editor in the industry in the 90s, I knew even then that I needed to bring people up with me. I needed to bring other people up with me. And so that's really been a part of, you know, maybe it's maybe it was growing up in a family of six. I don't know. But when you run a team, how do you instill that work ethic that kind of answering emails at all time? Yeah, I mean, you know, I think you can say an example. You know, if you're an editor who leaves and has lunches and it's never in the office, you know, you don't really sort of instill faith. My team know that, you know, we're on a mission. We have to reflect the world we live in. We have to reflect, you know, the beauty of multiculturalism. We have to reflect, you know, the beauty and diversity. And inclusivity. So everybody takes it really seriously. And we really have intense conversations about the side guys and the world. And so I'm very lucky to have a team who are as passionate. And you know, I could call my team, you know, I could call somebody at six a.m. or they can call me at six a.m. and I'll pick up and they'll pick up. So, you know, we have something very special that we've built over the past sort of five years. But there were difficult moments, right? I think the first time one of your first issues, you thought that you could have been fired for it. Is that, right? I mean, I lived in America for a bit and I was working for W Magazine. And there was talk of Brexit. And of course, Americans were like, your country's really, you know, xenophobic. So, you know, I came back and I thought, you know, I'm going to be welcome with open arms and they're going to love me and oh my god, literally back to them by fire. But I remember thinking, you know, I wanted to create a magazine where every woman could see themselves, you know, where every woman, regardless of the backgrounds, regardless of their age, could just literally see themselves. And at the time, now it looks like it's the norm when you look at other magazines. But in 2017, that was, that was a radical idea. But I also remember thinking, you know, with my background, you know, I've lost so much and gained so much that I thought, if I knew, if I'm fired, I'd rather be fired for what I believed in. I'd rather be fired for creating a magazine that reflected the world as it was than try to sort of create a second-rate version of someone's vision. And that continues. I mean, there's this idea of always pushing forward. Yeah. Right? What's the end? How do you measure success? How do I measure success? I'm definitely not financial. I mean, I think it's more about, for me, when I'm really exhausted, when I'm really tired, when I'm really questioning if I can go on, you know, I walk on the street and I see a little girl, a little black girl who's seen the magazine and it's the norm for them or a curvy woman on a traitor Paris who's like, thank you for, you know, seeing me, you know, that makes it worth it. Like that for me is success. And anybody who knows or has known me for a while will witness that that for me is success. You know, my jaw is done when that happens. Do you think, I mean, do people come up to you? They do, but it's always in a positive way. It's always thank you for seeing us, you know. But I can relate, because like, as I said to you know, by all accounts, I was meant to be invisible, you know. So for me, shining in light on people and making them seen, it's natural for me. They say that the fashion industry is changing. You're changing it. Are others around you changing it? I mean, now, you know, you look at other magazines and seeing real women in there, it's no longer a radical act, seeing, you know, people of color, women of color.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,832,2022-11-19 10:36:05
18219," Look at other magazines and seeing real women in there, it's no longer a radical act. Seem, you know, people of color, women of color on covers is no longer a radical act. So it's been normalized. And for me, I'm quite happy when I see that. You know, when you put Dame Judy Dench on the cover, and she's 85 years old, and the world just laughed it. Nobody questioned her, you know, should she be on the cover or you put, you know, a girl with a hijab on the cover, and it's not a problem. That for me shows that, you know, we're advancing. We're progressing. So, you know, progress for me is very important. Which is important. And so how do you take care of your team? How do you build the team around you? My team, I mean, you know, somebody said to me once, when you build a team, make sure you employ people you like. People, when you see them working towards your office, you're just so excited to see. That was it. Being good at your job and sort of a connection. And being excited to see, you know, team members, because you only have to be good as your team, you know. No man is an island. You know, I don't create the magazine on my own. And so it's great to have a team who, you respect and who's views you respect, you know, and who respect you. How do you think you're seen by your team? Do you have to be fearful? Do you have to be also terrible? I don't care. I'm a worker. I work very hard. But I think I'm pretty open. You can have conversations with me. You know, ultimately the final decision rests with me. But I do listen. I like conversation. I like interaction. And so that's, I mean, that's how I hope they think I'm a good boss. And that's, you know, really all you can hope for. Because, you know, they work on a very good magazine. They can get other jobs anywhere. So the fact that they're there makes me think that they must be happy. Edward, how do you see the publishing world changing? So people buy less magazines. You've been, I mean, you've been doing pretty well in terms of selling more. But in five years, how does it look? How does it look? I mean, I was like, you know, five years ago, I, you know, even, I mean, let's go back to ID when I was 18, you know, I heard it to the magazine, you know, which will come out. We're all about club kids and you have to be out there. And the only way you can see street fashion was through ID. And then 2017, I inherited, you know, I inherited a magazine. But now I oversee a brand, you know, the magazine is so, the magazine is sort of the highest or the high, the best paper, you know, the best photographers, the best, you know, cultural messages. But at the moment, you know, when you manage a brand, it's not just about that. It's about digital. It's about video. It's about audio. It's about events. So for somebody who's so forward looking, it's so great for me. And people always ask, oh, it's a magazine's dead. When we launch a cover, Instagram, it's our cover, essentially. So I've, you know, found a way, we found a way of sort of making it work hand in hand. And it's so great for me, you know, I think, how do I just been doing the magazine? I probably would have been bored. Yeah. So magazines aren't dead. Are they going to go down? No, I mean, yeah, but they're going to work in hand with digital platforms, you know. But also, I'll tell you something, new readers of old, young readers don't necessarily come to us through the new stands. They come through that, you know, digital platforms or, you know, audio or videos we put out. So, yes, now it's increased tenfold. So, yeah. Well, do you think that will change the kind of readership that you will court, the either age of your readers, but also where they come from? Yes, I mean, at the moment, you know, I think the readership is getting younger because of, you know, the whole digital landscape. And I hope that, you know, as we move forward, it kind of, yeah, we have new readers and we also keep our loyal readers, you know. Edward, do you think there's ever a time where actually we won't have print magazines anymore? No, I think print will always exist, sort of, at lunchtime digital, but it'll probably be something more precious, sort of better paper, something more collectible that you want to keep in your house, almost like artwork. So, no, I don't think print is going to die. So, fewer copies. See you a copy. But more people. More people. More people. Better quality, you know, like a book. Almost like a book. The cable book. There you go. What's a person? We'll talk with him now.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,833,2022-11-19 10:40:35
18220," No, I don't think Prince is going to die. So, so, so, fewer copies. See a copy. But more people. More, better quality. You know, almost like a book. The table book. I love that. I know. Needs it. It is crucially important. And I think we've moved from this attitude, from its indulgence, a waste of time, almost an illness that needs a cure. For something as universally important to human life, as sleep. Mysteries surrounding its necessity and utility have only just been recently uncovered. Some of our biggest discoveries were in the 1970s or 1980s. And so it makes that a really exciting field, because it seems as though we're uncovering new insights each and every day. Some scientists are going further to find out how sleep and what happens there can be harnessed to further expand our understanding. It's easy to memorize. That makes you smart. If you can spit back a lot of facts. But if you want to be wise, you really want to listen. You've got to know when and how and why to use that information.

It got a little spooked by the idea that geocletal potential rises. You're recently on TikTok. Yes. Is that fun? Well, I'm so much fun. I literally have to be held back. But the brilliant thing is, I'm so curious. I mean, I like all the digital platforms. I really like to keep my finger on the poles. I'm not one of those people that leaves work and just shuts themselves in. I really want to be out there seeing the world as today. In all his beauty. So I'm very curious. I have a very curious mind. And I'm glad. I'm glad. It keeps everything moving and exciting. So is that for Gen Z? Is that a commercial purpose to get also get closer? No, it's just out of curiosity. I've always been like that. I've always wanted to know what's next. I didn't want to be the one that's just being told, oh, you're 50 or whatever. I pay attention to everything. But there was such a beautiful place for me. And it goes back to my childhood again. Well, the biggest challenge to grow the brand in the next five years. Because we still keep it relevant. We have such great digital traffic. Almost almost 6 million every month to Britishville. But I'm really sort of excited about overseeing the European vows as well, Spain, Italy, Germany, and France. And sort of mentoring a whole new generation of editors. When there was this whole agonization, the whole world thought there was a global view that was going to dominate. But it's very much about local conversations, as well as global conversations. So I learn from these content leads. And I hope that they also learn. So the local global conversation, I'm very excited about moving into the future. Do you think it changes if we're in a recessionary environment? So you have such a glamorous lifestyle. Or what you sell is so glamorous. Is it impacted by the cost of living or inflation of what we can live through? I mean, you know, I remember a few years ago, I put Taylor Swift on the cover. And the pipeline was better by.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,834,2022-11-19 10:44:42
18221," You can live through? I mean, you know, I remember a few years ago I put Taylor Swift on the cover and the bioline was by better, by less. And it was a radical concept at the time. But now we all talk about sustainability. We know we can't keep shopping every day. We know we have to buy things that last, things that help the planet, things that we can pass on to sort of other generations. So I think that really is a conversation on the fashion industry that's having right now that I find so exciting. And it's going to be sort of, you know, people are going to have less money so they have to buy things that last. And I'm really excited. And these are real changes. It's not just real changes. Real changes. Real changes, it's not just conversation, it's actually happening. Do you think fashion brands always need to have a political point of view when they're great injustices? I think fashion brands can do more. I feel that having a black model in your show or having a feed on your Instagram post, it's not enough. We need diverse voices behind the scenes. I always say that I talk to sort of all the CEOs I know we need to employ more people from, you know, from diverse backgrounds because that's the only way you can even reach out to more people, you know. A variety of voices always better than just one. And I always also say, you know, let's not just have interns, let's have people on all different levels. And that's what I keep talking to people about. Do they listen? Some listen. But I think since, you know, George Floyd was murdered more and more companies sort of made pledges to people of color. And you know, it's a slow process, some have taken it seriously and some are still working their way through it. But you know, you have to keep on. The problem is that you can make a pledge and then follow through. Right? I know. So you have to really sort of focus and keep asking that question for people to follow through. And so do you feel like you're a guardian of, also of that, of making sure that when you get promised something, they'll do it and you'll hold them into account? Yes, if they promise something, you know, that I asked for, then I will literally wear you down. I'll literally chase you until you keep your promise, that's just who I am. We actually have one of the diverse cabinets here in the UK with Liz Truss. Is that important to you? It is so important as somebody who came from another country and was sort of welcomed by the UK. It's very important to have a diverse cabinet. That's how change happens. You know, going back to what we discussed before. That's how you understand people who are on the periphery or who've been adverts. It's so important to have a diverse cabinet. But this you think in terms of policies and what they can bring to the table or just also seeing how they can have an effect on policy. I hope they can have an effect on the parties themselves as well as policy. For me it's about policy that makes people's lives better. I know you're also very close to Ghana still. I mean there's a pretty scandalous anti-LGBT bill getting through. I mean, you know, it's so funny. I was invited back to Ghana a few years ago by the president was the year of the return. And I remember the last time we were in Ghana we were fleeing. And I really supported the changes. I love the changes that we're going through. But yes, they do have an LGBT problem. Some friends and I signed a whole, I don't know if you saw it. And we're doing what we can to change things on the ground. And I think you can't also sit in the West and tell a country what to do. So it's about sort of forming alliances on the ground and seeing what is needed and how we can help. Rather than standing on our soap boxes going, do that, do that. So that's through what grounds, I mean ground work trying to change from with it. Yes, from with it. Trying to change from with it and you know, talking to heads of LGBTQ LGBT kids.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,835,2022-11-19 10:49:00
18222," I mean, groundwork, trying to change from within or... Yes, from within. Yeah. Trying to change from within, you know, talking to heads of LGBTQ members and asking them what they need and what we can do to help. Rather than, you know, I say, do this. This is how you do it, because we don't live there. You have a memoir out. Yeah. Why put it down on paper? You know, something about when you turn 50. You know, something about when it's your fifth year at Vogue. You know, I got married this year. You know, I'm normally not someone who looks back all the time, but it felt like the right time for me to do that. And also, you know, I just felt that a lot of young people sort of see people like you and I and they think, you know, we just got here. We were always here and for me was really important to share the story of a journey about, you know, successors and, you know, failures and, you know, that's the reason why I got here. So I just wanted to share that story with them. Sort of young people. That's what those people who, you know, feel like they're on the outskirts of, you know, the outside of the industry, really. Do you feel like an outsider? I think I'll always feel like an outsider, but as I said before, you know, I grew up African in an African household in England. You know, different languages, different foods, and I'll go to school and I've been in England. So I've always been about duality. I've always seen myself as an outsider, I was an insider. And even when, you know, I took the job at British Folk, I was the black gay working class outsider, but, you know, I've been in the industry since I was 18. So I was, in essence, an insider. So that's really, it's the other duality that plays out in my life. What, who do you think made you the person you are today? I know you left home twice, right, Ghana, but also you had to leave your home. Yes. I mean, the puzzle made me, who I mean, really is my mother. I mean, I mean, I loved my mother. She taught me about sort of beauty. She taught me about clothes, about fascist. She also taught me that beauty came in all forms, that, you know, women were beautiful, no matter what shaped they were, what color, what religion. And so that really stayed with me. And, I guess my creativity comes from her. And of course, I also had a military father. So the idea of precision and organization and sort of thinking ahead also comes from here. So the best of both worlds. How did your father, I know you had a difficult relation with your father. How did your father shape the person you are today? It's so funny. I should ask this question because I never thought I was like my father. Growing up, you know, I was very shy, very sensitive, you know, a little spacey. I prefer the company of women. To men, my dad was sort of, you know, a sort of a theory and disciplinarian. You know, you had to, you know, be home at a certain time. You know, he grew up as an Iron Fist. And I thought, you know, I'm never going to be like him. You know, he kicked me out of the house, you know, when I was 18. And, but I found out that over the years when it comes to work and discipline and sort of organization, that is him to a T. You will put a woman on Mars. You will bring forth global cooling. You will be the first Chief Crypto Officer. Because when you subscribe to Bloomberg, you won't just get news. You'll get insight into limitless possibilities, knowledge and inspiration to feed your ambition. So before you invent pioneer, disrupt, before you change the world, Bloomberg. Why do the biggest names in business choose Bloomberg? That's a great question. Press question I get all night.

18223," James and business choose Bloomberg. I have to do great questions. Great question. Great question. Pest question I get all night. Bloomberg Top Experts Great Questions. So at some point you lose your eyesight. What was that like? Yeah. Basically, I have sort of very high myopia. So I've never had great eyesight and I went through a series of sort of retinal detachment that's for to be exact. And with each detachment I'll sort of have to end up looking down in a contraption for about three weeks. And in the dark room, it was very harrowing. It's very harrowing time in my life. But I always say, you don't have to have vision to have vision. So in those dark rooms my imagination was even bigger. You know, I dream bigger. And I came out of sort of the last surgery and the cover I did was for W Magazine with Rihanna, the Queen, with a golden eye. And I look back at the end and I thought, oh my god, there are the eyes, some limit, some limitily. So yes, it was very challenging. And even to this day, you know, I go for checkups to make sure my eyes are okay. And they're great right now. And you know, the more I look after myself, the better. The better I'll get. But it's amazing, you power through adversity. Do you ever think actually this is too much? Have you ever thought this is too much? I mean, there have been times when I felt this is too much, but it's not in my vocabulary to start. It's not in my DNA to start. You know, I am my mother's son, my father's son, you know, the edge to move forward, it's always there. And that's why, you know, when I was young, I would always get up and work. I had a recording attachment. I still got on a plane to go shoot the Hollywood portfolio. But now I'm learning to say no. Now I'm learning I can't do that job. I can't fly. No. It takes time, but it comes with age. It takes courage to say no, right? Definitely. So when you look at all your covers and there's so many beautiful ones, is there one that's special to you? Well, I say to someone, they're like my children. You always have a different child. I'm especially proud of the covers we did in lockdown, you know. When the world had essentially shut down, you know, the teams were sort of scattered all around London. And I had to go back to the days of I.D. when, you know, you had to really create user imagination. And we had a series of four covers, Judy Dinch, when they said, you know, anybody over 60 should stay at home. The essential workers cover. A cover of landscapes, just so people could take a breather. And the activists cover when George Floyd was murdered. And I really think we create covers that, you know, in years time people can look back and see what the time, that period was like for me, an artist always has to reflect the times, as Nina, to paraphrase Nina Simone, and that's really important for me. I mean, there was a bit of controversy with Linda van Gelista. Yes. I mean, you know, there was a, there was a complaint that, oh, you know, she should, she should have looked a certain way, you know. And for me, I've known Linda in the 90s. I've known this incredible icon who really defined what a model should be. And I also saw my friend go through really dark days, you know, due to the complications for surgery, literally disappear from the world, really not the Linda the world news. So when we were doing this cover, it was the collaboration.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,837,2022-11-19 10:57:44
18224," It should disappear from the world, really not the Linda the world news. So when we were doing this cover, it was the collaboration. She wanted to be that Linda that everybody knew. She wanted to feel good about herself again, and I wasn't going to deny her that act. And also, you know, whatever I would like to say, whatever a woman wants to do with her body, it's up to her. So, you know, I'm very proud of Linda and I'm very proud of that cover. I mean, sometimes you're almost like an activist. Is that how you're like a fashion activist or a political fashion? I'm a bit of a actor with soul, but I'm definitely creative. But, you know, I've always believed, you know, look at my life story in my book, you know. I wasn't like I kept saying I wasn't supposed to be here. You know, have my dad not left? I don't know, even what would have happened to my family. So even when we ended up in a room, two rooms in a voxel, six of us, we were so happy to be there, penniless, but so happy to be there. So, you know, every day, I just, you know, I'm an optimist. And I know it's not the most fashionable thing, but that's why I'm sitting here with you today. Bye. Edward, thank you so much for your time today. Thank you. So, is there more pressure when you're trying to win a basketball championship than when you're trying to please investors? Where's the greater pressure? Oh, I think it's definitely trying to win a championship. It's hard because a lot of, like when you invest and you know this, when you're investing, you can control a lot more things. When, you know, in a basketball court, you can't control whether somebody's going to make a shot, you've got to get lucky. And what's the greater pleasure of making five times your money on a distressed debt investment or winning the NBA championship? They're both fabulous. I wish I could do one each year. That would be great. But I think there's a great feeling in being right on an investment, that you've done a tremendous amount of work and you've made money for your clients, which I think is great. I think winning a championship is, it's a very surreal feeling because there's a whole city or state that is actually behind you. You know, we had 70,000 people at the finals and we had them all outside. And it's 17,000 in stands. And then literally like 60,000 people outside. And when we won, like just the joy that you had brought to the city was phenomenal. We will never break. We will never break. Build on a foundation strong enough to stay. We will never break. Have a wide array of zips and the mountains shake. All our will remain. We will never. No, no, we will never. No. You luxuryid creatures. can be done about it. It was a week of hoping. That thing is just white.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,838,2022-11-19 11:02:01
18225," It was a week of hoping, hoping that things just might start to move in a better direction in U.S.-China relations after a President Biden's meeting in Bali with President Xi. I absolutely believe there's need not be a new Cold War. I do not think there's any imminent attempt on the part of China to invade Taiwan. And I made it clear that our policy in Taiwan has not changed at all. Hoping that inflation may just be easing a bit in the United States with Fed Vice Chair Leo Brainer telling Bloomberg, we might see a bit of moderation in rate hikes. I think it will probably be appropriate to move to a slower pace of increases, but I think it's really important to emphasize. We've done a lot, but we have additional work to do both on raising rates and sustaining restraint to bring inflation down. Hoping that the new British government has gotten the message as it put forth a new budget designed to reassure the markets. So today we deliver a plan to tackle the cost of living crisis and rebuild our economy. Our priorities are stability, growth, and public services. And then of course, there's that special kind of hope that former President Trump brings to everything he does, deciding that despite what happened in the midterms to his hand-picked candidates, this was the right time to announce he's running again for President. In order to make America great and glorious again, I am tonight announcing my candidacy for President of the United States. Even as prominent investor and Republican supporter Ken Griffin of Citadel couldn't find much to hope for, and Mr. Trump's candidacy. He lost in 2020. We lost Georgia because of his behavior in the Senate race in 2020. That's the second loss. And then this year, the Republicans lost the Senate because the Trump-back candidates in the Senate races were rejected by American voters. That's a three-time loser. And I'd like to think that the Republican party's ready to move on from somebody who's been for this party a three-time loser. But whatever we were all hoping for this week, we didn't really get that much out of the market, which traded without real conviction, with the S&P 500 off just 7 tens of a percent of the week, and the Nasdaq down 1.57 percent, and the yield on the 10 year up about seven basis points in the week at 3.82. To help us sort it all out, we welcome now a sunny, best-less CEO of Rock Creek and Bob Michael, his chief investment officer and head of the Global Fixed Income Unit at JPM We're going to asset management. So welcome both of you. Great to have you back. Bob, let me start with you. I mean, I watched the Econ numbers. I listened to the Fed speak. I sort of felt like I was going both ways at the same time. What did you see? Well, for a bond investor, all of us who have been battered this year, this is one of the weeks that made sense to us. We had a nice tailwind coming in from the inflation data. It was great all the way through core when you look at shelter everything. Yes, the markets went a little crazy. They went wild, and the central bankers did what they're supposed to do. They came in one by one and reminded us, don't declare victory yet. These are only a couple of prints. There are more hikes to come, but maybe there is some optimism. And the market settled down. So I look at this week, and I thought, this is the first great week in a long time. So I've said the way you saw it as well, and there's still some more hikes to come. How many? I think at least another three to start with, 50 basis points next time in December, followed by at least two or three 25 basis points next year. And then we'll see from there. And I think what Bob said is very true at the same time as we were listening to at least three Fed people come and speak. I wrote down, I think they all had very different codes. And you had some of that when Leiborne talked, but you also had the president of St. Louis Fed say something slightly different as if we would start continue with rate increases for one longer than she had implied. And then of course, we had Susan Collins come in today with even potential 75 basis points. So we place it below.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,839,2022-11-19 11:06:27
18226," For a while longer than she had implied, and then of course we had Susan Collins come in today with even you know sort of potential 75 basis points. So we're hearing numbers that are a little bit all over the place and trying to make sense of it. So Bob, are the markets making it harder for the Fed as a practical matter? They were at the start of the week. I think not so much now. I think we're all in the same spot. We've all got realistic expectations. The Fed's headed to 4.5%, 5%. They'll get there sometime in the first quarter. We'll see where inflation is if it's below the Fed funds rate. Then that gives them some scope to pause on the tightening. We can reevaluate at that point. But right now, bond yields have gone up a long way in a very short period of time. It's time for a breath. Bob, does that get us to a soft landing? Unfortunately, it does not. And I think that's the one consistent message from the Fed. Susan Collins aside, which is there is going to be pain for businesses and households. When you have this magnitude of rate hikes in such a short period and you're also withdrawing liquidity through quantitative tightening, it's going to bite. And we're already seeing it's biting the economy hard. Thankfully, it's also now starting to bite inflation. So I want to pick up on the liquidity just for a moment if I could have Sonia. How big a problem do we have in the Treasury market now with the liquidity? I hear conflicting things, but some people are very concerned about it. Big problems. I think Bob lives it much more than I do. But as you know, they're very, very big problems with the trading volumes. And for big traders or even small traders getting a bit is becoming much harder and you're working in a much less liquid liquid environment. And I know between Treasury and the banks, there have been a lot of meetings, but I'm not so sure if we have a solution yet. Bob, could the Fed make it easier with some regulatory changes? It could, but I think the moaning that we hear in the bond market about liquidity, it's always there. We always complain we don't get the price we want. The reality is for the last couple of weeks, you could have moved your portfolio in any direction you wanted up and down duration, up and down credit risk without any kind of penalty. So I'm not that big a believer in the lack of liquidity. So, I think when we talk about a soft landing, it brings me back to oil because oil did move this week and it moved down in the price of oil. And most people I talked to suggested it was in part because of a concern about global recession, really a backing offer, at least a softening in the markets. You came out of that business. You really know energy backwards and forwards. What are we seeing in oil? We said oil prices did the future numbers went down below 80, which was a big shift from a little while ago, but my view is still that we might just avoid a recession in the US if we're fortunate. But we may not be able to avoid it in Europe and the rest of the world. And a lot of the, I think, softness for these numbers that we saw today and in recent days is because of the expectations in China. Now, China is starting to open up a little bit maybe and loosen its COVID rules, but that's going to take a while. And I think that's softening is softening the oil markets and will probably continue to do that. Is it opening up? I mean, I'm not exactly sure exactly what's happening because on the one hand, we hear them saying things that sound a little softer on zero COVID and the other hand, we hear about a lot of cases. So it is, it was kind of interesting. We had a team out in Asia this week and they came back with interesting news that there is actually some physical opening up. But now you have people who are afraid to go out because they've been told so long that they're if they go out, they'll get COVID. So you sing a very different phenomenon, which is actual, you know, individuals not wanting to go out of their houses versus the government, which has been very strict about you're getting out of your house. I'm sorry, I was at the G20, of course, meeting with Mabali and some people thought there would be no single statement coming out of it. They did come to some agreement in part driven by some of the developing countries. Should that be encouraging to investors actually that we're getting back perhaps a little toward multilateral cooperation? Much more positive news came out of the G20 than we all expected. And as you said, there was also a lot of big.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,840,2022-11-19 11:10:39
18227,"儿 The Hydrogen has a very special place in the universe. It is the first element on the periodic table. It is the most abandoned element in the universe. And when clean energy advocates think about what can we find which would be as easy to use as fossil fuels they think about hydrogen. The fuel that will when burn only produce water. We like to imagine that if we just built enough of these and these we could ditch fossil fuels and save the planet. Unfortunately it's not that simple. There are some things where you just need a good old-fashioned combustible fuel. Now startups around the world are betting that hydrogen can become the fuel of the 21st century.

I think it's driven companies like Cisco given the life they have had. It's also spectacularly volatile. The market is pulled back in this sector since it began in 1995. It's pulled back 30-50% at least seven or eight times. That was Henry Blodget talking about the internet and tech on Wall Street way back in June of 2000 when the number one movie in the country was Mission Impossible 2. And the most popular song in the country was Maria Maria by Santana. I'm the top Michael of GPMorgan and of Sonny Beschelts of Rod Creek. Sonny certainly Mr Blodget was right that we gave us an awfully big and successful company. No question about it. Some people thought that would happen as well in the crypto space. This week we're not quite as sure after FTX. What do we make of that? Does that have broader significance in the markets or is it just a one off? Hopefully it is more limited. I think there is no question that with that regulation, and we've all been talking about having this sector regulated, it would help. It's the market itself, but also the investors going in. Having this particular, you know, FTX, which is an exchange core crypto, be based in the Bahamas with not just no regulation, but also with a few people who have very limited experience in finance or in anything, really, run it. I think the shocking part of it, David, was that very, very sophisticated venture firms from Sequoia and others who were invested. It was not just retail getting involved in that market. So it was a surprise, but hopefully it will get limited. And I think it has put a lot of pressure on increasing regulation sooner here. And that will be a good thing for the market. Now, let's not forget that the whole market is less than, you know, a 900 billion. I'm not saying that that's tiny, but it's still not significant enough to create any kind of stress in the market. Unless we're missing something that we don't know at this point. I think what's important, David, when you watch that clip and that was the absolute peak in the.com bubble, yes, there was a massive shakeout. There was a massive consolidation, but I would argue the internet and tech evolved far beyond what any of us ever thought it would be in 2000. I wonder if we're going through the same thing with crypto and NFTs that it got a great start. There is going to be a shakeout of Sonya's right. There's actually a P loose here, in Pinelloman.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,841,2022-11-19 11:18:07
18228," and NFTs that it got a great start. There is going to be a shakeout of Sonia's right. There's probably going to be a lot of regulation. But when I talk to the young people on our desk and our platform, there's still a big believer. And if the millennials are a believer, 22 years from now, they're going to be looking at disc clip. And I hope we got it right. That's fascinating. There is no question as a generational issue here. Let's come back to the current generation and people who's old as I am. I'm older than you are, but it's all like, what about bonds? Right now. Do you invest in bonds? For the first time in a decade, absolutely. And I will tell you that we're seeing interest from everywhere now. Every wealth management platform in JPMorgan, every institutional client, they're coming to us. They're putting money in bonds. They're looking to commit more. And they haven't done so for years. If I look at where we got to at the start of the year, a general bond fund, the Bloomberg Ag yielded 1.7%. Now we're up at 4.7%. We have 3% higher yields. And that's going to track investment. And as I said, I think the Fed is closely in. I don't know if they get to 5%. We're kind of in the 4.5, 4.3 quarters percent. That's going to bring a lot of stability to the market at these levels. Bonds are back. So I'm saying you manage a very amount of money. What about for you? Are bonds attractive at this point? Are you just equities? I think as said, what is very interesting right now is even in any foundation or endowment or the assets that we manage, you're finding exactly the same phenomenon where people had moved away from bonds and cash. And we're all equities and private investments moving back into holding bonds. And as we're reaching that 4.5% that Bob talked about, a much more interest in bonds in a more balanced portfolio. And of course, people are looking at cash with 4% at the treasury bills at the level that is much higher than cash is earned in a very long time. But I think the bigger thing that is happening in the portfolios we're looking at is obviously a lot of investors, institution investors have been also investing in venture private equity real estate in private form. And I think that is going to some sort of transformation too. Well, let's take a segue if we could from that sort of investment in the COP27. As we're speaking right now, it's still going to end on Saturday. Right now, of Sony, you know far better than I do. It looks like it's going to be difficult for them to get to the objectives that they had. You're absolutely right. So far, as we know tonight, the latest news was not too positive, not things could change tomorrow of morning, but they didn't really have anything major to announce. Again, as you remember in COP26, they had the G-Fans, which was a large number of large asset managers, signing up to make pretty significant shifts in their carbon print. But most recently, they started walking back from that or not wanting to sign quite on what they had agreed to in COP26. So I think it's very, very important, as we're having these meetings, maybe they shouldn't be every year. Maybe they should be every other year or less often, but show some sort of progress. And the most important part of the discussion this time, David, has been the fact that developing countries, again, have felt that they are in some cases suffering, because if they're an island economy, they're going underwater. If they are affected by droughts and by floods, a lot of it might be caused by those who did use a lot of carbon over the last 10, 20 years. And they're asking if they could get help. And that help is really not coming. And I think that is the really major summary of COP27, which is that the expectations of investments into climate are probably less than what we expected going into the COP. Well, and just picking up on that on the investments in it, Bob, I want to come back to you, because I want to think at least I'm taking away from COP27. You can certainly hear, listen to John Kerry, the president's special envoy on this subject. We're not going to get to it from public money alone. It's going to take a firm out of private investment as a bond person. And there are their priorities. Mr. Yea",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,842,2022-11-19 11:22:15
18229," You can certainly hear, listen to John Kerry, the President's special envoy on this subject. We're not going to get to it from public money alone. It's going to take a fair amount of private investment as a bond person. Are there bonds that are green bonds or in the climate area that make sense as a business matter? There are. I think for sure, if you're going to finance something, which is what bond investors do, you want something that has something of a green agenda to it. And we're hearing that from our clients, there's more and more money coming into the space. I think of Sonia, help is on the way for the island economies. The large-scale investors want to commit capital to this space. Well, the inflation reduction act, as it's called, a lot of people object to that title, put a lot of money into the game here on that private side of Sonia. Is it making a difference in the projects that are getting financed? No question. I think Dara is a very powerful act and is the largest amount of money going in. And I think that will really help us in the U.S. to invest a lot more in climate-related food and egg, in battery storage, in residential and in community-related solar and wind. So that will be a major, major push. And we're seeing, as Bob mentioned, a lot of movement. I agree with him. I think it's just that in COP, where you expected public money to go in, there was a sort of disappointment with that. And the private sector is doing a lot, the young generation is doing a lot. We just need the public sector to jump in when it comes to it outside of the IRA, of course. Bob, last word, are you seeing a difference in your part of the business for the government tax policy when it comes to green bonds? We are. Yeah, absolutely. It's making a real difference, you see it? It is from our perspective. So yeah, everything we see, that... And we didn't touch on the regulation. There's going to be more regulation poking through what qualifies as a green bond or not, and also to prevent any greenwashing, either in specific bonds or in bond funds. So watch this space. Yeah, okay. We're particularly with the new Congress coming in. Thank you so much. Really great to have both of you. This is Fsani Beshlas of Rock Creek and Bob Michael of JP Morgan.

This week in Asia we're going to be taking a close look at two big elections. Now in Malaysia, voting took place this Saturday just over a month after parliament was dissolved for a snap poll. And then meanwhile, Taiwan, that holds midterms this coming weekend. That's going to be a pulse check on the popularity of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party. As of course, we see geopolitical tensions continue to rise in the region. ECO-wise, the highlight is on central bank meetings in Korea and New Zealand. And we're going to be live from Seoul for the B-OK with expectations there for a half point hike. Plus, the RBNZ predicted to deliver its six straight 50 basis point move. The 2022 World Cup kicks off on Sunday in Qatar. The tournament is being held in the winter for the first time due to the blistering summer temperatures in the region. Thursday, CES-RATE decision by Sweden's Riksbank, economist forecast a 75 basis point hike, but surging food prices could tip the bank to raise by even more. We'll also on the same day get an account of the ECB's most recent policy meeting. And last, certainly not least, you energy ministers will be meeting to discuss policy outlook as Europe heads into the winter. A holiday short and weak for the observance of Thanksgiving Day, the main focal point for the week, it will center around the release of the FOMC minutes from that November meeting, a meeting that saw the Fed raise interest rates by 75 basis points for a fourth straight time. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said then that U.S. interest rates would go higher than earlier projected, but several Fed members since have indicated that they may be ready to downshift. A handful of earnings next week to watch, including Zoom video, deer, analog devices, S-by, and Nordstrom, keep an eye on those last two for a read on the strength of the consumer as the traditional kickoff to the holiday shopping season in the U.S. begins on Friday. The main theme to watch there will be the flight to discounted items by cash-strapped consumers that seem willing to spend, but maybe not have the same capacity as they did a year ago. David? Thanks to Annabelle Druller's Danny Burger and Romaine Bostic. Coming up, we saw it happen in the guilt market, could a crisis come to the markets for U.S. treasuries, and would it come from a lack of liquidity? We're going to ask former vice chair of the Fed, Richard Clarita of FOMCO. This next on Wall Street Week on Bloomberg. We're going to ask former vice chair of the Fed, Richard Clarita of FOMCO. Da uniqueness. While Tesla's in the like make for good headlines, the reality is that even if every car on the roads today won electric, it wouldn't be enough to curb global emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions from transportation account for about 29% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. So what about the other 71%? Building to crowds America burn fossil fuels to operate. What we want to do is make that all electric. Instead of burning oil and gas to give us the energy and electricity we need, we want to do 100% clean energy.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,844,2022-11-19 11:30:57
18231," is make that all electric. Instead of burning oil and gas to give us the energy and electricity we need, we wanna do 100% clean energy, all electric. We want to turn buildings into Tesla's. Just like a Tesla or an electric vehicle is all electric with no fossil fuels, we wanna do that with our buildings. And if we can do it in one building, we can do it in all buildings. And if we do it in all buildings, we'll reduce 30% of US greenhouse gas emissions. This is Wall Street Week, I'm David Weston. We spent a good deal of this week trying to figure out where the Fed is heading on rate increases. And part of what we were watching was the Fed's vice chair, Leo Brandard, who gave us at least some hope that we might be getting closer to slowing down. I think it will probably be appropriate soon to move to a slower pace of increases. But I think what's really important to emphasize, we've done a lot, but we have additional work to do both on raising rates and sustaining restraint to bring inflation down. We're welcome now, Ms. Brandard's predecessor as vice chair, Richard Clarita, now global economic advisor to Pimco. So Richard, thank you so much for being back with us. Good to have you back with us. So do you agree with your successor there? Do you think we're at least approaching a point where we might slow down the pace of increases? David, I do. The Fed has done a lot this year. In fact, it'll be the fastest pace of rate heights since the early 1980s. I do anticipate that at the December meeting, they'll slow the pace from 75 to 50 basis points. And I think as we move into 2023, I think they think and I agree that they're close at least to a pause, probably in the first half of next year. They said in the November statement, they've done a lot and they want to see how the rate heights are impacting the economy. So Richard, you have the advantage of having been in the room and having been in the room relatively recently. Give us a sense of what they're looking at their dashboard because I'm going to say the economic numbers sometimes point in different directions. On the one hand, we do have some indications like the CPI numbers that may be slowing down a little bit the inflation. And they had the overall inflation still pretty high. It is and you know the challenge that that faces and other central banks in the world is that the economy is running hot and in particular, wages in the economy are growing much faster than consistent with the 2% longer run goal. And so I think that the Fed will be looking at the labor market data. It'll also be looking at inflation expectations. We have downshifted demand growth. There's an imbalance between demand and supply. And this year, demand growth has already downshifted. So that's an important thing to note. We're certainly along the way to where we need to be. But the Fed has more to do and we need to get inflation back down towards the 2% objective. So everyone seems to agree there's more for the Fed to be done. We just heard Leo Brenner say exactly that. The question is how much more. And part of the question is what's the terminal rate? I mean, how far up do we go? We had some somewhat conflicting indications this week, actually. And the banks basically project these things are coming up with very different sorts of answers. What determines that terminal rate? And let me ask you, perhaps more pointedly, some people think the Fed was a little slow getting off the market and getting going. Does the slowness of getting started mean the terminal rate would have to be higher necessarily? David, I don't think so. I think what launching the rate heights in March did mean. And I think Chair Powell recognized this pretty early on was that it made sense to get to the destination pretty quickly. And that's why we've had the four successive 75 basis point heights. My sense right now is the committee believes. And I share the view that my baseline view is I want to get the funds rate around 5%.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,845,2022-11-19 11:35:05
18232," Hi, my sense right now is the committee believes and I share the view that my baseline view is I want to get the funds rate around 5% if the inflation data comes in on the soft side maybe 4.3 quarters if it comes in on the hot side maybe 5.4 or perhaps as President Ballard indicated maybe north of that but I think around 5% in the spring will be at a level where they've done a lot they realize that inflation responds to policy with a lag and I think that that will be a good place to take stock so I think that I wouldn't call that necessarily the terminal rate I hope it is if the inflation data doesn't improve then they may have to do more but I think they will pause at around 5%. So Richard I think you just put the figure on the thing that at least perplexes me which is a two-place function I mean you've got what the rates are you also have what inflation is and how restrictive that is depends on how far and how fast inflation comes down so going into the spring if you're at 5% how far down do you get need to get inflation before you say okay that's restrictive enough. It's an excellent point because typically monetary policy does operate with a lag so the Fed wants to look ahead and indeed for example governor Waller and others have made reference to comparing the policy rate to where professional forecasters think inflation will be towards the end of of the year and I appreciate that point my own research actually indicates that's a simple thing to do I think the challenge they face David is that quite frankly the Fed's record at forecasting inflation has not been very good including what I was there last year and so I think it's going to be a balance between adjusting policy according to both the forecast and the incoming data Richard is not just the rates that are going on we also have so-called quantitative tightening as you try to run down the balance sheet which had gone so far up give us your sense of what that is doing right now to financial conditions in the United States. Well David it is tightening conditions again quantitative tightening is is reversing quantitative easing so the Fed's balance sheet is shrinking now it's been very well telegraphed and so markets certainly understand the pace and the modalities of tightening but it is serving to tighten financial conditions and that's consistent with what the Fed wants to do in terms of raising rates. So Richard that takes us to a subject that I know you've heard a lot about we read about all the time which is perhaps a problem with liquidity in the treasury market there's more volatility in the treasury market I understand if that's inherent in raising rates the question is is there additional volatility because there's not as much liquidity we hear at least anecdotally that some people are having difficulty buying and selling large lots of treasuries. Yeah well it's true I went back and looked I had the privilege 20 years ago of serving as assistant treasury secretary in 0 1 or 0 2 and in those years debt outstanding was about three trillion dollars about 30 percent of GDP this year it's 23 trillion dollars or a hundred percent of GDP so quite simply the amount of debt outstanding and the amount of treasury issuance is vastly larger than it was 10 or 15 years ago and the plumbing of the intermediation system for treasury says not really expanded can commonly with that and so as a result there is evidence on occasion of ill liquidity in the market certainly in extreme cases as we observed in March of 2020 or September 2019 it becomes even more evident and so I think policymakers at the Fed and the treasury and other agencies are looking at ways in which treasury market functioning can be improved and I think it's certainly something that should be studied and improved. And what are possible options if they do conclude there's an issue there one of my suppose would be reversing and going back to quantitative easing that's one way to do it another might be actually to ameliorating at least some of the restrictions in regulation and repose after the 2008 great financial crisis which really is i used to took a lot of the big banks and it limited their participation in the market. Well it's it's right and so I think that one of the things David that we did in in the spring of 2020 is that we did relax something called the supplementary leverage ratio in the sense that we would not count bank reserves or treasury holdings against that leverage ratio the ideas we want to do encourage banks to lend in the pandemic shutdown and and the Fed indicated when it left those exemptions.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,846,2022-11-19 11:39:27
18233," against that leverage ratio. The idea is we wanted to encourage banks to lend in the pandemic shutdown. And the Fed indicated when it left those exemptions lapsed that it would begin, it would review whether or not it made sense to include treasuries and reserves in that leverage calculation. I'm sure that analysis is ongoing, but I think that's certainly something worth serious study. What is the rationale, actually, for the SLR? I don't not sure I understand it, because I would think the treasuries are as close to risk-free as possible. You know, the history of this is before the GFC, David, we had risk-based standards for banks. And so treasuries are not risky, other bonds are more risky. There was a sense broadly in the global community, not just in the US, but through the Basel process in Europe and Asia. Central Bank and policymakers agreed that it made sense to have a supplementary leverage ratio. That typically would not be binding most of the time, but it could prevent, if you will, financial institutions from gaming an entirely risk-based system. However, you know, we discovered in March of 2020 the banks were in great shape. The banks were part of the solution, not part of the problem. And there can be perverse consequences of having a supplementary leverage ratio, especially when the central banks are doing large amounts of key lead. Is the creating reserves, which the system has to absorb? So I think it's certainly something that Fed could address, and I think it could make a lot of sense. Russ, thank you so much for being on Wall Street Week. I hope you'll come back often. It's really good to have you, which would clear it up of PIMCO. Coming up, we're going to wrap up the week with our special contributor, Larry Summers of Harvard. That's next on Wall Street Week on Bloomberg. Man, thank you for being with us, Greg. So what's the best investment advice you've ever been given by anybody? The compound interest, the compounding of returns is an incredible miracle of business, finance, and human existence. Everything you learn is additive every day and if you keep added and don't quit, it's an incredible miracle. And it's not just interest. It was always said about compound interest returns, compound business returns, compound human returns. They're all very additive because you learn every day and if you keep added, it's very, very helpful. In your observation of investors, what do you think is the biggest mistake that average investors make? Selling at the wrong time. And they sell when the prices go down? Yes. Or, yes. They're just saying, look, people have conviction or if they invest for the right reasons, just keep adding.<|ur|><|translate|> This is Wall Street Week. I'm David Weston. Welcome back now. Our special contributor, Larry Summers of a Harvard, to wrap up the week for us. Larry, thank you so much for being back with us. A lot of us spent a lot of the week actually trying to figure out where the Fed is headed, particularly where the terminal rate is. And we had conflicting, I think, at least somewhat conflicting answers out of the Fed, including with Mr. Bullard, the Fed president, saying, well, five, five and a quarter, and then put up a chart using the Taylor rule that suggested seven. Where are we? Look, no one knows. I think it's a mistake to be slated.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,847,2022-11-19 11:44:12
18234," Look, no one knows. I think it's a mistake to be slavish about Taylor rules. The market thinks the number is going to be about five. I look at things and my senses there's more room for that to be too low than there is for that to be too high. But it's pretty clear that we've had the big moves on this cycle and now we're going to be finishing that process off. My view is that there's more risk from stopping prematurely and not really curing inflation and setting the stage up for a re-acceleration of inflation after it comes down. I see that as a bigger risk than going too far because going too far would mean bringing inflation down below 2%. And that still seems to me like an awfully remote risk starting from where we are. But I think that the Fed has this in the right place when it says that they're going to move up somewhat more and they're going to take stock of the situation and see what the inflation data is saying and seeing what the inflation forecasts are saying when we get to next get to the spring of next fall spring winter rather spring of next year. I have to say that if they hadn't made as many mistakes as they did of excessive optimism about inflation they probably have a little more room than they do to rely on forecasts that hadn't yet proved out that inflation was going to come down. Larry, you and I talk a lot about monetary policy even fiscal stimulus and things but geopolitics have also factored increasingly and some of the issues having to do with the economy. This week we had what is potentially we don't know if it is an important development in the the meeting of President Xi of China and President Biden. What do you make of those discussions and even ongoing discussions because now we have the USTR a madam tie actually meeting with her counterpart. What do you make of the situation with China right now in the United States? Look as Churchill famously said George ought is a lot better than bang bang and so the fact that they had a meaningful conversation that lasted more than three hours the fact that they both came out of the conversation with the sense that there had been satisfying dialogue the sense that there are some follow on steps. I think that's all to the good. What it's really going to mean? What really is going to happen? Is there going to be constructive movement out of those dialogues? I think that's something we're going to have to wait and see but I'm encouraged by but I what by what I saw and I think it means that President Biden's whole trip has to be regarded as a success. The United States back in the game with respect to climate in Shammel Shake the meeting with Xi I don't think this G20 will be long remembered but at a very vexing moment there could have been some kind of breakdown and there certainly was not that. Well as a minimal thing I've read some places people say at least there is a G20 and they came out with a joint communique and it was fairly tough on Russia I think it's fair to say and the reporting behind the scenes are is that some of the developing countries like Indonesia and India helped drive that process which might might I don't want to overeat it suggest that maybe we're taking a half step back toward multilateralism. I think I think I think we are I think that what Russia has done has really shocked the conscience of the world and has affected very very many countries we'll have to see how this plays out I think we need to remain aware that in the original vote in the UN General Assembly there were countries with",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,848,2022-11-19 11:48:07
18235," I have to see how this plays out. I think we need to remain aware that in the original vote in the UN General Assembly, there were countries with more than half of the world's population who have stained onto Russia's side, who declined to join in condemning Russia. So I think we've got a lot of work to do. And we in the United States tend to be a bit over optimistic about the extent to which all others see us as the, in the benign way, that we see ourselves. It's such an important point. And it takes me back at least to China, because it seems to me that sometimes we've been overly optimistic. I mean, for example, going back to the time we had been into the WTO, we thought China was going to become more like us. And then we go over the other extreme of being, perhaps, overly pessimistic about China. I guess my question for you is former treasury sector, among other things. How do we play both sides of that? We don't know how we'll end up. How do we keep open the realistic possibility we can really work closely with China, but also protect ourselves against the possibility of confrontation? We in the United States probably need to be careful about our evangelizing influence. I don't think it's really for us to tell China how they should organize their entire society. I think it's for us to stand up for some of our fundamental interests in security, in fair economic competition, but to leave it at that point. I think we're going to need to be very careful with respect to our diplomacy on the issue of Taiwan. I think we need to be very careful about giving China the sense that we are trying to change the traditional one-China policy, because I think that could risk disastrous conflict. So I think the operative words for us need to be respect for them, respect for positions and the fundamental interests that they have. And at the same time, absolute insistence on our own. And I would say one other thing, David. I think ultimately we will prevail in this broad contest with China. But I think if and when we prevail, it is going to be more than anything else on the strength of our example. And that's why domestic renewal at home, whether the issue is scientific innovation or infrastructure, whether the issue is doing something about opioid deaths or whether the issue is strengthening our education system, whether the issue is building on the greatness of our universities or the greatness of our national parks. Ultimately, it's going to be our ability to remain the country that's the envy of the world, the country to which people want to come that is going to determine our success. And if we change our focus from building ourselves up to tearing China down, I think we will be making a very risky and very unfortunate choice. Laura, I want to make a very large turn here. I've had the benefit of talking to you about the masters, about basketball. I was going to talk to about Taylor Swift. She's a rather popular pop music star and ticket master because we now know the Department of Justice is investigating possible antitrust problems there because of ticket master, which does, after all, have a 70% market share that's been under investigation for some time. I don't know if you know much about Taylor Swift, although I am concerned about you getting tickets, which apparently seems to be difficult. But more broadly, what is it say, perhaps, about some of the problems with over-concentration in the economy? You know, I want to say two things about that, David. The first is that if the government made a website that functioned as badly as ticket masters has here, everybody would be laughing and scorning the government. And so the next time the private sector says that...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,849,2022-11-19 11:52:28
18236," has here. Everybody would be laughing and scorning the government. And so the next time the private sector says that you know the public sector can't do anything right this was a private sector building a website sort of like that to build a website for Obamacare sort of like they have to build websites at the IRS or like they have to build a build websites for student loan debt relief and the private sector utterly failed. And that's something that we just have to remember the next time somebody wants to say everything about government is hopeless. Yeah we are hungry. We have faith trust. Yeah Larry we're going to have to leave it there. I'm so sorry we're humble we have much to be humble about. Larry thank you so very much that's Larry. Some of us are a very special contributor here on Wall Street Week coming up. A lot of people get hurt when there's a collapse like that of FTX but who stands the benefit that's next on Wall Street Week on Bloomberg. Japan's critical role in the global economy is changing as the world recalibrates. After decades of stagnation Japan's leaders are forging a more innovative and sustainable path forward to revitalize the nation. Corporate giants, policymakers and pioneers tell us how they're doing just that every week on Japan ahead right here on Bloomberg television. On the David Rubensstein Show here to peer conversations I uncover the untold stories of the world's most successful leaders. Watch Wednesdays on Bloomberg Television. Finally one more thought. If Tom Brady's forage it's got to be good right. I'm getting into crypto. With FTX you're in. Despite that endorsement from the greatest quarterback of all time the collapse of Sam Bankman freeds FTX has brought heartbreak to a lot of people wiping out in one fell swoop what was estimated to be a $32 billion empire leaving what its lawyers now say could be as many as a million creditors holding the bag. And by the way triggering a class action lawsuit against Tom Brady and others paid to tout FTX to the world. The ripple effects of FTX and the rest of the Sam Bankman freeds empire now beginning here as we wait for bankruptcy proceedings. All of which has shaken the confidence of many investors that's according to Citadel's Ken Griffin FTX is one of these absolute travesties in the history of financial markets. People are going to lose billions of dollars. And that undermines trust in all financial markets. But as bad as the FTX collapse may be it's only the latest in a series of major meltdowns we've seen in recent years. Just think back to 2001 when that mythical energy giant Enron hit the skids. Its former CEO Jeff Skilling reflected back on the loss in his later testimony before Congress. I am devastated by an apologetic about what Enron has come to represent. No words can make things right. Too many people have been hurt too much. Or WorldComp. Telecommunications phenom of the late 90s that followed Enron into bankruptcy. In 2002 wiping out a market cap of $186 billion and sending its f**k.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,850,2022-11-19 11:56:55
18237," The telecommunications phenom of the late 90s that followed and run into bankruptcy in 2002, wiping out a market cap of $186 billion and sending its former CEO Bernie Ebers to prison despite his trying to seek protection behind the Fifth Amendment. I've been instructed by my counsel not to testify based on my Fifth Amendment constitutional rights. Or that emblem of the first internet bubble, pets.com with that cute sock puppet mascot, which was an instant market hit when it went public and just as quickly went flop. What goes up must come down. All of these notorious failures shared a bold vision, a confident leader and a belief that they'd come up with a better mouse trap, just like Mr. Bankman Fried. And if FTX follows the pattern, it will share one other thing with colossal failures through the years. A lot of lawyers making a lot of money despite all the carnage. When N-Run went into bankruptcy, it had assets of over $65 billion. In the ultimate resolution, shareholders were wiped out at a loss of $74 billion. But the lawyers, they walked away with over $1 billion along with the accounts. WorldCom was three times as big, losing investors in estimated $175 billion. While the lawyers were making over $10 million a month in a proceeding to last it well over a year. And it was forced into bankruptcy, amid one of the most turbulent periods in our economic history, which culminated in a catastrophic crisis of confidence and a run on the bank. But those were all small potatoes compared with Lehman, a bankruptcy that wiped out between $46 billion and $63 billion according to the New York Fed. And netted the lawyers and other consultants a cool, get this $6 billion. So we'll see how much the FTX creditors end up writing off. Much less the token holders. As much pain as they're feeling though, you can be sure that there's one group that will come out okay. It's always the lawyers. That does it for this episode of Wall Street Week. I'm David Weston. This is Bloomberg. See you next week. Welcome to Dave Wiech. with your fancy hands. I'm going to deal with your night because it's really bothering me. Ah, my night. Yeah. He's a troublemaker. Yeah.

18238," Welcome to the world of decentralized finance, Bloomberg's covering all things crypto, the people, the transactions and the technology Bloomberg crypto Tuesdays. Welcome to the earth shot prize innovation summit. I'm François Lacqua here at the Plaza Hotel in New York City. This event powered by Bloomberg featured the finalists selected by the earth shot council launched by Prince William. The shot is a global initiative that drives innovation on solutions to climate change and environmental issues in the following categories. Protect and restore nature. Clean our air, revive our oceans, build our waste free world, fix our climates. So over the next half an hour we'll bring you all the highlights from this most important gathering. This is Bloomberg. Protect and the environment was of course close to my grandmother's heart and I know you should have been delighted to hear about this event and the support you're all giving our earth shot finalists. The next generation of environmental pioneers. Together in this room are the people and organisations who will help us to achieve the earth shot mission to repair, restore and rejuvenate our planet within this current decade. That mission is not simple. Just as President John F. Kennedy so famously said, as he challenged the United States for America to unite behind the goal of putting man on the moon, we choose to do these things not because they are easy but because they are hard. I know that the world is an uncertain place right now that many families and communities across the globe are facing unimaginable challenges, from conflicts to energy crisis and food shortages. While addressing these in the short term, we must also remain resolutely focused on tackling the greatest challenges that threaten our tomorrow. Because if we don't, the changing climate will only serve to entrench these immediate challenges into fundamental global issues, severely impacting the lives of each and every one of us. That is why our collective mission is so urgent but there is huge reason to be optimistic. The 2021 cohort of earth shot winners and fineness is evidence that we can succeed. That we can protect our world for our children, our grandchildren and the generations that will follow them. These pioneers exemplify the leadership needed in this decade of change. They include inspiring activists, brilliant innovators, a forward thinking city and even an entire country making a real difference. But they cannot do it alone. This must be a team effort. We must come together behind their innovative solutions to ensure they reach their full potential with peace and scale. While my message today is one of gratitude and encouragement, I also acknowledge that you cannot succeed in isolation. As governments, we have a responsibility to create the incentives and the space for you to flourish, a receptive environment for change and the accountability that comes with guardianship. In many nations, the foundation for this approach has been laid for us long ago if we choose to listen. Where I come from, I'll tear on New Zealand, a beautiful place you must visit. Our indigenous people hold a world view that every single living and non-living thing is connected. Our people, our plants, our animals, descendants of Ranganoi, the sky father and Papa Tuanuku, the earth's mother and their children. And so it follows that people and nature are kin, are family. And we must care for one another in the spirit of Katiaki Tanga, which translates into guardianship by the people of the land for the next generation. In short, koha ho te taiau, koha ho, I am the environment and the environment is me. Our life source, our economy, our future. Now, I've seen this in action.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,852,2022-11-19 12:05:25
18239," ko aho, i am the environment, and the environment is me. Our life source, our economy, our future. Now I've seen this in action first hand many times, not least in my own backyard, the Pacific, where the ocean is a source of protein, income, culture, and connection. Now it is a source of challenge as it rises up and begins to inundate small island nations. It can be confronting to hear and see the stories of just how real these challenges are, but none of us are here because we have given up, but because we believe there is a way to change the future. We are not only part of the nature, but we are nature. Nature is living element. For indigenous people, nature is whole. Our planet is alive. The rivers are her blood. The trees are her hair. The soil, her skin, the wind, her breeze. And indigenous peoples, our planet they know, they are the doctor. We are protecting 80% of the world's biodiversity, because our way of life do not harm nature at the opposite. We are strengthening ecosystems. We improve biodiversity by cooperating with the birds, and trees, listening to the winds, observing the cloud, learning from even the little insect. We protect nature by setting up our own limits. We don't take more that mother earth can give, and we give back. We protect the sacred trees. We don't destroy the field of the medicinal plants. We choose, pre-susely, the animal that we can kill to just keep the balance of the ecosystem. As all of us know in this fight, no one can afford to sit on the sidelines. No one can claim that climate change is somebody else's problem, or shrug it off for future generations to address. We're all affected by a warming planet. We see that every day. And decisions being made right now will determine our shared tomorrow. So we must choose, and we must act, as united nations ourselves. Our progress depends on collective action, on collective ingenuity. If we stick together, we can make fixing the climate the greatest project and greatest achievement of our lifetimes. We have the science. We have the solutions. Now all the world needs is political will. Together, we can create a future where rampant carbon is removed from the atmosphere, where green buildings and green business transform the levability of communities, where easy access to renewable energy enables greater equity, where sustainable agriculture feeds a growing global population. The needs are urgent, and the costs of inaction are worse than any nightmare. But let us be driven by hope, not fear, by optimism, not despair. Because hope is not passive. Hope is the ultimate source of renewable energy, pushing us forward every day to try and try again. Today, the Earth Shop Prize Innovation Summit in partnership with Mike Bloomberg and Bloomberg Philanthropies will ask each and every one of us what we can do to accelerate progress to repair our planet this decade. And offer solutions on how to collaborate to drive this ambitious but essential climate agenda. We will continue to drive impact around system changing climate solutions and amplify the Earth Shop Prizes call to accelerate progress to repair our planet through collaboration and innovation. But most importantly, we will remind ourselves what can be achieved when we turn pessimism to optimism and optimism into action.

18240," Pieved when we turn pessimism to optimism and optimism into action. Coming up, but more from the panelists and finalists here at the earth's sharp prize innovation side. This is Bloomberg. Imagine simply climbing a cable into space. The concept is known as the space elevator. Not only could it significantly change how we leave planet earth, but it could also completely transform humanity's relationship with space. And there are scientists who think we could have already built it. We have the material, we have the technology, we have the lasers, we have the climbers, we have all of them. If a private entity wants to build it or a government, they can build it. It will change society. We have no clue how colonizing in the space, how really spreading out of the space, really change our society over the next 50 to 200 years. It will be completely different. No one covers the world like Bloomberg. Writing's on the wall for the bank of England. Just the oil has spray painted the front door. Recession in Europe, UK and possibly the US. Presidents are out in full force celebrating the election victory of former president, Lula, that's the only way. With unmatched reach in resources from more than 120 countries, the moment news breaks 24 hours a day. Bloomberg, your global business authority. Everything you need to get set to the start of US traded. Bloomberg, the open with Jonathan Ferrell. Drilling down in the numbers and preparing you as only Bloomberg can weekdays on Bloomberg. Welcome back to the best of the earth's sharp prize innovation summit. The guests featured ranged from heads of state to leaders of grassroots environmental organizations. Well amongst them was philanthropist and Microsoft founder Bill Gates. Yeah, it's too bad you can't do things overnight in either mitigation or adaptation. When I last went through Europe, people were the leaders were all saying, hey, give me technologies so I can tell Putin to get lost. And I said, hey, in five years you're going to be able to call him up. And they were like, no, we'd like it. No, it's the year alone. Okay, that, how's your planning permission regime and all the planning for that future grid? Seeds typically between the timing start and they get out in the farmers fields is about eight years. Now we have a pipeline of innovations. We've been funding the CG system for 20 years now. It's funded about a billion year. People care at all about adaptation. That thing will be funded at two billion a year. I mean, there won't be anything close to the impact of climate-related seeds, climate-related maize, rice, wheat, sort of a millet. And thank goodness because of human genetics, we know how to do the editing. Thank goodness because of AI, we know how to find the alleles. Because of drones, we can measure stuff in the field. So there's huge advance in terms of how the whole seed ecosystem moves at full speed. The timing is very tricky here. The warming doesn't stop the day you get to zero emissions. There's a lag in this system. It's about a 20-year lag. So you haven't seen that Earth Tempestor's not equilibrated to the atmospheric CO2 content. So when you get to zero, that's not, it's not like 2051. Take my air conditioner away. No, it starts quite a bit later. And so you have to look at what the peak is and you can't just plan for, okay, 2030, 2030 is where your maize production in central Africa is down 25%.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,854,2022-11-19 12:14:08

It's down 70% and you will have switched in most of those areas from a fairly heat sensitive crop to sorghum. Now sorghum productivity is super low so we'll get people to do better maize for these next 15 years and then they are going to have to switch to sorghum. It is tough when you see the floods in Pakistan and nobody expected that. If the goal of climate was to make us pay attention, wow, that is way beyond expectation. So some of that up to money literally will just be disaffered to recovery money. The boundary of what's what is also pretty confusing. What is food aid? If climate is causing some food production losses, all world food program money is that all climate adaptation money? It's certainly the need for it's going up. That's a system that's about 6.5 billion a year. So relative to the systemic solution, which is the research piece, it's relatively larger. But the demand for that piece, which is the acute half of Pakistani rice got flushed away. So you're going to have malnutrition problems if you don't go in for that. That's also a type of adaptation. And so I do think we're going to bring some rigor to this because the pressure now, you know, the goal of doubling the adaptation money from, they say 20 billion here to 40 billion here. But still peanuts. No, it's very small. I mean, literally, yeah, if you start sticking food aid in there, you know, you can use it up very quickly rebuilding after hurricanes. I mean, we had hurricanes before, but, you know, the cost there are absolutely gigantic. You know, there are ways of stopping wildfires. There are ways of dealing with sea level rise. So the innovation agenda, not just on seeds, the innovation agenda is going full speed on, on mitigation. That's where, you know, there's a hundred companies break through energies funded. And by mitigation, you mean mostly energy. You mean everything to do with energy. You mean generation of energy. You mean batteries. You mean transport. You mean all of the new and there are some renewables that are already traditional. But more that need to come on. So is that's the package that you're talking about mitigation. Yeah, you're also talking about agriculture as mitigation. Yeah, so every every mission emissions. You know, the world tends to focus on past near cars and electricity. That's not a third of emissions. And so the focus on the easiest third, you know, now 4% of new cars are electric. You know, so that's the field that we're further still long about 4% of energy generation is wind and solar. As you triple the size of your grid, we want that to be say, you know, some people would say 100%. Other people might say 70 to 80%. You know, the amount you have to build were, you know, not within a factor of five of the build rate of those. But those are the easy sectors. So cement, you know, clean cement costs over twice as much as the way we make cement today. And it's not it's partly the heating energy. It's partly the basic thing, you know, remember in chemistry when you take calcium carbonated heated you get calcium. That's what makes them out. The thing that goes away that's CO2. And so we have to have a way of making cement, which a number of these innovative steel and iron. There's a whole family of hard to obey sectors. That's true. If you get a vet industrial sector. If you get green hydrogen that's cheap enough, it actually solves quite a large number of those. So the industrial process should go straight to electricity and some you go through, you do your reduction using the, the hydrogen where you would have used some hydrocarbon.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,855,2022-11-19 12:18:31
18242," to electricity and some you go through, you do your reduction using the hydrogen, where you would have used some hydrocarbon concept before. For steel, we actually have companies doing both. We have electricity steel and others doing electricity is the way of replacing the blast furnace. And then we have others that take hydrogen. And if you get the hydrogen cheap enough, you get the super magic thing, which is that the green product doesn't cost more. That's called green premium equals zero. And then your adoption scale is utterly different. If we tried to subsidize steel and cement, say rich countries say, okay, we want to get rid of that, which goes to our 15% of emissions, that's greater than all foreign aid budgets put together. So over 200 billion foreign aid never will pass that number. It's just not politically possible. It's a number that's at about 170 and going down today. Coming up, but more from the panelists and finalists here at the earth's shop prize innovation side. This is Bloomberg. What do you think of when you think of a battery? For most, it's what we use to power devices for both work and play, and maybe even your car. Over the past few decades, they've gotten way more powerful, long-lasting and affordable. But all of this is just a prologue to what the next batteries are going to do. As we drive to an increasingly renewable power driven grid, we also need to be able to store energy and release it later to cover those periods of weather intermittencies that are driving this new grid that we're in. It's a multi-trillion dollar opportunity, and it's imperative that we figure out the solution here. How we store energy on a massive scale is in many ways the central challenge of the fight to stop climate change. Welcome back to the earth's shop prize innovation summit. Finalists of the annual award appeared alongside special guests, including worldwide business leaders, philanthropists, and non-governmental activists. Now, while the 2022 finalists have been announced, our panelists have their eyes on the future, and here's what they have to say. This is the earth's shot decade. We are in a race to repair and regenerate the planet. Some will focus on policy. Some will focus on activism. We are focused on supporting the game changes, the innovators, the entrepreneurs and the problem solvers. We believe in the power of human ingenuity, and grit and determination to create solutions that if scaled could repair the planet. We have only 8% of the ocean protected today, and our earth's shot is, as Pati said, 30 by 30, 30% of the ocean at least, 30% of the ocean protected by 2030. And we know that if we protect the right 30%, not only will we prevent the extinction of many marine species, but also we will produce more fish. And there's going to be these protected areas are going to produce a spillover that will exceed the foregone catch. So we're going to have more fish to eat, food security, livelihoods for people. And we know that for every dollar that we invest in a protected area and a marine reserve that produces.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,856,2022-11-19 12:22:51
18243," food security, livelihoods for people. And we know that for every dollar that we invest in a protected area in a marine reserve, that produces $10 in economic output and creates more jobs. So it's a triple win for marine life, for food security and for climate, and of course for the economy. So that's the goal, the mission, to in the next eight years, and that's where the air shot is really, it's pretty crazy. In the next eight years, we need to quadruple all the ocean protection that has ever happened in human history. Are you optimistic that can be done? I am optimistic, there's no choice. I've seen firsthand the potential that a breakthrough idea can hold. And if we start seeing more of these transformative solutions across all the challenges facing our planet and suddenly our earth shot won't seem so improbable, the work will be difficult, it'll take extraordinary resources, determination, partnership. But we've got all the essentials right here in this room. So what is the challenge? It's the speed, scale, and cost of making these green hydrogen generators. Well, that's exactly what we are working on. Because to make green hydrogen the fuel source of the future, it needs to be cheaper than fossil fuels. And that means, electrolyzers are going to need to be really, really cheap. If you want to take a solution around the globe as quickly as possible, you need to make it standardized, mass-produced commodity. A product that is easy to make and quick to build and cheap as well. And so while some believe electrolyzers need to be large machines, we believe the electrolyzer should be a standardized, mass-producible product that can make green hydrogen anywhere for anyone. In 2030, we imagine millions and millions of projects on restore and not just places on earth where we see nature being brought back, but all of the other nodes that are key to ensuring success. So the technology providers, the nurseries, the seed banks, the funders, the government incentive programs, so that we have an ecosystem that really allows us to leverage the many, many connections within the nature-based solution space. And in 2030, we have been focused on another key area, which is cities and cities require data and insights to take action on climate and to preserve nature, to create more nature and tree canopy. So we've set a goal that we want to- We need more in cities, exactly. Exactly, right. And we've been partnering with cities like Los Angeles to give them insights utilizing AI and geomapping on where all the places that you can create more tree canopy, which reduces urban heat islands, improves air quality sequesters carbon. So we want to bring data and solutions to bringing nature into cities as well as of course preserving and restoring nature. And so one of the goals that we've set is, we want to enable over 500 cities around the world, and we're going to hear from the mayor of Paris after this, to reduce a gigaton of carbon emissions by 2030. And so that's through data, tools, insights, whether that's evolving transportation systems or planting new tree canopy. So that's a big bold target that we want to see achieve by 2030. Anyway, I guess I'm in the wrong place. I came here to invite all of you to the Grouch Convention. But it turns out you're all about my least favorite thing, helping. Oh, you've got me, Oscar. I do like helping people learn how to reuse, repurpose and recycle. Together, everyone in this room can build a world where nothing goes to waste. And that includes even you. Me? Sorry, my guy. I got to get going to that convention, but just between us. Yes. I do have a recycling bin right next to my can. But don't let that get out, OK? It'll ruin my image. But my father believed in the power of the idea. And over time, the vision, the purpose, the courage, it embodied.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,857,2022-11-19 12:27:07
18244," Thanks. But my father believed in the power of the idea. And over time, the vision, the purpose, the courage, it embodied has inspired each generation to take on its own challenges, not because they're easy, but because they're hard. President Kennedy understood that the effort to land on the moon would bring out the best in us, that everyone would have to contribute, that it would require innovation, creativity, teamwork, commitment, and faith. And that world would be better because of it. The Earth Shot Prize has inspired the same spirit of optimism and ingenuity on a global scale to tackle the most pressing challenge we now face, repairing the planet. My family and I are so excited that the Prince of Wales will honor this year's Earth Shot Prize winners in partnership with the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston, a city that is committed to scientific excellence, environmental justice, and the fight against climate change. We're proud that President Kennedy's moonshot legacy still inspires hope, and we look forward to welcoming all of you who are working to ensure a better future here on Earth. And that's all from the Earth Shot Prize innovation site. You can find complete coverage of the event, including full interviews and articles on bloombrev.com. I'm François Lacqua from New York, and this is Bloombrev. I'm going to name a couple of your babies. I don't know if I'm asking you to choose amongst your children, but some of the most recognizable buildings by you, of course, the Millennium Bridge, London City Hall, the Reichstag, and the Great Court British Museum. What was your favorite project to do? The Reichstag does stand out, because, first of all, it's an energy manifesto. So it transforms something that was dependent on fossil fuels, it uses all the technology to produce something which is essentially carbon neutral and there's a public building. That's a statement. It's a symbol of a city. It's a symbol of a nation. It incorporates works of art. It's recycling and existing building, which, as I mentioned earlier, is the ultimate in sustainability. If you can get a new life to a building, it also creates public space at the roof level. It's the most visited parliament in the world, so it puts the public above the politicians who are answerable to them. And that, of course, was made possible by the politicians. So it's a demonstration of democracy in action. You've got to explain this one to me. What does it mean when the White House says we're watching markets carefully? It means they have a Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. They've been an insane... Lots of Bloomberg. Lots of Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg.

18245," I saw a shark tank trailer. Yeah, that was fun. That was fun. What was the most, like, surprising thing about it? How kind, Mr. Wonderful, actually. Softies. I guess he is. Yeah, he's a really nice guy. Did it give you any flashbacks to your YC days and the panic days of early entrepreneurship? Yes, and that they do about 45 minutes of shooting for seven minutes of airing. Yeah. And so if the entrepreneur makes a mistake and they're a few of these, it's totally fine. I'm Tony. I was a product editor at Square. And the four of us came together about six months ago to work on software for small business owners. That's the application video Tony Shoe and his DoorDash co-founders submitted to get a ticket into why combinators prestigious startup accelerator back in 2013. Fast forward nearly 10 years later, and DoorDash has gone from a struggling food delivery story to a public company that's the US leader in delivery. But the big question facing companies now is how to navigate a potentially prolonged economic downturn, joining me on this edition of Bloomberg Studio 1.0 DoorDash CEO and co-founder Tony Shoe. Tony, it's so great to see you. Great to see you too, Emily. In person. I know. You went public in the pandemic. We were talking remotely. But there's nothing quite like an in-person interview. So thank you for being here. It's great to be here. You basically grew up in a restaurant as I understand it. What was it like leaving China, moving to Illinois and starting this new life? It was a classic immigrant story. In many ways, I would say looking back, almost a fairy tale like Journey, where my parents came to the US with $250 in the bank. We immigrated to Illinois, Champaign, or Banna. My dad got his degree at the University of Illinois. My mom put food on the table by working three jobs today, one of which did happen to be in a Chinese restaurant where I moonlight it as a dishwasher. So I got to hang out with mom that way as a way of growing up. And I did that. I mowed lawns. And that's really how I saved up money to buy Nintendo games and do all the things that were the wonders of my childhood. What do you think you learned from that? Mowing lawns early, washing dishes early? I think two things. One, looking backwards, it's just that you have to work to actually get things done. I didn't understand what it meant to live off of food stamps to buy groceries or free and reduced lunch every day inside school. But it was a very empowering feeling to buy my own Nintendo or earn my way to buy my first Apple computer. The second thing was really just the power of independent thinking. My parents, because they were so busy, just trying to make a life for our family that I was largely left alone. So I grew up playing basketball, watching TV. That's how I learned English. I grew up moving around a lot as a kid. And as a result, I think that gave me a lot of time to realize that it's pretty important to think for yourself. So you studied engineering at Berkeley, went to business school at Stanford. And you actually started out as an intern at Square. I did. I can't tell you how many people have said to me, Tony Shoe was my intern. That's where. Like, that's how long I've been doing this and how, you know, DoorDash just kind of came out of nowhere. Yeah, I, you know, it was actually a pretty stiff competition between finishing school, Jack Dorsey and Keith where we're trying to convince me to leave Stanford and work at Square full time. It was a fun and busy period of my time, but I enjoyed both. So how did the idea for DoorDash come about and the decision to not work for, you know, Jack Dorsey and Square, which I'm sure was also kind of intoxicating, right? The idea for DoorDash really came from this, you know, lifelong interest in helping these physical business owners. Really people like my mom. So we talked to hundreds of small business owners. And it was surprising to us that even in 2013, delivery was not a solved problem. There were business owners who would show us literally booklets of delivery orders that they would refuse. I mean, we're talking about thousands of dollars per week, which is, you know, the different.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,859,2022-11-19 12:35:56
18246," There were business owners who would show us literally booklets of delivery orders that they would refuse I mean we were talking about thousands of dollars per week Which is you know the difference sometimes between making payroll and and actually you know surviving And they would just turn them down because they were delivery orders Which to us was a really novel and unfortunate phenomenon and frankly a necessary one and that really became You know the impetus to start to dash you started out driving for competitors, right? I was driving for a lot of different services to try to actually understand you know logistics You know my background I mean as you mentioned more in engineering math I thought I was going to be a cancer researcher I mean that's pretty much what I spent all of my undergraduate days at Berkeley doing That kind of 180'd into world of business But and so I think it's really important to really learn things for yourself You know to think from first principles kind of you know again back to that independent thinking mindset I talked about as a child growing up and you try for Uber lift I even drove for you know services that were a little bit older and a services like FedEx or Domino's and really try to explore You know how does delivery work and is really trying to understand you know every component part I mean it sounds really simple right bring you a Burrito from point A to point B But there were actually twenty steps involved in that delivery It just didn't appear as obvious to the you know naked eyes of the first two years of door to ashes life We did deliveries almost every single day So where did you go from there? I mean I mean it's early days. I know Elon Musk has said starting a company is like swallowing glass and staring into the abyss of death One of the first ones came actually as early as month three of the company's life So we were maybe 11 weeks 12 weeks old as a company There was a big Stanford football game in September and you know long story short We were laid on every single order and we had no ability to turn off the site So it was just horrendous everyone in the company all 12 of us were delivering and everyone You know rightfully so it was furious because of how lately we were and so we had a decision to make You know do we do the right thing and refund you know every single customer which would have cost us about 40% of our bank account Or do we you know do a less right and and survive another day because it was very hard for us at that time to raise capital Which you know was something true for door ashes early history and You know it took us about 30 seconds to click submit free fund and you know the lesson for us Always as a founding team and frankly even today as a as a company is we'd rather die chasing excellence than live to be mediocre It wasn't so obvious either in the in the earlier years I remember in 2016 you did a down-round I think you you actually came on the show around that time How did you weather the doubters and the you know the people who didn't believe there were about a thousand days in the desert Between 2016 17 and 18 sometimes with company building So long as you can convince yourself because time is your you know most precious resource You should keep going and if you can keep going long enough you might get lucky enough to make it so over time How did you balance quality with the need and desire to scale and then scale globally in these types of businesses where it's low-margin high complexity You really have to figure out what your unit of business is you know for us that was a city So in order to before going to 7000 or 10,000 cities globally we made one city work and After city one worked we made city to work and after we started getting higher and higher confidence that we can make baskets of cities work Irrespective of the of the geographies or what you know the customer situation look like or what the merchant makeup was Then we gained the confidence to actually roll out everywhere then came the pandemic Brian Cheskey has said the pandemic was like a torpedo for Airbnb Was it like the opposite for doordash? It was like the biggest wave behind her back which you know had the ability to break us And and it almost did because we grew 2x talking about in 2019 to today five businesses in 27 countries You know much more than just restaurants and and so all of that was created in the last two years The big question is how much do customers keep ordering out in a high inflation?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,860,2022-11-19 12:40:11
18247," And so all of that was created in the last two years. The big question is how much do customers keep ordering out in a high inflation environment? Back in 1997, I was interested in the following question, which is there are a bunch of the dinosaurs called Saurapod dinosaurs, which had really long skinny necks. So Apatosaurus is an example. And I said really long skinny tails. So I made a computer model that showed that in fact the tail of these Saurapod dinosaurs could actually act like a whip, a bullfip. Now the way a bullfip makes that cracking noise is because the tip of the whip actually goes about twice the speed of sound. Okay. And that crack is a sonic boom. Yeah. I think the way they got a date was to impress the females by making loud booms. Watch Bloomberg surveillance early edition for the news you need when you need it. Not that little Akali lines in New York and N Edwards in London. Australia's central bank raises interest rates twice as much as bull cars. Then surveillance for in-depth analysis. Well, outside some key and Lisa Brownbitt's son Jonathan Ferro, the RBI fronts and sensors. How does Japan get away with not raising rates? Can it sustain its normal at a time when everybody else is facing a very different reality? Bloomberg surveillance, be informed, be prepared, be ahead of the game. DoorDash went public, middle of the pandemic. And I remember actually you were coming on Bloomberg and the price doubled at the opening. We were coming out of obviously terrible economic times, you know, the depths of the pandemic. What did that feel like when you're going out into the world starting to sell to public investors and the price just doubles? It was certainly very exciting. It was exhilarating. It was the first time that our company went public. First time that I had ever undergone any of those types of experiences before. But in the back of my head it was that saying that you're never as good or as bad as they say you are. Just remember that. So tease that out for me a little bit because the big question is how much do customers keep ordering out in a high inflation environment? How much long-term sustainability and growth is there really? Even though COVID is now effectively sustained and we understand how to live with it, customers are continuing to order. Those that join us during the pandemic, they're still ordering out about the same rates as those who joined us before the pandemic. And that's because eating out and getting things delivered are pretty complimentary. On the second point around inflation, you know, I can say that in the last 60 years in looking at the data, spend in restaurants and in grocery have only declined in two of those 60 years, including high inflationary times much higher than what we observed today. And so what I think I take, you know, solace in even though I see the fact that there is high inflation, is that customers are going to continue spending on food. And our job is to bring greater and greater affordability. More broadly the economy is in a tough position. Your competitors have announced layoffs and hiring freezes and slowdowns. Is DoorDash considering any of these? I think we've been fortunate mostly because most of our investments that happened during the pandemic really were meant to build new businesses. And those new businesses have continued to grow. New business is, you know, beyond restaurants in categories like grocery convenience or retail. New businesses overseas, you know, we announced a large acquisition in Vult, where that really helped double our overall addressable market to 700 million people. New businesses in building an advertising business, new businesses expanding our services and building a platform to help businesses build their own digital operations. Do you see DoorDash as more of a super app of the future? Or is it something different? Well, I see DoorDash as really solving two problems. And a problem one is how do we bring incremental demand to all the physical businesses as they kind of figure out their own digital inhouse capabilities. And the second problem we're trying to solve is bring tools to these businesses. There's still a lot of competition and delivery. Who do you think survives the delivery?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,861,2022-11-19 12:44:32
18248," out their own digital inhouse capabilities and the second problem we're trying to solve is bring tools to these businesses. There's still a lot of competition and delivery. Who do you think survives the delivery wars? Who doesn't and why? Well delivery is a scale economy's game. You know, at the end of the day, you can survive even doing deliveries from a singular story. You know, there's still mom and pop pizza shops and Chinese restaurants that do their own delivery. Do you see DoorDash as a challenger to like Walmart? Amazon? Well, I see DoorDash, you know, as a champion of local businesses and physical businesses. I don't think that a world in which we just get what we want to buy or consume for a few places is a world that, again, is as worth enjoying living in. It's our job is to make sure that all of these businesses, all of the millions of physical businesses globally, can continue to compete. I do a lot of DoorDash, helps me be a working mom. Whenever I interview you, I get pings from dashers and some of them say they don't get paid enough. Some of them seem pretty angry. What's your response to them? We want the local economy to grow and to thrive. That includes dashers. We have three million dashers that come to the platform every single quarter. And so it's really important to me what they say. And it's, in fact, why, you know, the company, myself included, we still dash due deliveries in other words once a month. You still do deal deliveries once a month? That's why we have a Dasher Community Council that we started three, four years ago now. I want to see one of your memos after a delivery. Are you sending notes? I'm texting. It's not even after the delivery. I'm texting, you know, not texting while I'm driving, but texting after I complete the order. From your deliveries, what have you learned? Everything. All of the details, everything from pay considerations, everything from operations at a store, which stores are a bit faster in their operations or more consistent, which stores are less consistent. Where do you find the last parking space in downtown San Francisco? All of these details matter. They matter for efficiency. They matter for driver pay. They matter for merchant earnings. And so as a result, you know, what I say to dashers is, please continue to talk to me. I'm just Tonya, Dordash. And we're always trying to, you know, make things better. We're not saying that we're perfect, but when we look at, you know, the data that we've collected, you know, the average dashers making $24.25 an hour nationwide when they're on and when they're doing deliveries. And so, and most dashers are pretty satisfied. So Dordash has been expanding internationally. Sounds like you're on the road a lot. I'm on the road. I am on the road. US, Canada, Australia, Japan, where else? Where next? Germany, you know, Israel, Finland, a lot of the Nordics. So we're in 27 countries. And a lot of that is run by, you know, the VULT's team that we were lucky to partner with. Beyond VULT, how are you thinking about M&A? Are there any verticals or areas in particular where you might be interested in acquiring? You know, we have five businesses, the US restaurants business, the new categories business with a focus on convenience and grocery. Non-US International 27 countries are B2B business and are ads business. So we have quite a full play on M&A specifically. It's a high bar. M&A I think sometimes looks a lot better on paper than can be achieved in reality. And I think it's because you're talking about at the end of the day, combining human organizations, not just businesses or products or lines on a spreadsheet. I think you have to deliver upon that promise. And so for us, the bar isn't just does it add to our business, but does it actually add to our culture. You've been piloting rapid delivery, right, rapid delivery, but rapid delivery seems to be contracting. What are you seeing in your pilots? Is this somewhere you think you'll expand or no? So I think customers are always going to have expectations that go in one direction, right? I don't think we're going to want things delivered more slowly over time or at higher prices or with less selection. Our core use case right now is lunch and dinner, which is highly repetitive, highly profitable, which allows us to invest in things like fast deliveries. I take that with great pride. I also take it with great responsibility, remembering to invest in those who maybe don't come from privileged backgrounds.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,862,2022-11-19 12:48:54

This is Bloomberg. I'm curious how you're thinking about AI and Uber shutdown itself driving stuff. How are you thinking about AI and moonshots and potential new technology? Is it just not ready for prime time? When it comes to platform shifts or new technologies, AI, autonomy, other types of technologies, I tend to like to make the investment. I think that's a more appropriate choice to not miss the shift. However, I think it's very important to get the pacing right. I still think that the merits behind what we were trying to do in partnership with the Chebodic team was the right idea in which we can help restaurants effectively build a cheaper cost product. That's ultimately what we were trying to do. But we weren't ready yet with the technology. You recently joined Meta's board. What's it like working with Mark Zuckerberg? It's been fantastic.

It's been a privilege. Facebook isn't a very controversial platform. There's controversy about whether Facebook is really good for the world. Whether Facebook should have as much power as it should. How do you think about that and how are you advising Mark about how do you use that power? With great power comes great responsibility. I think Facebook has a lot of influence. Meta's different properties as I'm sure you cover. For millions of people every single day. That's an enormous privilege and an enormous responsibility that they take incredibly seriously. Like should any company be more powerful than multiple governments combined? I don't think I see it exactly that way. Because it's still a contract between the company and its users. I think what's important for Meta to do and they're doing this absolutely is how do we set the guard rails to make it fair, safe for everyone? And this is very, very, very difficult. You're also an investor. In a number of different startups, one of them is Alchemy, Web3 Company, any plans to accept crypto, any plans for DoorDash to accept crypto? Crypto right now is going through a period where it's trying to figure out what's next in terms of its use case. I think everyone, myself included, very bullish on the technology of what the blockchain enables. What do you think could be the future of blockchain technology in food delivery? In delivery in general? Well, I don't know if it's going to get applied directly to food or to delivery.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,863,2022-11-19 12:53:09
18250," food delivery in delivery in general. Well, I don't know if it's going to get applied directly to food or to delivery. I mean, I think it absolutely has the potential to create a new economic infrastructure, right? An economic infrastructure that can really serve as the basis for new banking systems and et cetera. And so I think that's something more that's 10-general to the world of delivery. Obviously, payments is one part of what we do. But it's not the central thing. So we're going to do a little rapid fire now, a little quicker, fun, questions, favorite food. I've ordered from 1,100 different door dash restaurants. So I actually like to try everything. Your business idol? There are people in retail that have admired. The people that founded everything from Walmart to Costco. The team in Amazon, in e-commerce. The team Elon Musk and what he's trying to do. What about Elon Musk buying Twitter? If he has time to run a third company, I think that'd be fantastic for the world. You grew up in Illinois. You live in California. You like basketball. You're here. Basket favorite team. Bulls. Bulls. Bulls, not warriors. I grew up in the golden days of Michael Jordan, Scotty Peppin, and actually both the early 90s, as well as the later 90s in which they won three in a row. I'm still a Bulls die hard even though we're in the rough patch right now. I hear you also like to run. You run marathons? Well, I don't run marathons today. So just to be clear, but I do run every day. So that's been my sanctuary, if you will, for the past 10 years. Your case is still pretty young. How do you think having kids has changed you as a leader? You know, I think kids are amazing in that they're experiencing the world for the first time. Being able to listen versus to talk at or to dictate an opinion, I think that's been a big lesson. I think the second one is the power of curiosity. Kids, especially my kids at their ages of two and four are asking the question, why a lot? And I think it's the best question. It's also so hard. And it's so hard to answer because it requires clarity of thinking on everything, on the most basic things, to more complicated things. How has being an Asian-American CEO impacted your experience? Well, I think being an Asian growing up where I was the only Asian, and that was kind of my experience in Illinois, it certainly had a big experience. And where it very directly, I saw firsthand whether it was bullying or discrimination. But I think if I were to more broadly classify that to the privileged position that I'm in today, I'm still a minority in the sense that there aren't as many Asian-American CEOs or founders, as maybe founders from other backgrounds. And so I think it's that reminder to, you know, one always recognize that. And then I think secondly to always keep the underdog mentality. Do you think you faced more challenges than others? Because Asian-American CEOs are so underrepresented. I mean, Asian-Americans are underrepresented in leadership roles in tech, full stop. I can't say that, you know, for me personally, in building DoorDash, was that the experience? But look, I think you're writing, calling out that when I look around me, I'm going to look at, especially, public company, founder CEOs, well, hey, there aren't that many, B, when you start filtering for, you know, those from Asian descent, it's a much, much smaller list. And so I take that with, you know, great pride. I also take it with great responsibility. Really, and again, remembering to invest in those who maybe don't come from privileged backgrounds, giving them an equal shot at it, and to always to stay so hungry. You change your name to Tony when you moved? Well, that's five, yeah. To the US, you're five years old, after Tony Danza, who was the star of who's the boss. Correct. I loved that. I did. No one could pronounce my Chinese name. And so I said, okay, well, let's just make it easier. Yeah. And so I walked with my dad to the immigration office and legally changed my name. Did life change?

Honestly, I think I don't see myself that way. And I recognize that that's probably not how others view me. But I really view myself as a teammate. And for me, I think it's trying to make that actually true, make the reality of how I feel, true to the perception that maybe others have of me as the boss and making that distance shorter and shorter.

Big, expensive cities have a lot going for them. But if you live in one, you've probably noticed that these big, expensive cities keep getting more, well, expensive. You could always move away. You might have just started working remotely, so there's really nothing keeping you there. But then again, moving is a hassle. Well, what if someone paid you 10 grand to do it? What if they threw in free office space, a bicycle, or a gym membership? Business and cities and states around the US are doing exactly that, and they're getting a lot of interest. We've had over 50,000 applications. About 90,000 applications. We've had over 1800 applicants from all over North America. So are these nascent programs actually beneficial to their communities and the workers joining them? Or are they little more than flashy advertising campaigns for places looking for an injection of fresh talent? There are the vanguard of a green transition. They're delivering locally at a time of global energy turmoil. Utility companies are having their moment in the sun. Energy is on every one's mind around the world. The independence, energy prices, energy availability. Utilities historically have been viewed as stodgy, slow moving, boring companies. I would not be here if it were anything like that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,865,2022-11-19 13:02:10
18252," The abilities historically have been viewed as stodgy, slow moving, boring companies. I would not be here if it were anything like that. The YouTube is that they're going to thrive in this environment. Other ones will have a diversified energy mix, particularly the ones who have a higher percentage of clean energy resources that is reliable such as nuclear, as well as wind and solar and gas in the mix to back those up. Duke Energy providing regulated gas and electric services to about 10 million customers in seven US states has flourished in the spotlight. Revenues have rebounded since COVID rocked the industry in 2020. The volatility that's driven profits has also created pressures. We're in a period of inflation. We're in a period where commodity prices are high. So every season of leadership is going to have some particular challenge. And Duke will meet these challenges with fresh leadership. After almost a decade at the helm of finance, Steve Young decided to step away from the role. In September 2022, company veteran Brian Savoy became CFO. Why now retire from your position as CFO? I thought it was time. It made a lot of sense. Brian is ready. Succession planning is something that is ongoing at Duke Energy. And this gave us an opportunity to promote Brian, someone who has great financial background, good market and economic background, who also has led businesses, so understands P&L. And so it just felt like the right time to begin that transition. The transition in the C-suite comes as Duke and Barks on a transformation of its business. Aiming to retire all coal by 2035, achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050, and reshape its portfolio around natural gas, nuclear power and renewables. We're basically rebuilding generation and transmission and distribution to meet the needs of the future. We're going to invest $145 billion over a decade. That is a staggering amount of money, which means it's a staggering amount of things we've got to go buy, replace, install, make work. And do it in an affordable way for our customers. That's a tall order. It's a team effort. So, Boy will have plenty of support from Young, who's now Duke's Chief Commercial Officer, and Lynn Good, who is one's Duke's CFO herself. Any advice you want to give him from your CFO hat? C-E-O-Hat, you can't give advice. The CFO hat. The advice I gave him was, you know, jump in with all fours and make this job as big as you can. Because you sit at the nexus of so many things in the Chief Financial Officer role. The business, the regulation, the finance, delivering value to investors and to customers. And I think Brian is very capable of doing that. It's an amazing time to be in this role in this moment. Stressful? Extremely. And daunting. There's a lot going on, but I wouldn't have it any other way. Here's what Duke's Power Generation mix looked like in 2021, with coal and oil nearly a quarter of the portfolio. Here's how it should look by 2030. Renewables will more than triple as a share of the company's power output. We have been putting pieces in place in our regulated business for several years to really accelerate this clean energy transition. Renewables bring price stability because there's no fuel. Right? See, there's a sun shine or the wind. There's typically a significant capital of front investment, but it's predictable. Natural gas is needed to balance the grid and the reliability needs because the wind doesn't blow all the time. The sun doesn't shine all the time. Batteries can't bridge the gap enough. Right? So, our plan is to reduce natural gas over time, but use it as a bridge fuel as we proliferate renewables. And nuclear has been just a tremendous benefit for our customers. And we see promise in future nuclear in the 2030s as we move through transition. That's not the only transition Brian Savoy will manage. Duke wants to focus its time, money, and resources on its regulated businesses. And it's looking for a buyer for its commercial renewable energy holdings. Our commercial business is one that I ran, so I'm very familiar with. And it served us very well, but it is only 5% of our company. Right? And our regulated business.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,866,2022-11-19 13:06:17
18253," But it is only 5% of our company, right? And our regulated business has a clear path to growth and the competition for capital spheres inside our company. And there are a lot of interest. There's a lot of money to invest in green energy. They are performing a strategic review right now of this business and I think it makes sense to do so, right? Because in the utility space, to really get credit in evaluation for a non-regulated business, or a new bull generation, right, you have to do it at the much larger scale. And it does make sense to take a closer look at maybe somebody else's a better sort of capital here and recycle capital to redirect that into the regulated business. Duke Forecasts earnings growth, the 5% to 7% through 2026, driven by a lot of capital investment. The company intends to spend a whopping $145 billion in the next decade, with the lion's share going to changing its energy mix and modernizing its grid. Brian Savoy is in charge of deploying this capital under highly challenging conditions, including the highest inflation and most volatile energy prices in decades. When you get a surprise like high fuel prices, we need to adjust things like, oh, and so work with operations and the relationships I have throughout the company are positioning me well to help influence our operators to adjust their cost as we need to for customers. Do you feel that reducing costs right now, while also increasing spending, is different than in the past because of the inflationary pressures, because of the energy transition? I would say yes. There are a lot of pressures on the business that we might have had in short spells in the past, but it feels more systemic that we're going to see, you know, inflation for some time, higher commodity prices. With the kind of volatility if someone comes to you and says, hey, Brian, so I need some more money for my division to do this. Are you like the no guy? Or are you able to be really nimble and make sure you can be the yes guy? I would say, I'm the, how can we? Okay. But if we say yes to a request that was emergent, we've got to say no to some other things. So how do we prioritize and make it all work? CEO and former CFO Lynn Good knows how hard this balancing act can be. I think anytime you're trying to balance, you get pulled in various directions. There will be a pull to build more renewables by certain of our stakeholders. There will also be a pull not to go that fast because it could be too expensive. Maybe our industrial customers are worried about price. Full and liberal customers worried about price. So trying to strike that right balance with policy makers, with customers, with investors is a challenge in any moment and there will be a challenge in this one. Take me inside some of the conversation you guys are having in Duke right now. So you and Lynn and other C-suite executives sitting around on table, what do you guys talk about most right now? Supply chain has been a moving target of issues. Last year at this time, we were looking at solar panels and how do we lock in our solar panels that we need for the next several years to ensure we can execute the clean energy transition. It has moved to different components like transformers, which are essential for the grid, interest rates, and the pace at which the Fed is moving interest rates is something we talk about each and every week. And when will that flatten out and how will that impact our business? We are a very large debt issuer, so we watch this extremely closely because it affects our cost structure. Do you want to wait until interest rates level off and then is that delay your capital raising to deploy your plan? We don't wait, but we do plan. There's opportunistic times to issue debt. We will go with larger pieces or versus smaller. And we can work with the length of the debt. If 10-year is price more attractive than 20 or 30, we'll use the tenor to optimize the interest rate. That's all I knew, yeah. Yes. Coming up, Ryan Savoy takes me to the room where it happens. An expert team gathers data and makes decisions that keep dukes renewables running smoothly. They're looking for the smallest change in output because every megawatt hour is money. This is Bloomberg. You will shed light on dark matter. You will make aging on...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,867,2022-11-19 13:10:43

You'll get insight into limitless possibilities, knowledge and inspiration to feed your ambition. So before you invent pioneer, disrupt, before you change the world, Bloomberg. Brian Savoy is taking on a new challenge as he steps into the CFO position at Duke Energy. It's really just his latest challenge. He's touched virtually every area of the company over the last two decades. I started my career at Duke in Houston and our trading business and I was with Deloitte II's before I joined Duke as one of my clients. You know what I saw in Brian was tremendous enthusiasm and energy. He was ready to take on new assignments. He was thinking about advancing the ball for the corporation as opposed to any personal goals. And that came through. He helped us on a number of complex projects and the more we gave them, the more he continued to grow. He had different roles in 10 years. And I've seen different parts of the company from, you know, transformation, leading natural gas and commercial strategy. This has prepared me for the role I have today. What's the advice that you've given him? You know, I've told him a couple of times that you're not going to get a home run at every at bat. There's going to be days where things go wrong. Be patient, be calm. Keep your eye on the ball for the future, the thing you want to get to eventually. You'll have bumps in the road. Fixing things that go wrong and smoothing out bumps in the road is what customers expect from energy providers. And for Duke's renewable assets, that process is overseen from one room in an office building in Charlotte, North Carolina. Ryan's voice showed me around the company's Renewable Control Center. This is where operators are monitoring and managing over 5,000 megawatts of renewables across the United States. How would this differ from like a conventional assets monitoring center? Yeah, so assets historically, they would have the monitoring center on site. So you might have an operator with screens, but at the site, whereas this we can do 90 sites. We can wind, onshore wind, solar, and they're looking for the smallest change in output because every megawatt hour is money. You put an asset in, let's say it's 100 megawatts, right? You expect to get 100 megawatts each and every hour that the resource is there. The resource could be sunshine or it could be wind. And when you get 90 or 80, you're not producing what you can. And it can be because the asset isn't working properly, maybe something hit the turbine blade on the wind farm. Maybe the solar panel has debris on it or it could be the solar intensity is not quite there. When one of these assets isn't producing full capacity, we're putting another resource on it and we're having to toggle this on a consistent basis. And this as clouds come, this is by the minute. This is not, or the hour itself knows by the minute and then it'll fall, come back, and we have assets that follow this digitally as well so that we can keep a consistent flow of electrons on the grid. The operators in this room can respond to incoming data with immediate action, remotely controlling wind turbines, solar panels, and batteries. It's another example of using digital and technology tools to make us more efficient, to make us more productive, minimizing the amount of people we have to have running around and observing and giving us the statistics to really be able to maintain and monitor those facilities. We couldn't see degradation and output as fast as we do now with the technology and the digitalization of the system. Now we still need technicians nearby. And so we use traveling crews that can go, say, sites in Kansas versus sites in South Texas versus Central Texas and across the West. We have around the clock shifts, but about 20 people rotate through these shifts and attack that again.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,868,2022-11-19 13:15:05
18255," Kansas versus sites in South Texas versus Central Texas and across the West. We have around the clock shifts, but about 20 people rotate through these shifts. And again, recovering 90 sites, we got about half a dozen people here at any given time, managing it. You could think that would scale at over time as renewables grow in the United States. So would you say that as you invest more in renewables, it's a hardware thing or a software thing. Like where do you think you're going to spend the most money doing that? Obviously the software will continue to improve over time. And the sensors on the equipment are very important to, again, identify those degradations and output, but it's deploying the hardware, deploying the assets on the ground, getting the sites ready, connecting to the grid is a huge lift. Duke's hardware and software mix keeps evolving and so does its workforce. Retooling also means retraining. We've moved people to the renewable space. We've moved people to cybersecurity, which is a growing area that we need more and more, because as everything gets digitized, there's more opportunities for bad actors to penetrate. So we need high cybersecurity skills and when you match that with operating skills, you really have a beautiful mix that makes a strong, strong operator. Operators here have plenty of micro details to keep track of, but there's a macro factor on their minds as well. That's the weather. We have maps in the United States just to give the operators a bearing of what's going on in the country. And we have plotted on it where our renewable sites are, so they know if there's a weather pattern, weather system coming, I expect that in that area. How do you manage extreme weather? So let's say we have a wind farm in the west and a wind storm is coming. The assets will turn off when the wind speeds exceed a certain level automatically. Okay. Because there's risk of breakage of the blades and damage to people and assets and stuff. We know a wind storm is coming that might damage the solar or a hail storm, for instance, right? We can watch those assets closer, we can put a crew on site, but this team would be dispatching those crews onto the location. And that's where the weather map and the team really works. Yeah, that's right. From hurricanes in the southeast to wildfires in the west, extreme weather events are becoming more prevalent and more intense. Utility companies are bracing for greater risk. When we think about the impacts of extreme weather events on the grid, large grid connecting resources would still, such as large-scale solar farms and large-scale wind farms, would still rely on the centralized grid to deliver electricity to the load centers. So to the extent that the grid is knocked out by a hurricane, those assets would go offline as well. So, in addition to investing in green generation resources, it is extremely important that companies pay attention to grid-hardening measures. We're seeing more frequency of severe events and how we predict those, monitor those and estimate the damage using data analytics and machine learning to say, how many customers might be out of this happens, what generators are at risk, and all that modeling goes into our planning for. What would put our investments? We talked about the capital plan earlier. All those investments are informed by the climate trends that we see across our system. Coming up, Duke's Clean Energy plans get a major boost from DC with the Inflation Reduction Act. Brian Savoy is already working through the possibilities. For example, 1,000 megawatts of solar equates to about 60 million in annual production tax credits. This is Bloomberg. It's a really a reminder, isn't it, just how sensitive the markets are to any commentary about trade. We did see pressure on the U.N., we did see pressure on the future. That is now being reversed. The peak is crucially important and I think we've moved from this attitude from its indulgence a waste of time, almost an illness that needs a cure. For something as universally important to human life as sleep, mysteries surrounding its necessity and utility have only just been recently uncovered. Some of our biggest discoveries were in the 1970s or 1980s and so it makes that a really exciting field because it seems as though we're uncovering new insights each and every day. Some scientists are going further to find out how sleep and what happens there can be harness to further expand our understanding.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,869,2022-11-19 13:19:17

Some scientists are going further to find out how sleep and what happens there can be harness to further expand our understanding. It's easy to memorize things that makes you smart if you can spit back a lot of facts. But if you want to be wise, if you really want wisdom, you've got to know when and how and why to use that information. And that's what you bring, figures out what you're sleeping. Japan's critical role in the global economy is changing as the world recalibrates. After decades of stagnation, Japan's leaders are forging a more innovative and sustainable path forward to revitalize the nation.

The writings on the wall for the Bank of England just a oil has spray painted the front door. Recessioning in Europe, UK and possibly the US. We will be able to get our out in full force celebrating the election victory of former President Blula. With unmatched reach in resources from more than 120 countries, the moment news breaks 24 hours a day. Bloomberg, your global business authority. The next decade for Duke Energy is pretty clearly mapped out. Raise and spend $145 billion on a massive clean energy transition. Put the bulk of those investments into regulated businesses while investigating the sale of non-core assets to fund that push. It'll all be up to new CFO, Brian Savoy to execute this plan and make sure it delivers optimal financial growth. The motion is adopted. Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act in August, putting provisions in place that make his task more manageable. The Inflation Reduction Act provides incentives for renewables. It provides incentives for battery storage and it provides incentives for nuclear. All of those incentives for a regulated company go right to our customers. They reduce directly the price of our product. So when I build a renewable product, it's going to cost me less and it'll cost my customers less. It's going to help our renewable transition. For example, 1,000 megawatts of solar equates to about 60 million in annual production tax credits. We're going to have 30,000 megawatts of renewables on our system by 2035. The Inflation Reduction Act has been a very important piece of legislation. It's not only that it creates a number of incentives for a variety of assets, right? It also is very durable in long term. So instead of a patchwork of different tax credits that we've seen in the past, it actually creates a light path going well into 2030s for this long-term transition on the grid. Political winds may shift and regulations are always subject to change. For the moment, policy in Washington aligns with Duke's strategic goals. What's like there's a parallel partnership now? We have a voice at the table. I have a lot of conversations with the Treasury Department about tax policy. As they define the rules around the IRA, they will seek input from people like us. We will weigh in. This is what you should think about as you write the detailed rules to implement this act. When it comes to relationship between utility and policy makers and regulators, those have always been extremely important. Those utilities that cultivate have cultivated those relationships in a constructive fashion, where they've been good stewards of capital and operate the system well and took into consideration interest of various stakeholders in addition to the equity and debt investors, of course. Those that you enjoy, congratulations to the regulators in our experience, right? And that over time translates into constructive rate outcomes and better recovery mechanism. Recovery mechanisms are set at the state level. They also help companies and customers absorb the capital costs of the clean energy transition. We cannot adjust our price without working through regulators. And modern recovery mechanisms allow us to adjust price more frequently and align with our investments so that when the investments...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,870,2022-11-19 13:23:40
18257," through regulators. And modern recovery mechanisms allow us to adjust price more frequently and align with our investments. So that when the investments start causing expenses, revenues follow. And there's alignment. Otherwise, we call it regulatory lag where you have expenses before we can earn revenues on those assets. Historically, we would build up investments, then have what's called a rate case and have a large increase in one one slug. The modern recovery mechanisms place assets and service each year essentially. So your smoothing rate increases over time. So customers can plan better and we can plan better. Even with meticulous planning and regulatory tailwinds, US utilities must proceed with caution. Europe's energy crisis highlights the fight between green energy and energy security, raising questions about how fast and hard the world can pivot. There's been criticisms say in Europe that they were trying to go too fast into renewables, for example. And therefore they left out nuclear and they sort of shuttered coal plants and now they're paying the price in that respect. What's the right pace? I think the pace is maintaining balance with a reliability and affordability. That's the only way we know to to gauge pace. We will not put a plan together, then we don't have a high degree of confidence. We can serve our customers every hour, every season. And we have to keep an eye on affordability. We call it a responsible balance transition. The transition away from fossil fuels is coming. I mean, just think about coal. Five years ago you could get as much coal as you want. Now coal's constrained and it's going to become even more constrained. So operating coal assets is not even going to be an option as we move through time. So the convergence of energy independence and security I believe is coming soon. That's the state of play for Brian Savoy, as he starts his tenure as Duke's CFO. I asked him what he sees when he looks ahead. What is the biggest opportunity over the next 10 years as CFO that you're most excited about? Over the next decade, I feel like utilities have a moment to really make a mark on society. And again, it's long lasting, it's going to be for our grandkids and their grandkids. So putting the utility sector in prominence of the world, that's what I want to do. What's the biggest challenge? What are you most worried about in the next 10 years in doing your job? I think the biggest challenge is balancing investment, the investments we need to make and the transition in front of us with the cost to customers. Because the oversight by regulators is only getting more and more and more. And we've got to be more clear on the customer benefits of every dollar we spend that turns into value for customers. And I can see this playing out in just hand-to-hand combat over the next decade and we will work it. And we believe the investments we're making will meet that bar. What is the skill that you have as CFO that you think will help that? I'm worried for value. I don't like waste at all. And when I see the things that we need to change, I have the courage to make it happen. And as CFO, I'm in a position to really move that and Duke. And what's a new skill set of knowledge that you're excited about over the next 10 years? I would say the new skill set would be how to balance all of the external views of the company with the internal. I've worked inside this company and have great influence. But ensuring that similar level of influence is out in the external world. What's the best advice you've received coming into CFO? You know, I will go back many years ago, over 10 years ago, I was working for Lynn. And she told me, Brian, the skills you have positioned you for a wide range of roles. I had no idea what that meant. Then this was like 2009.

18258," Bloomberg. So, as you look back on your career, what would you say is the best investment advice you've ever received? Probably the best investment advice that I never received but that I've lived my whole life around is surround yourself with really good people. I thought about it just today like I do many times, you know, what makes a great investor. A great investment firm is comprised of people who are optimists and pessimists and realists because in the intersection of the debates that go across that wide range of personalities is where you find truth. It's part of the reason I'm so focused on freedom of expression. I see it my own four walls, the robust and fulsome debates around how we commit our capital, what defines a good idea, what businesses to build or pursue. That's what drives the success at Citadel. I've been very fortunate in life to have always had a group of friends who really push me, who make me better. And here I get to work with three and a half thousand colleagues who in their ways make me better each and every day and collectively as a team, we've had the opportunity to have an incredible impact on the financial landscape around the world. We will never break, we will never break, build on a foundation strong enough to stay. We will never break, have a wide array of issues and the mountains shake, all of who remain, we will never, no, no, no.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,872,2022-11-19 13:32:27
18259," The crisis gets worse. Over the next 30 minutes, we talk strategy, investment banking in Europe, the future of the city of London, and how inflation will change the banking world, with the man who's in charge of barclays for the last 12 months. Bank cat, thank you so much for speaking to Bloomberg. So 12 months into the job, what have you learned about yourself and the bank? The last 12 months have been a wonderfully educational experience. About myself, I've learned how much more I needed to learn about banking, including running a large organization, finding ways to encapsulate what our ambitions are, and to convey and get to so many people, and then visiting all this beautiful footprint of the bank we have. It's also been a wonderful year in terms of the bank's operational performance. We've managed a bunch of crises and we've managed them relatively well, I think. But it's the start. We are in a middle of a tough economic environment. So in terms of strategy, the strategy hasn't changed that much from your predecessor. Is it about execution, or is it a different lens that you're looking at it with? So I was part of the team that set up the strategy seven years ago. And our strategy then was to simplify our footprint, focus on building a global investment bank that was very highly competitive. We are now number six, we have the biggest European investment bank. It was about doubling down in the UK where we want to be a leading financial institution in sort of everything, retail and wholesale. And it is about building up a very specialized consumer business in the US, which we've done. We like the footprint, the businesses are operating well. I think now it is the striving to excellence, which is to make sure that in all the businesses which we do, clients and customers know what we are about, we do the things that we do very well. We don't have hobbies, we are very focused, we execute well and it's about excellence. But can you really compete with the US bank in terms of having an investment bank? Can Europe have that leverage or are you always going to be one step below? So we are competing. We are number six. We've been gaining market share and share revenue share in our markets business for many years. And we are under no illusion that we're not going to catapult, nor do we want to catapult the number three or number two. But we can be very good at what we do. And if we are good people will transact with us and work with us. And you can make a very good living at the size we are. Do you want to get bigger? If you look at the pipelines and things that are coming through, it was now the right time to employ more bankers. Two slightly different questions about getting bigger. One is I think that as long as we do well and organically we grow, that's fine. I wouldn't want to take large steps. But if it happens in an accumulation over a period of time, that's welcome because it's gradual. About bankers, I think it's a question more about what sectors of banking. We've made a big push in sustainability and we continue to expect to do that. And obviously pulling out of some old economy sectors, reducing it not to zero. But there is a shift in the banking wallet and we respond to that. And I think sustainability is very important. Are you expecting more IPOs, more pipelines? You mentioned the environment that's a little bit uncertain at the moment. What does the next 12 months look like? I think it is going to be a difficult environment for the first six to nine months of that 12. I hope by the summer when people are able to sort of see the end of the rate rising cycle, it may not have happened by the summer but hopefully you can forecast the end of it with reasonable confidence, then businesses will feel more confident themselves in what they want to do about their capital raising and capital planning. But I think it'll take a little time before we see that clarity. What's your biggest concern out there on the markets? I know you had some good results. A lot of it has to do with also how you traded, your traders perform very well. But we have a very uncertain environment. We don't know what inflation looks like, the cost of living, you have exposure to mortgage. There's leverage out there. What keeps you up at night? Well, I think what we've had this year is a series of incidents which would have been difficult to forecast at the start of the year. Even at the start of the year, I think across the industry, people work.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,873,2022-11-19 13:36:39
18260," Had this year is a series of incidents which would have been difficult to forecast at the start of the year. Even at the start of the year, I think across the industry people were cautious because they knew we were at the start of a raiding cycle. It's never good for credit assets in those periods. It's not good for equity assets generally in that period. Then you had the Russia Ukraine war and then here in the UK you had that little volatility with GELTS and LDI. There are pockets where there could be leverage and there are pockets where there may be rapid movements. In this kind of a raiding cycle you would expect to see that happen. Rather than being specific worries about certain things, it's generally aware that you're driving a car when it's raining and the roads may be slippery. What does that mean in terms of risk management? What does that mean in terms of you preempting some of the things that could go on? We have been operating through the year with relatively less risk and what I would call relatively less long biased risk, meaning expectations of asset prices to rise. Then we would normally have done or had done a year or two ago. So in the language of traders we manage from a defensive position. Which means that things could still go wrong in unexpected ways or that you feel confident that you have this. You live through the financial crisis. Every two weeks somebody says this is going to be worse than a financial crisis. This is worse than 70s. What kind of crisis are we going to see and what does it mean for the banks? First of all, I don't think as far as the banking system goes this will be worse than the financial crisis. I think banks are much better capitalized but much better risk managed and much more aware of the importance of doing that than they were back then. The regulators are also much more intimately involved and engaged with the banks in understanding bank exposures. I think it's not going to be like that. I think from our point of view and speaking for Barclays, what we have to worry about is the impact on consumers. We are starting at a point where people have strong balance sheets and employment is very high. These are very good initial conditions but squeezes are coming in different ways. In the UK, to a greater degree than the US, you've got the energy price squeeze. Also in the UK, to a greater degree than in the US, you've got a squeeze coming from higher interest rates and mortgage prices and rents. Because it's more of a variable rate market. It's more of a fixed market than it used to be. But it's more variable than the US is which has a 15 or 30 of fixed market. But you're not seeing that right in consumer spending right now. You're not seeing it in mortgages either. Is there worry that we're complacent and then at some point, next year or early next year, it hits us hard. Not that we are complacent but even though we've started off in a good condition, there are factors that are eroding that strength of the consumer balance sheet. What I'm hoping you see is what people will call a soft landing and a shallow recession. Helped by the initial conditions. And so what you might see is an increase in unemployment. You might see some credit weakness among customers. But it won't be so bad that you see distress in society. However, it has to be managed carefully and it has to be managed aggressively with the balancing of the budget. And that's what the Prime Minister has said in the last couple of days. A lot of the satellites have propulsion systems they can kind of move to get out of the way of each other or change their orbit a little bit. It's a service that you guys offer to help these companies know how to maneuver their machines. Yeah, we offer a collision avoidance service. It's a subscription service. We'll send you an alert up to seven days in advance if your satellite is going to come dangerously close to a piece of debris or another satellite. And so, you know, the companies have been doing that for decades moving satellites around, but it's sort of like a harder problem now. The risk of a collision is a lot higher now. Just because we've installed so much more hardware into space. You have a big collision that creates a cloud of debris. And now all the other satellites are flying through this whizzing mess of debris. As we add all of the new satellites into space, the risks of the collision, the likelihood of the collisions going up.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,874,2022-11-19 13:40:57

I'm going to talk to you a little bit about the last six weeks. You mentioned the guilt. Was there a moment where you were in the office thinking like, as Barclays, you're one of the players in selling and buying guilds with the margin calls coming in and saying, that the volatility was managed extremely well by the very effective, targeted, and time-bound actions of the Bank of England. So I think buying guilds, buying inflation linked guilds, and then the repo facility that they put in working with the banking system all helped ease the pressure in the crisis. And you've got 10-year guild heels now back below where they were at the day of the mini budget on the 23rd of September. As for us, we are large in the guilds market. What was important for us, as we saw it, was this was not a solvency issue at all for the pension system. It was a liquidity issue. And it was a liquidity issue because what was a very important feature of the UK pension system, which by the way, I think is a good feature of the pension system, which is a matching of assets and liabilities, which employed leverage, created a liquidity problem. So a liquidity problem had to be managed. And the liquidity problem was managed by the government intervention or the Bank of England intervention, the repo facility, which allows people to borrow against assets rather than sell them and by slowly releasing the pressure. And so far, so good. Do you think that will change actually, where you're liations around new pensions in the UK? So I don't know the answer, but I think what is important is that the UK pension system in aggregate is very well funded. It's about a 125-130% funded ratio, which is extraordinarily good, which gives it a good starting point from which to manage to a less leveraged future. Is liquidity your biggest concern for banks right now? I mean, we're again hearing the US Treasury Secretary having to do things, maybe to put a bit of extra liquidity or to pad it out in the Treasury market. Bank liquidity, I don't think, is an issue. We've had liquidity regimes. The funding models are much, much more robust than they were in the financial crisis. I think part of what people are worried about and what they saw in the guilt market was the liquidity in underlying trading, which is that these markets are not deep with smaller bid-offers in large sizes of trades as they used to be 15 years ago. And I think part of it, our banks are more prudent in managing their risk. So that's a good thing. It's a good thing, but it has a consequence that the big providers of liquidity have moved away from the banking system to the buy side. Do you worry about shadow banking? And is there any crossover? If you look at the system as a whole, if there's something wrong with shadow banking, does it impact the big banks? So it impacts the big banks. And by shadow banking, I'll narrow it to, let's call FinTech companies. So it impacts the banks in a good way and a bad way. So in a good way, what they've done is they've provided digital technology ways of giving services to customers, which customers like. And it's made us up our game. And faster than we would have otherwise. And shame on us for not having done it earlier. Now, when they go into credit, which some of them have done, they have less regulation than we do, which is perhaps not good for customers who deal with them.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,875,2022-11-19 13:45:29
18262," And they go into credit, which some of them have done. They have less regulation than we do, which is perhaps not good for customers who deal with them, who may not get the protections they do if they deal with us. And perhaps not good for them if they don't lend with quite the rigor and standards that more established companies might. On the second issue, that's a supposition, let's see. What's your relationship like with the new UK government? Have you had calls? Have they given you assurance about windfall taxes? Well, I think the government is brand new. So we obviously, many of the faces are very familiar faces. And we've been in communication with them in many years. And we always are with the government. And we are way to see their proposals on taxation, on fiscal policy, on all aspects of it. Where do you see the city of London being in four or five years? I mean, that's maybe too long a time frame. Should I say 12 months? Well, it's both too long and too short. Here we are in the city. And this city has been the center of finance for 300 years. And it needs to be the center of finance for 300 more years. We certainly would wish that that were the case. And it is the center of finance because of an excellent regulatory system, transparent, fair. It is there because of great availability of talent and infrastructure, soft financial infrastructure, and hard financial infrastructure. And a part of that is also a stable, predictable taxation regime. So we hope that all those elements and ingredients remain and continue to allow the city to flourish. And the Prime Minister spoke about investing in education in Britain. And if you think about what drives the financial sector, I mean, you meet many of them. It's about the wonderfully trained people in the UK, and the wonderfully trained people outside for able to come and work in the UK. If the UK has lost something, if the city of London has lost business to other parts of the world in terms of financial capitals, what do you need from the government today for that to be reversed? Well, some of it is what others do. So once Brexit happened, and you could not pass vote financial services to London, all the major banks had to set up trading enterprises in Europe. So that is irreversible, let's say, for the time being. I think other than that, what we need is a continuation of what London has provided. Education, infrastructure, people, great regulatory regime, and a stable and predictable fiscal regime. Until not too long ago, Barclays had an activist shareholder on its back. Do you think about that? You always have to think about it. I don't think about it from the point of view of our business mix. I do think we have a good business mix. And that activist shareholder came because he thought we should sell our investment bank. He could not have been more wrong. I repeated, he could not have been more wrong. The investment bank has been what has kept Barclays flourishing and quite apart from many of our competitors. In the fact that we performed extremely well during COVID, we are able to have a more diversified business model. But I think for many banks, like us, where our valuations are low, you've always got to be worried about what is driving bank valuations. Companies now, they're getting hundreds, maybe even thousands of applications. So software has come in to automate the process. You want to write your resume for robots, not for humans.

Nobody covers jobs day like Bloomberg. Is Europe over banked? Europe is against separate Europe from the UK. I don't think the UK is overbanked. I think part of what drives bank valuations, especially in Europe versus the US, is there is some worry about business model. I think in our case we've got the right business model and what will drive our valuation is solid performance, excellent performance, as I say, repeated excellent performance. I think in Europe banking is still fairly nationalized, not nationalized and state-owned but by country. And I think we have to see at some point the experiment of one large European bank crossing borders in a meaningful way and then we'll know. When do you think that will happen? Or is it just a dream? We've been talking about it. I feel like for two decades. Yeah, I mean it's a question more for the European bank CEOs. I think it should happen. I think the test case should happen and now is a good time. When you go through a period like this, there will be some banks which will benefit from consolidation and ownership by a larger entity. And I hope I see it happen and it'll be good for Europe. Your bank is doing pretty well. Others are doing less well. We talk about Credit Suisse almost day and day out. Have you been able to get some business from clients that no longer want to bank with them? Well, business goes or everywhere in the banking industry. Obviously, where Credit Suisse has pulled out of certain businesses such as the prime business, we got some business from their clients. But look, they announced a big restructuring. We wish them well. It is important for the banking system for there to be many players who are strong. And I think with this restructuring, hopefully Credit Suisse is on a good upward trend and regains the prominence it used to have. Ben, get to talk to me about some of the human errors, right? The recession that we've been talking about and how much that cost you. I know that there was also, I don't know if it's punishments coming or some, you know, a step towards the people that did those mistakes. Where are we on that? So we had an over issuance of securities in the US. It was completely avoidable. It is one of these embarrassing moments you hate to have when you see Europe a bank. It is, however, it was a human error in a very narrow way. We have done both and had an external investigation on it and internal investigation. We have made good by all the clients affected. We have had a settlement with the SEC. We cooperated from the first minute fully with all our regulators. And we dealt with the matter internally. We are in the final stages now where individuals who were affected or involved in this are being assessed. We've got a standard process by which we do that. And yes, there will be, you know, implications for certain individuals, but that process will play itself. I mean, through your strategy, we talked a little bit about, you know, the global economy. Do you worry that this wave of inflation is just going to get worse? When will we reach peak inflation? When will we know that we've reached peak inflation? You will know that the rate of change of inflation is stabilizing when the central banks start signaling it that in their rate rises, going away from 75 basis points, 100 basis points to something more normal and natural. Now, mathematically, there will be some forces that will bring inflation down.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,877,2022-11-19 13:53:58
18264," From 75 basis points, 100 basis points to something more normal and natural. Now mathematically there will be some forces that will bring inflation down, just because base effects as they call them. And I expect that will happen sometime in the middle of next year. Is there danger that central banks messes up, that they raise interest rates too much? Look, there's always a finely calibrated issue about when do you stop? And I think many people have sort of raised two worries. One is that there's a sort of supply chain led element of this. There's an energy shock element of this. Employment is at all time highs, relatively speaking. And that people have not seen such a hiking cycle in three decades. Having said that, I think the officials are all across the world are all very, very experienced. And I think they'll find the right way to calibrate it. How difficult is it in this uncertain environment, frankly, to calibrate where you want to grow businesses geographically in the world? Well, I'll speak for Barclays. We've got a real strength of the business in the US and the UK. We've got a good investment bank in Europe and a trading business. We're headquartered in Ireland, but got a large trading presence in France. And then good presence in Asia, both in the Middle East and India. We've got an excellent investment banking franchise and Singapore and Hong Kong. I expect that footprint to remain broadly as it is. We have some very interesting partnerships in Australia. We might do some others. But I expect the broad footprint to be as it is. The geopolitical complexities, which are also rising, makes people more cautious also about which countries they want to go to. Have you had to increase wages? I'm not really thinking of the high-flyer bankers, but just to match inflation in most of these places. Yeah, so we did a fairly large program of wage rises in India, where we've got a large number of employees last year in 2021. In the UK, we did an interim adjustment in August of about 4% for a lot of our workers. And then we are working through another one for the end of this year. And we did one in the US also late last year. So I think inflation, especially as it affects some of our workers, we're going to have to look at it and we're going to have to respond. When you look at the return to the office, I think you, bankers have to be back four days a week. Yeah. How's that going? It's going well. Look, I think we always have to create a balance. There's a level of flexibility that's come into work life into the workplace since COVID, which I think is good. I think some of the stigma attached to working from home has gone away. And I think that's really important, especially for those who are managing young families or have other pressures that require them to spend more time at home or close to home. And I think we should continue that and should continue that in important ways. Some jobs require you to be in the office. Our trading flows are largely full five days a week and that's the way it should be. Our bank branches here in London also need to be stuffed and they should be. And for some other functions, it can be less, but I do think it's important for people in all functions at all levels to be in the office. This isn't a apprenticeship business at the end of the day. And it's important to have that productivity from being face to face. When you look at the strength and dollar, this could be a shorter term. It could last for a very long time if you'll get King Dollar. What does it mean for Berkley's? As a financial matter, it's actually good. We have about 40% of our revenues in dollars. We've got a fairly big business in the US. More broadly though, I mean world economies will have to adjust. And that adjustment process can be painful. And you can see the pain it's inflicting in Europe and the UK. Expôt will be subsidized, but import prices go up. Vanca, thank you so much.

So let me get right to the heart of Ukraine if I get asked you. Is there any chance of a resolution in Ukraine matter any time the foreseeable future, any possibility of a truce or some kind of agreement?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,879,2022-11-19 14:02:37
18266," The heart of Ukraine, if I could ask you, is there any chance of a resolution in Ukraine matter any time in the foreseeable future, any possibility of a truce or some kind of agreement that you think could end this war in the next few months or so? You never say never. There's always a chance. And we've been clear from the beginning that we would support a diplomatic solution that vindicated Ukraine's right to sovereignty and territorial integrity. But the odds have been in the next few months, I think are quite low. On China, the President of the United States has not met with Xi Jinping for COVID-related reasons. But there isn't possibility. They might meet in the upcoming G20 meeting. Do you have any plans to have a agreement or any kind of proposed settlements of any issues that are now ongoing between the two countries? Or is it just more or less a meet and greet with no advanced planning of any great consequence? Well, right now there's no meeting planned. But as you say, they will both be in Bali, Indonesia, for the G20 in November. And it would afford an opportunity for the two of them to sit down in person. Actually, despite the fact that they've spent a huge amount of time together when Joe Biden was Vice President, they've not met in person since President Biden became president. And that's because Xi Jinping is basically not left China in two years due to COVID-19. So this would be their first real chance to sit face to face and talk through the full range of issues in the relationship. I wouldn't expect major agreements to come out of that. But if they do actually sit, and again, that hasn't been decided, I would expect that we would see some progress on some issues where the two countries' interests do align. As we talk today, it's coming out that President Putin will be meeting with President Xi Jinping most likely somewhere in Europe. I'm not too long from now. Was that a surprise to you? And what do you think they're going to be talking about? Well, it's not a surprise. President Xi and President Putin have met frequently over the course of each of their tenure. And in fact, President Putin went to Beijing earlier this year and met in person with President Xi in February when they rolled out this new partnership between the two countries. So I think that they'll talk about the full range of issues in their relationship. But I would note two things. First, before President Xi goes to Uzbekistan to meet with President Putin on the sidelines of another summit, he's going to Kazakhstan. And Kazakhstan's a place where actually China and Russia compete for influence. So it's an indication that this is a relationship not without its complications. And then second, China has actually stood back from fully getting in behind the Russians when it comes to their war in Ukraine. We have not seen them provide large-scale support in terms of weapons or industrial-scale efforts to undermine Western sanctions. So from our perspective, this relationship is something that bears close watching. But again, is not without its complications. As we talk, there's also reports that North Korea is selling weapons to Russia. Was that a surprise to the administration? Well, what it indicates, actually, is that Russia doesn't have a lot of options. It appears to be running short of its own munitions. It looks around the world and doesn't find a lot of countries willing to sell it munitions. So it has to look to states like Iran and North Korea to get ammunition and other forms of weaponry to be able to sustain its conflict in Ukraine. This is not, in our view, a demonstration of strength by Russia. Now, the negotiation with Iran to restore, if that's the right verb, the nuclear agreement is ongoing. It's been ongoing for quite some time. Do you see any resolution of that in the near future? And not in the coming days. The Iranians have come back with a set of counter proposals, which we are still taking a look at. But it doesn't suggest that an agreement is imminent right away. That being said, we do believe that there still is a pathway to a compliance for compliance return to the JCPOA. We will continue to work on that with our partners, particularly our European partners. And if Iran is prepared to do its part to get back into the JCPOA, we stand ready to do so. And as we talk, the new Prime Minister of UK has been announced, previously involved in foreign policy. Have you met her before? I have met her before. I've met her here in the White House, right down the hall from where we are right now when she was foreign secretary.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,880,2022-11-19 14:07:05
18267," foreign policy. Have you met her before? I have met her before. I've met her here in the White House right down the hall from where we are right now when she was foreign secretary. She's transitioned from being essentially their secretary of state to being their prime minister. And actually just yesterday President Biden had the opportunity to have a long phone call with her just hours after she had assumed her new position. And do you expect any change in the U.K. U.S. policy as a result of her becoming prime minister? At a foundational level, no. You know, this is a special relationship. The two of them reaffirmed their commitment to the strength and vitality of the U.S. U.K. alliance. And I think on all of the major issues, whether it's Russia or China or Iran, you'll see the same kind of deep consultation and engagement between the two countries that you've seen before, regardless of who's president, regardless of who's prime minister. So I don't expect that there will be any fundamental changes in the relationship. But you know, there'll be issues that we have to work through, of course, as there always are. Now, as we talk, the UN General Assembly will be meeting not too long from now in New York as it does every year. Do you think the UN has still a useful purpose in diplomacy? Because it doesn't seem to be able to solve any problems ongoing war problems that we now see in U.S. Ukraine or Russia. What do you think is the UN's main purpose at this point? Well, the UN actually has proved its continued effectiveness in actually being able to bring about diplomatic agreements in very difficult circumstances. I'll give you just two examples from the past few months. First, on Russia, Ukraine, it was the UN Secretary-General Antonio Gutarraish, who played a central role in getting a deal between Russia and Ukraine for the export of grain from both Ukrainian ports and Russian ports in the Black Sea. That's helping the entire world with respect to lowering food prices and expanding access to foodstuffs at a critical moment. Second, it was a UN mediator working with our U.S. envoy, the Saudis, Emirates, and the Yemenis, who helped produce earlier this year a ceasefire in the war in Yemen, which had been the worst humanitarian catastrophe in the world. That ceasefire is now going on six months, the longest period of peace in seven years in Yemen, and the UN played a key role in that. So it is not without its difficulties and complications. It is a big bureaucracy in need of constant reform, but the UN is still there on key issues in diplomacy, in delivering on global health, global food security, and other issues. And all of that will be on display in New York in two weeks. Now recently, the President made a major speech on democracy. While the threat to American democracy is real, I want to say as clearly as we can, we are not powerless in the face of these threats. And in it, he talked about the values of democracy, which is large part of our foreign policy, which is to promote democracy around the world. Our events in the United States are the last year of so making it more difficult for the U.S. to say to other countries, look at how wonderful our democracy has worked, and therefore you should be following some of the things we do. Well, it does require a degree of humility. I mean, the United States does need to acknowledge that we have our own difficulties and challenges within our own democracy, even as we tout and promote democratic institutions, rule of law, human rights around the world. But I think President Biden is actually a very good messenger for that. Someone who can speak honestly and clearly to the American people about the strains in our democracy, and then someone who can speak honestly and clearly to the world about how despite all of its imperfections, democracy remains the best form of government for delivering, for citizens, and for promoting human dignity. Hydrogen has a very special place in the universe. It's the first element on the periodic table. It is the most abandoned element in the universe, and when clean energy advocates think about what can we find, which would be as easy to use as fossil fuels, they think about hydrogen. The fuel that will wind burn only produced water.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,881,2022-11-19 14:11:20
18268," It would be as easy to use as fossil fuels they think about hydrogen. The fuel that will when burn only produce water. We like to imagine that if we just built enough of these and these, we could ditch fossil fuels and save the planet. Unfortunately, it's not that simple. There are some things we just need a good old-fashioned combustible fuel. We now start off around the world of betting that hydrogen can become the fuel of the 21st century. Let's talk a moment about your own background. You are not generally out there promoting your background. It's quite impressive and I just want to let people know about it a bit. You grew up in Minnesota. And I guess you were a superstar in elementary school, junior high school, junior high school, your president of your class, president of student government. Is there anything you failed to do in high school that you wanted to do? Well, I didn't win all the cross-country races that I wanted to win, I guess. But you went to Yale. Yeah. And Yale, you must have done reasonably well. You were elected as a road scholar. And from Oxford, you later came back and went to Yale Law School. And you were a top-editor there and became a Supreme Court clerk for Justice Breyer. So, when you're having this career, do you ever think that you could make a mistake or your career could kind of go off the deep end or something because everything was working out perfectly? Well, it's true that I have had these incredible opportunities. But at every one of those stages, I went through the same fears and growing pains and slip ups and stumbles that everybody did. And that was true with respect to academic work that was far from perfect. It was true with respect to relationships that didn't work out. And you know, I had what I think was an incredibly lucky childhood in upbringing. But one that was not too different from the way a lot of other people who grew up in the Midwest in the 1980s and then got to have these chances. They were a father and mother, what could they do? So my father worked on the business side of Minneapolis' start Tribune, which was the major newspaper in Minneapolis. My mother was a teacher and a guidance counselor in the Minneapolis Public Schools. And I'm one of five. I'm the second of five kids. And we all went to the Minneapolis Public Schools, graduated from Southwest High School. And your siblings, they say, look, you're too good. You're a Rhodes Scholar. You're a yellow-alternal. And everything, or there's no sibling rivalries. I mean, actually, I would say my sister is probably the most impressive among us. She's a pediatrician. She was a two-sport division one athlete. And she's got five kids and is currently working at the Department of Health and Human Services on COVID-19 and other pandemic responses. So I'm like kind of middle of the pack in terms of my siblings. There was another person who was a Rhodes Scholar, went to Yale Law School, who became President of the United States, Bill Clinton. So have you ever thought of running for office yourself? I used to think about it. But honestly, over the course of the years, I think my skills are better suited to public service and a not-elected format. And I'd rather help other people who I think would be better suited for actually running for office themselves. Talk for a moment about what it's like to be the National Security Advisor. The National Security Advisor Office was set up, I think, in the Eisenhower administration, more or less, though President Truman had a National Security Advisor as well. Your job is to get in early every day, make sure there's no crisis or there is a crisis to tell the President. Are you seeing the President early in the morning and briefing him? Is that what you do as many have done before? Yes, so in the morning we have something called the President's Daily Brief. That takes place in the Oval Office. And it's myself, my two deputies, and then the Director of National Intelligence, who are there every day. And then we also bring in other cabinet members, depending on what the subjects are being briefed, so that the President gets exposure to his full national security team over the course of the week. And we talked to him about...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,882,2022-11-19 14:15:40
18269," what the subjects are being briefed so that he gets, the president gets exposure to his full national security team over the course of the week. And we talked to him about things that have developed overnight around the world. And we also talked to him about longer-term trends that he expresses interest in and wants to stay on top of. So it's a mix of both the immediate term and the long term. And it gives him a full picture of the challenges and opportunities in the world for American 4K. And in a typical day, do you see him a couple other times? And do you see him at the end of the day as well? Well, just to take yesterday as an example, in addition to the PDB Secretary Blinken and I had the opportunity to just sit with him informally for a little while before the cabinet meeting. So we could talk through a kind of tick list of issues that had been building up over the course the last couple of weeks. And then later in the afternoon, we had this call with the British Prime Minister. And that involved some amount of time to talk through what he wanted to accomplish in that phone call, what we expected. She would say to him. And then I sat there with him while he did the phone call. So that would be a typical day, seeing the President two, three times. And then spending time with the other principles of the National Security Council, the cabinet secretary, Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of State, and talking through the big decisions that we would need to tee up for the President to make on everything from global food security to Taiwan to the Chips Act, the new law that's been passed to invest in advanced microchips here in the United States. We covered the waterfront. So sometimes, presidents, I observed, lose their temper and they yell. His President Biden, that yell, everyone needs to not have me or he just calmly just says, here's what I think. He's not a yell. And he's somebody who is disciplined and direct and holds us to a high standard. And he will challenge us to make sure that we have nailed down the details of everything we are presenting to him. And if we haven't, he'll tell us, do better. But he does so in a totally respectful, straightforward way, the same way that everybody has seen him in public life. So when I work in the White House under President Carter, there were frequent disputes between the Secretary of State, side-vants, and the National Security Adviser as a big brazen ski. And it's a great tradition, it seems, in our government, that the Secretary of State, the National Security Adviser, are always sparring one where they are leaking to the press. In this administration, I haven't seen a lot of leaks from your office or the Secretary's office criticizing the other person's office. So how have you avoided that problem? Well, a lot of it has to do with just deep mutual respect and straight-up friendship between myself and the Secretary of State. Tony and I have known each other for years. We're good friends, our families are friends. That doesn't mean that there aren't debates. We don't have disputes because we have an open, operating style. I think we both try to be nice people. But we do have debates. We disagree on certain issues. And the thing that I take very seriously is my responsibility to run a process that is open, humane, fair, transparent, and above board. And I try to do that so that his issue are all teed up to the President in a way in which they get their say. And then we work it out. And that has, in my view, worked quite effectively over the course of the past 19 months. And I consider it one of the central responsibilities of my position to ensure that that process is fair and effective. In hindsight, which is always 2020, is there anything the administration could have done to prevent Putin from invading? Six months into this invasion, I'm fairly well convinced that Putin was going to do this no matter what. While Tesla's in the like make for good headlines, the reality is that even if every car on the roads today went electric, it wouldn't be enough to curb global emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change. greenhouse gas emissions from transportation account for about 29% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. So what about the other 71%? Building across America burned fossil fuels to operate. What we want to do is make that all electric. Instead of burning oil and gas to give us the",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,883,2022-11-19 14:20:03
18270," 31% building to cross America burn fossil fuels to operate. What we want to do is make that all electric. Instead of burning oil and gas to give us the energy and electricity we need, we want to do 100% clean energy, all electric. We want to turn buildings into Tesla's. Just like a Tesla or an electric vehicle is all electric with no fossil fuels, we want to do that with our buildings. And if we can do it in one building, we can do it in all buildings. And if we do it in all buildings, we'll reduce 30% of US greenhouse gas emissions. Hey, so you've got to explain this one to me. What does it mean when the White House says we're watching markets carefully? It means they have a Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. They have. I've been in and seen it. Lots of Bloombergs. Lots of Bloombergs. Lots of Bloombergs. Lots of Bloombergs. Lots of Bloomberg. Lots of Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. What does it mean? What does it mean? What does it mean? What does it mean? It means they have a Bloomberg. We will never break. We will never break. Build on a foundation strong enough to stay. We will never. I think that it's hard to put your head around any narrative. Like to be honest, we've had sort of a shift in our we in some sort of circulation fears moment. People were talking about that all day yesterday. Let's go around the world for a couple of trouble spots. North Korea, any progress on getting them to give up their nuclear testing? Or is that difficult to do? It's difficult, obviously, through multiple presidents going back to the Clinton administration. The North Koreans have continued to move forward with their nuclear weapons program. In the course of the past year, they have conducted a number of long-range missile tests. We have been warning about the possibility of a seventh nuclear test, test of a nuclear weapon. And we still think that that is something that is likely to happen in the coming months. We have also indicated to the North Koreans that we are prepared to sit down in a serious way to conduct diplomacy, to on a step-by-step basis, work towards the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. So far, the North Koreans have been so much of interest in that. China and Taiwan. There's been a lot of rhetoric from the U.S. side and a lot of rhetoric from the Chinese side. Do you envision any real problem occurring where the Chinese might actually invade Taiwan? I think it remains a distinct threat that there could be a military contingency around Taiwan. And the people's Republic of China has actually stated as official policy. That it is not taking the invasion of Taiwan off the table. That that remains one of the potential options for the reunification of Taiwan. Their position has been changing over time. In terms of their disturbance of the status quo across the Taiwan Strait, actions that they are taking with their military to undermine peace and stability. The American position has remained steadfast and consistent. One China policy, Taiwan Relations Act, three joint communicates that we agreed with China back in the 1970s and 80s that laid out that from our perspective, there should be no unilateral changes to the status quo across the Taiwan Strait. We continue to believe that. And we will continue to push back against any effort to change the status quo by force. Now there is legislation now moving forward through Congress to kind of toughen up the existing support the U.S. has for Taiwan. Is administration adopted a position on that legislation yet? Well, I'm actually going to have the opportunity later today, literally later today to go up to the hill to talk to some members about this legislation. I prefer to have the opportunity to lay it out for them before I lay it out on TV. But I will just say this, there are elements of that legislation with respect to how we can strengthen our security assistance for Taiwan. That are quite effective and robust that will improve Taiwan's security. There are other elements that give us some concern. Let's go back to Ukraine for a moment. In hindsight, which is always 2020, is there anything the administration could have done to prevent Putin from invading or told the allies more forcefully that this invasion was going to occur to convince them because it seemed as if they didn't really believe it was going to happen.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,884,2022-11-19 14:24:22
18271," more forcefully that this invasion was going to occur to convince them because it seemed as if they didn't really believe it was going to happen. What would you have done or would you think you should have done in hindsight if anything differently than you did? Given that we're still in the middle of this unfolding crisis, it's hard to get the kind of level of perspective to look back and say, hey, maybe we could have done this instead of that. There's always something you could have improved upon. I would never say no, no, no, we did everything absolutely perfectly. But six months into this invasion, I'm fairly well convinced that Putin was going to do this no matter what, that he considered this central to his legacy as President of Russia. And he was not going to be knocked off course. The only thing that was going to stop him was the physical might of the Ukrainian forces holding back his ability to take key and take other major cities back by the weapons that we provided them. That was the strategy we executed. I think we executed it well. And I think Ukraine is in a position now today to ensure that they will remain a strong sovereign viable independent state, even as they continue to try to resist Russian aggression on a portion of their territory. In terms of the allies, we took unprecedented measures, quite novel measures to declassify information, to make presentations both to our allies and to the international community. And I think over time that actually did build a sense of unity that continues to this day, an allied unity, transatlantic unity has been a huge thorn on the side for Vladimir Putin, as he's tried to break that and tried to produce a weaker, less cohesipnato when in fact what he's gotten is the exact opposite. So what you're referring to, I think, is that to my surprise when I was reading The New York Times about this was going on, information that seemed like it was vital information was declassified and in fact given to the press about the troop movements of the Russians. Was that a complicated decision to come to controversial within the administration to say we're going to declassify and leak our best intelligence about what the Russians are doing? It definitely took a whole process of us thinking about all of the risks and benefits of doing that, especially since it was uncharted territory. And that involved me sitting with our intelligence professionals, our diplomats, and ultimately with the president to bless a strategy that would involve the systematic declassification of information so that no one would be surprised. And so that Russia could not try to generate pretext for what it was doing. And I think it turned out to be an effective method of putting Russia on the back foot, putting the Western Alliance on the front foot and giving us the opportunity to build a coalition that is currently supporting Ukraine. So as I said earlier, hindsight's always 2020. And hindsight, would you have exited Afghanistan differently than the way you did it? Well, at the end of the day, any time you have a circumstance where you're ending a 20-year war with 20 years of decisions and mistakes that have piled up through multiple administrations, the exit would not be easy. There was no clean, easy exit. And I think the strategic decision to go to end that war after 20 years was absolutely the correct decision. Where there are things that we could have done differently, I think the answer to that is always yes. And there will be time as I end up looking back and reflecting on that period to pinpoint what some of those might have been. But from my perspective, the underlying decision to end the war in Afghanistan, which the president took, I think, in a quite courageous way, was the correct decision. And one year later, to me, it is the time that has passed is only reinforced the correctness of that decision. Many people have held your job, have a burnout after a few years. You look like you're in good shape and you're young. You're the second youngest person ever have this job. So you anticipate doing this for an entire four-year period of this first term, if it's another term, let's say this four-year period of time. I serve at the pleasure of the president, but I feel passionate about the work that I'm doing. I feel blessed to be part of this team. I feel blessed to be able to serve President Biden, and I'd like to keep doing it. And you're one of the most fascinating entrepreneurs because you all started with young. What did you learn? Did you always think that you'd be an entrepreneur? Probably, yes. I think, which is a bit sad. From age what, five? It is.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,885,2022-11-19 14:28:47
18272," Probably, yes. I think which is a bit sad. From age what, five? I'm not sure. I come from a family of entrepreneurs, so even I probably can spell the word and still can't. It's sort of in my blood, but it's, it's, it's, it's really fun starting a business. It's, and fun growing a business. I feel it's a real privilege. And I started my business officially at 18, but I think I knew I wanted to do it very differently from about 15. But I'm sure it's, you know, you, if you're surrounded by it, it feels very natural. So, um, so yes, it's, it's fun. And it started how you started by making, you want Florence. It was an Italy and you started handbags. Yeah, so I, I knew I was actually given a handbag, um, by my mother when I was about 61 of her old handbags. And I remember how it made me feel. And I think fashion is fascinating for the mood, changing the confidence boosting aspects. And there's a tribal aspects of, of what fashion does. And so I went at, at 18 to Florence, knowing that was the home of, of, of Lebhagus, which is what interested me. I just wanted to learn actually, and be surrounded by craftsmen who, I mean, making things is important. And that's going to be very interesting, I think, over the next sort of 10 years. I think the on-shoring of, of craft and manufacturing is going to be fascinating, actually. And I watched the off-shoring, and literally saw it. And I think we're going to be seeing that coming back, um, to local. We have to, when we're all looking at, uh, objectives in terms of carbon, you know, proximity is going to be key.

Welcome to Bloomberg Power Players, the series that talks to some of the most influential figures in the world of sport about their rise, the success of their sport, and what the future holds. It's a sport that's produced arguably the greatest athlete of all time, Muhammad Ali. Centuries old boxing is now a billion dollar business with some fighters earning hundreds of millions of dollars for every single bite. One man who's been behind some of the biggest fights this century is the British promoter Eddie Hurn. Now the most recent off them this year's heavyweight title rematch between Anthony Joshua and Alexander Usek. He's the son of the fellow promoter Barry Hurn, larger than life personality who's never been afraid to be at the center stage with an ambition, an ambition to dominate the world of boxing. Bloomberg's Danny Berger went to speak to Eddie Hurn for a brand new series of Bloomberg Power Players. Hi, Eddie. Thanks for joining. Thanks for being here now. Yeah, and I actually want to start here in Brentwood where you spent your childhood. And now you're in a world that's tough. And you're in a world that's violent both physically and often metaphorically.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,886,2022-11-19 14:33:14
18273," Now you're in a world that's tough, it's violent both physically and often metaphorically as well. Did your childhood preparing for that tough world? Yeah, I mean, I'm kind of like first generational wealth. My dad is from, you know, working-class stock from the Council of State in Dagnum, made money. I'd have, you know, privileged upbringing, but I had a working-class dad who was petrified of me being a sport rich kid. He called me Silver Spoon. Oh, that's just one thing. I pray before you were born with a Silver Spoon, but you had to polish it as well. Yeah, and turn it gold. That's what I was actually. He was, you know, it was very important that the work ethic that he had growing up was instilled in me. And that's how I was raised. And everything's kind of geared through sport. Right. So, you know, I always- Did you ever try to shield you, though, from the sort of more tough aspect of it? No, no, he wanted me to be in there because he wanted, he was petrified of me being that kid that he hated growing up, you know, the kid that had everything, really. So, he loved me being in that world with him. You know, I remember being in with him in bags, roads, kickboxing events in Thailand, with him in Bangkok, you know, that were pitiful places. And that was part of growing up. I followed him everywhere. All the shows, you know, around the world. And because that was a lot of the times that I got to spend with him, because he was away a lot. But, you know, going back to sport, everything was geared around sport. Right. And you followed him into sport as well, and into matrimon. And when you did, you inherited his rivals as well. And when you started, they were meant decades older than you. What did it mean to be so young against those men? I think you just more fearless, you know, you're naive, which I definitely was when I went into boxing. But that helped me, because I had a plan, I had a vision and strategy that many thought wasn't achievable. But because I wasn't tarnished with the bitterness of the boxing industry or that frustration of the boxing industry, I went with what I thought was achievable. You think it's still better? Terrible. And you know, I've been around boxing since I was eight years old, but I've been working in boxing for 12 or 13 years. And it affects you, because, you know, there's very little loyalty. You know, you, the ups and downs of, you know, staging a major event around the world, and then next week, the day before, you know, a fight as out with an injury or as you really injured or, you know, there's, you have to sleep with one eye out, because it's a very competitive world in an outside of the ring. Well, you see, there's no loyalty, but looking at you and your fighters, you're very close with them. I think of the Anthony Joshua, for example. Yeah, I think, but we really work off the basis of, if you want to be with us, then, you know, we will, of course, give you all the respect in the world. We don't tell our liars. We're full of integrity. We're honest. We want to be a part of that journey with you. And sometimes you have relationships where it's almost as though contracts aren't required, because you believe in someone so much, you know, and that could be Anthony Joshua or Katie Taylor. You know, before them, Tony Bell, you down in barca, Karl Frotch, people that, you know, you know, you know, wouldn't turn that back on you. That's a nice feeling. And when they give you that loyalty, you give it back to them 10 fold. So, but you're in a world, it's price-fighting. Right. Now, these, these men and women are getting paid to fight. But when you are that close with them, does it prevent you from being fully objective? I want to be close with the fighter, because I want to wear my heart and my sleeve. The best nights for me, or where I'm jumping up and down, looking silly, diving over the rope, celebrating, because again, it comes down to sport. I'm a failed athlete, really. If you asked me what I would have wanted to be, and as a kid growing up, was a sportsman, but this is the next best thing. You know, like that always said to me, if you can get 1% of the adrenaline that a fighter gets when he walks to the ring or when he wins the World title, you're very lucky, man. Sometimes I feel like it's 60% percent of the time. Do you get that adrenaline or nerves before a fight? All the time. But, you know, things nerves, nerves slowly fade in a radicate as you get used to. It's just like a fighter. Now, when you make that walk for the first time, it's very different to when you make that walk for the seventh or eighth time. It's just like doing a press conference. You know, the first press conference I ever did, the major one was for the World Heavyweight title. I was shaking, I had to sit on my hands while I was speaking. Now, you know, I'm quite famous, but I don't have notes. Yeah, well, speaking of which, Eddie, do you consider yourself a salesman? Absolutely. That's my greatest skill. That's all I have.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,887,2022-11-19 14:37:43
18274," Now, you know, I'm quite famous, but I don't have no- Yeah, well speaking of which, Eddie, do you consider yourself a salesman? Absolutely. That's my greatest skill. That's all I am. Hmm. Really? So how integral is Eddie as the showman? Eddie is the celebrity to match room into your fight? Well, that's what we've built over the last decade or so, is building the brand of matrim, but building my brand to make sure that you're not always solely reliant on talent. Talent is always key to a boxing business or any sports business, but if you can build your own brand, so to speak, and we, you know, Dana White, who is someone that I'm, you know, very fond of and I have a lot respect for at the U.S.C., same model, and we copy a lot of what the U.S.C do, and I openly tell them. Right. And that's a big compliment to them. But the U.S.E really has just shot up out of nowhere. No problem. Yeah, but that's really part of that growth has been Dana White. Right. Are you worried they're stealing your audience though? No, I think it's a different audience, but I think it can also co-exist together. You know, and I think, you know, I went to the U.S.C. London and recently is my first time. Love it. You know, different crowd. You know, not everyone knew what I was, whereas if I went to a boxing show, everyone would. So, but it's, it's fight schools. So it's, you know, I think they can create this together. Great organisation, great vision, great, you know, pattern of growth globally, and the kind of thing that we're looking to achieve as well. But there are a lot of boxing purists out there who would look at, you know, setting up a fight between two YouTube stars and say, this isn't the sport. Is there an element of the business of boxing taking away from the sport of boxing? I think in anything that you do, you always have the temptation to, I wouldn't even call it sell out, but to move away, that the reality is, is the hard core element of any industry. He's a much smaller market than the casual audience within that market. And that's so true in boxing. Hard core boxing fans who are the beating heart of the sport are a small minority versus a potential audience for a YouTube fight between KSI and Logan Paul. You have to keep evolving, you have to keep trying things. It's hard for me because I'm a hardcore boxing fan. Yeah, so does that make you uncomfortable? Yeah, very uncomfortable. When I did that fire, you know, at the stagom centre in L.A., it was incredible. That's seven million people watching the press conference, right? We had 15,000 in Los Angeles. The viewing figures were huge globally, but I did feel very uncomfortable to press conference. Would you do something like that again? No, I wouldn't. But I learned, I understood the audience. You know, there was, that was good also to talk about my brain. That introduced me to a whole other world. When I'm walking down the street, different people are talking to me now through that event. So you say you wouldn't do a fight like that again, but is there some degree to which that's inevitable, but that's the way the world's moving? Yeah, I think, you know, you've got someone like Jake Paul, who has turned YouTube a two-boxer. So that's kind of, you get away with that, but YouTube versus YouTube are. You know, I'd like to think that our business is in a position where we don't have to necessarily go down that route. I feel like it's important to concentrate on real boxing, which still has a huge amount of growth to take part globally. But we're also led by numbers. You know, we're led by subscription, we're led by gate receipts, and clearly that was an event that was extremely successful. Coming up, Eddie Herne talks about taking on America.

18275," music on the David Rubenstein Show here to peer conversations I uncover the untold stories of the world's most successful leaders watch Wednesdays on Bloomberg Television music welcome back to Bloomberg Power Players it was 2018 and Eddie Hurn signed a groundbreaking broadcasting agreement with the streaming giant DeZone the deal with his company Matrim boxing was worth a billion dollars over eight years making Hurn the sports first billion dollar promoter let's rejoin Danny Berger who puts Eddie Hurn on the spot about big TV deals you first heard yourself called a billion dollar promoter what do they make you think? it was a nice feeling we made a lot of mistakes when we went into America I think sometimes the marketplace and America in general won't quite recognize the British humour or sarcasm I think you know you might not agree with that and I went in very bullish very bullish there was a big debate about when we did that billion dollar deal with DeZone do we tell anyone how big that deal was? and my response was yeah absolutely that's made because I think if you're going into a marketplace with no brand presence no brand profile you have to make waves, you have to create noise and I'm not a believer in moving in quietly and slowly taking our time but you know there was a debate going on this maybe that was an approach that worked for us but I don't feel that's my mantra or my start you know I wanted to go in there I wanted to be a disruptor you talk about a jacket work? yeah I do but it took three years to work and I thought it would work instantly with the budget that we had you know we upset a lot of people every door that we tried to go through it was being shut on us by the industry you know why would you want to let this Brit into our market? we almost have to get together to stop him but at the same time it's the worst thing you could do to me because that made me work ten times harder and made me ten times more committed personally to get to where we wanted to get to and fast forward three or four years on and particularly designing of Canelo Avarez you know the pound for pound number one the biggest star in America has put us on the map as really the biggest promotional company in America how do you weigh that up between growing globally with Canelo for example versus retaining that mom and pop UK family run feel of this business? the beauty of our business is we are a family business you know and the story of matrim is incredible when you think that 40 years ago this year this business was created under a snooker hole in rumpford by my dad and Steve Dawson who's still here and he's secretary who's still here 40 years on and you know any family business that I think the most difficult thing is to transform that family business to you know a big national business to a global powerhouse because it's the transition you know you come from a different mentality of family business but that's helped us in our mindset you know here at matrim we very rarely although we are having to now recruit us at a senior level all our senior executives all our board members have come from 15 years old 16 years old because you have to understand the mindset that we have we take this very personally how do you make sure there's diversity then when it is people who have been with the business for so long especially in a very male dominated world I mean you know some of our senior directors here are female you know I mean my sister sits on the ball, she's the former producer for Premier League football and she's got Emily Fraser who runs our multi-sport division started at 17 in this business so it's about giving people opportunity of course and now because of the growth globally we are having to see some senior senior highers come in as we move to the inevitable stage probably of an IPO in years to come and that",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,889,2022-11-19 14:46:15
18276," We are having to see some senior, senior highers come in as we move to the inevitable stage probably of an IPO in years to come and that's my mindset. We got to a place probably 10 years ago and my dad said I can't believe where this business comes. Why IPO? Why is that the thing? Because for me, I feel like that's the next general step of succession, of success, of growth. You know, what are the fundamental next steps you can take to prove yourself as a global powerhouse and that's something that we will consider in time. The only way I can be recognised is to outperform anything that my dad ever achieved. So to take the business from major national business, which you know, to international global powerhouse, talk about floating on the New York Stock Exchange. But is there not a fair you obviously become beholden to these shareholders who have perhaps different goals than you? Definitely, but you have to weigh that up with growth. You can't, you know, and this is an ongoing argument with me and my dad and probably it's only in the last year or so he started to understand my ambition of we can't be that family business and move globally in the way and with the speed that I want to. So something's got to give. And he's always said, I will never, you know, we're not answering to anyone. We do what we want. We make our decisions. And maybe it'll stay like that, but we also understand that you get to a point that to reach the next level, you have to make changes. So is that you disagreeing with him then? Yeah, absolutely. We disagree all the time, you know what I mean? And he's happy where we are. And numbers are through the roof. You know, the growth over the last five, ten years has been incredible. And you know, as a stand alone family business, probably one of the biggest in the country. Well, to that growth point, we're talking about that Gizon deal in 2018. At the time you had said the growth is not in paper view. It's streaming. Do you still stand behind that? Yeah, I do. I think that there will be certain fights and there will be certain individuals that the paper view model will only ever exist for. Can that ever have a good example? And see Joshua in big fights against usick, Tyson Fury. But we made our move away from Scott, which was our boxing broadcast of the 12 years, because we felt there was too much paper. Is that a hard decision to make? It was, but again, it's still built behind the global mindset. DeZone gave us the opportunity and the ability to create localized events in markets of great importance. And we couldn't do that with Scott. And of course, the money was significantly more. I mean, I think about broadcasting rates and they feel like they're hotter than ever for sports. You have an Amazon getting into the game with tennis, football. Have they reached out to you at all? Yeah, of course. We speak to all, all broadcasts, all plastic. But you do something like that? Yeah, I mean, we're in a great position. We're content owners. We're rights holders. We run sports, different sports, 10, 11, 12 sports, where we create global calendars as almost the governing bodies for those sports. So we own the IP. So we're extremely powerful in that position in a world as you said, where sports rights are becoming more and more valuable. So the emergence of streaming partners, whether it's Amazon, whether it's, of course, is owned by a huge partner of ours. And Sky, all these linear broadcasters as well, are emerging their digital offerings. It doesn't matter if it's Sky or BBC or ITV, BBC iPlayer, now all of a sudden become huge. I mean, we just did the World Snooker Finals in Sheffield, 4.4 million audience for the final huge numbers. And across our player, you look at the numbers from their digital offering. And that is the future. And that's one of the reasons we made them move. Just because of the money and the ability to grow globally. But because we truly believe that streaming is the future.

Bloomberg's covering all things crypto, but people, the transactions, and the technology. Bloomberg crypto Tuesdays. Welcome back to Bloomberg Power Players. So what about the future of boxing? Recently Eddie Hurn promoted the fight between the Irish Boxer Katie Taylor and the Puerto Rican fighter Amanda Serrano. It was at Madison Square Garden. It was in New York and the bout was described as the biggest women's fight of all time. Now it's one of many big changes in the sport according to Eddie Hurn. Music In terms of looking towards the future, what is women's boxing going to be? Women's boxing obviously through April 30th at Madison Square Garden has changed forever and actually it's quite funny because I'm negotiating a fight at the moment. It's not as big as Taylor Serrano, but it's a big fight. It's a big undisputed fight in women's boxing. I would say that the value of that fight prior to Taylor Serrano has at least trebled and the numbers that are being offered back and forward are numbers that I never expected to see. It was well documented. Both fighters made in excess of seven figures at Madison Square Garden, which was ground breaking. Now, I'm not saying that's going to be a norm, but the money now in women's boxing is significant change. What do you think would be the normal then? I mean, for a major fight like that, they could be making six figures or just over 100, 150. Is there going to call to beat the talent in this world? It's hard that the problem with women's boxing is the deepness of talent. The high end, the elite level of women's boxing is incredible. KT Taylor, Serrano, but in the male side of the sport, you could make 10 great fights in the division. In women's boxing, maybe it's just one fight in the division, but that's changing because these individuals are setting the standard, raising the bar, paving the way for young female fighters to actually have a big future within the sport. We're seeing more female fighters than ever walk through the doors of local boxing clubs within the community. Eddie, do you get pushback on, okay, so on one hand, there's a ground breaking fight with women in boxing. On the other hand, setting up fights in Saudi where women only recently were able to drive. Not really, and one of the mindsets of Saudi is to try and bring women's boxing into those events. So I think that we've staged one event in Saudi, which came with some criticism, but also was a huge success. Personally, did it feel strange? Not really, because I was dealing with people, individuals, the sports authority there, that I saw the vision that they have. You know, you always get the difficult questions, but from a sports infrastructure perspective and from a building of sport within that region, for me, it's exciting. You don't think it tarnishes the reputation of a person. You know what, as well? It's price-fighting. It's very difficult for me to say to a fighter who is putting their life on the line every time they walk through the ring. You have an opportunity here to earn four fights. I tell you, though, if you have shareholders after you IPO, this kind of stuff is important to them, this ESG stuff. And that's either side we look at or we...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,891,2022-11-19 14:54:55
18278," Yes, she starts. Yeah, maybe. And that's either saying we look at or we move down the barri-her-m-root of, you know, we make the decisions we believe in. I think that we have an obligation to our fighters to maximize their earnings and their revenue in a very dangerous sport. And I don't want to lean on PGA Tour, Formula One, WWE. But these are organisations that are hard for me to say this. It's substantially bigger than ours that are willing to move into that marketplace and stage major events. And I just feel that sometimes people don't understand, you know, boxing. If I can make my client five times more to stage a mega-fight when I understand and have seen firsthand the risks involved in boxing, then it's something we always have to consider. You could change one thing about your sport, what would it be? Well, I think it would be the ability to make the biggest fights possible in the sport. And the problem with boxing versus UFC, for example, is, you know, you have different broadcasters. You have different promoters. My job is to deliver the best fights for the zone. Our Hamons best job is to deliver the best fights for Fox. Bob Arons' job is to deliver the best fights for ESPN. And no one really wants to give and take and share. You're looking to dominate the marketplace with the best product. So the frustration of fight fans versus the UFC, where they have a blanket policy and fighters quite frankly are told what forces. Right. And a lot of them prevented from boxing as well because of that. Yeah. But that's, but also the great thing about the UFC business, as I said, is the ability of every MMA fighter wants to be a UFC fighter. And we want to create that same ethos. So could boxing ever move to that model of one? Yeah, we have approaches. We have approaches all the time for people who say, can we roll up boxing? Any names you want to give them? No, but can we buy a boxing? Yeah. And the answer is no. You can't, but we can get there naturally through being consistent, through being good enough, and through having a relentless work ethic that will make us unbeatable. Anyone that's questioned for me, what do you think is the biggest challenge this year and beyond? Time. You know, time, the engine, you know, the love and just you know, keep doing what you're doing. The sport can be very frustrating. The business can be very frustrating. You know, you can build something and create it. And a day before it can all fall apart. And you know, you could be on your knees saying, why do I bother? And the reason is because I love what I do. But the challenge is time. You know, we're creating 55 nights a year at the moment. And we want to get to a stage where we're staging two events a week globally. So the biggest challenge is to manage that growth as a company that came from. A cupboard in wrong foot. I wish I had more time too. Very good enough to end it there. Thank you so much. Thank you. That's all for this episode of Bloomberg Power Players. We'll be back soon with another influential figure from the world of sport. Next time around. See you soon. So what's the best investment advice you've ever put in given by anybody? The compound interest, the compounding of returns is an incredible miracle of business, finance and human existence. Everything you...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,892,2022-11-19 14:59:24
18279," Compound interest, the compounding of returns is an incredible miracle of business, finance, and human existence. Everything you learn is additive every day and if you keep added and don't quit, it's an incredible miracle. And it's not just interest. It was always said above compound interest returns, compound business returns, compound human returns. They're all very additive because you'll learn every day and if you keep at it, it's very, very helpful. In your observation of investors, what do you think is the biggest mistake that average investors make? Selling it the wrong time. And they sell when the prices go down? Yes, or yes. Not keeping. People have conviction or if they invest for the right reasons, just keep at it. So before you invent pioneer disrupt, before you change the world Bloomberg. A week of hope about inflation and interest rates, about China's relations with the United States, about Britain getting serious about its budget, and of course former President Trump's hope that he can do it all again. This is Bloomberg Wall Street week. I'm David Weston. This week, special contributor Larry Summers on what came out of the G20 meetings in Bali. And former Fed Vice Chair Rich Clarity on the liquidity problem in the Treasury's market and what can be done about it. It was a week of hoping, hoping that things just might start to move in a better direction in US-China relations. After a President Biden's meeting in Bali with President Xi. I absolutely believe there's need not be a new co-war. I do not think there's any imminent attempt on the part of China to invade Taiwan. And I made it clear that our policy in Taiwan has not changed at all. Hoping that inflation may just be easing a bit in the United States with Fed Vice Chair Leo Brainer telling Bloomberg, we might see a bit of moderation in rate hikes. I think it will probably be appropriate to move to a slower pace of increases. But I think what's really important to emphasize, we've done a lot. But we have additional work to do both on raising rates and sustaining restraint to bring inflation down. Hoping that the new British government has gotten the message as it put forth a new budget designed to reassure the markets. So today we deliver a plan to tackle the cost of living crisis and rebuild our economy. Our priorities are stability, growth and public services. And then of course there's that special kind of hope the former President Trump brings to everything he does. Deciding that despite what happened in the midterms to his hand-picked candidates, this was the right time to announce he's running again for President. In order to make America great and glorious again, I am tonight announcing...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,893,2022-11-19 15:03:36
18280," and pick candidates. This was the right time to announce he's running again for president. In order to make America great and glorious again, I am tonight announcing my candidacy for president of the United States. Even as prominent investor and Republican supporter Ken Griffin of Citadel couldn't find much to hope for in Mr. Trump's candidacy. He lost in 2020. We lost Georgia because of his behavior in the Senate race in 2020. That's a second loss. And then this year, the Republicans lost the Senate because the Trump-back candidates in the Senate races were rejected by American voters. That's a three-time loser. And I'd like to think that the Republican party's ready to move on from somebody who's been for this party a three-time loser. But whatever we were all hoping for this week, we didn't really get that much out of the market. It's which traded without real conviction, with the S&P 500, off just 7 tens of a percent for the week, and the Nasdaq down 1.57 percent. And the yield on the 10 year up about seven basis points ending the week at 3.82. To help us sort it all out, we welcome now a sunny, best-less CEO of Rock Creek and Bob Michael. He's chief investment officer and head of the Global Fixed Income Unit at JP Morgan Asset Management. So welcome both you. Great to have you back. Let me start with you. I mean, I watched the eco numbers. I listened to the Fed speak. I sort of felt like I was going both ways at the same time. What did you see? Well, for a bond investor, all of us who have been battered this year, this is one of the weeks that made sense to us. We had a nice tailwind coming in from the inflation data. It was great all the way through core. When you look at shelter, everything. Yes, the markets went a little crazy. They went wild. And the central bankers did what they're supposed to do. They came in one by one and reminded us, don't declare victory yet. These are only a couple prints. There are more hikes to come, but maybe there is some optimism. And the market settled down. So I look at this week and I thought, this is the first great week in a long time. So, Avsaniz, that's the way you saw it as well. And there's still some more rage hikes to come. How many? I think at least another three to start with. 50 basis points next time in December, followed by at least two or three 25 basis points next year. And then we'll see from there. And I think what Bob said is very true at the same time as we were listening to at least three Fed people come and speak. I wrote down, I think they all had very different coats. And you had some of that when Labour not talked. But you also had the president of St. Louis Fed say something slightly different as if we would start continue with rate increases for a while longer than she had implied. And then of course, we had Susan Collins come in today with even sort of potential 75 basis points. So we're hearing numbers that are a little bit all over the place and trying to make sense of it. So Bob, the market's making it harder for the Fed as a practical matter. They were at the start of the week. I think not so much now. I think we're all in the same spot. We've all got realistic expectations. The Fed's headed to 4.5%. They'll get there sometime in the first quarter. We'll see where inflation is. If it's below the Fed funds rate, then that gives them some scope to pause on the tightening. We can reevaluate at that point. But right now, Bon Yelts have gone up a long way in a very short period of time. It's time for a breath. Bob, does that get us to a soft landing? Unfortunately, it does not. And I think that's the one consistent message from the Fed. Susan Collins aside, which is there is going to be pain for businesses and households. When you have this magnitude of rate hikes in such a short period, and you're also withdrawing liquidity through quantitative tightening, it's going to bite. And we're already seeing it's biting the economy hard. Thankfully, it's also now starting to bite inflation. So I want to pick up on the liquidity just for a moment. If I could have sunny. How big a problem do we have in the Treasury market now with the liquidity? I hear conflicting things. Some people are very concerned about it. Big problems. I think Bob leaves it much more than I do. But as you know, they're very, very big problems with the trading volumes. And services and departments cannot�予ns.techcontentους. steht der med.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,894,2022-11-19 15:08:12
18281," More than I do, but as you know, there are very, very big problems with the trading volumes. And for big traders or even small traders, getting bits is becoming much harder and you're working in a much less liquid environment. And I know between Treasury and the banks, there have been a lot of meetings, but I'm not so sure if we have a solution yet. Well, could the Fed make it easier with some regulatory changes? It could, but I think the moaning that we hear in the bond market about liquidity, it's always there. We always complain, we don't get the price we want. The reality is, for the last couple of weeks, you could have moved your portfolio in any direction you wanted, up and down duration, up and down credit risk without any kind of penalty. So I'm not that big a believer in the lack of liquidity. I'm sorry when we talk about a soft landing, it brings me back to oil because oil did move this week and it moved down in the price of oil. And most people I talked to suggested it was in part because of a concern about global recession, really a backing offer, at least a softening in the markets. You came out of that business, you really know energy backwards and forwards. What are we seeing in oil? So as you said, oil prices did, the future numbers went down below 80, which was a big shift from a little while ago. But my view is still that we might just avoid a recession in the U.S. if we're fortunate, but we may not be able to avoid it in Europe and the rest of the world. And a lot of the, I think, softness for these numbers that we saw today and in recent days is because of the expectations in China. Now, China is starting to open up a little bit maybe and loosen its COVID rules, but that's going to take a while. And I think that softening is softening the oil markets and will probably continue to do that. Is it opening up? I mean, I'm not exactly sure of exactly what's happening because on the one hand, we hear them saying things that sound a little softer on zero COVID and the other hand, we hear about a lot of cases. So it is, it was kind of interesting. We had a team out in Asia as this week and they came back with interesting news that there is actually some physical opening up, but now you have people who are afraid to go out because they've been told so long that if they go out, they'll get COVID. And so you have seen a very different phenomenon, which is actual, you know, individuals not wanting to go out of their houses versus the government, which has been very strict about you're getting out of your house. I'm sorry, we also have the G20, of course, Minigame and Bali. And some people thought there would be no single statement coming out of it. They did come to some agreement in part driven by some of the developing countries. Should that be encouraging to investors, actually, that we're getting back perhaps a little toward multilateral cooperation? Much more positive news came out of the G20 than we all expected. And as you said, there was also a lot of big stress on reform of the multilateral lending because the big news out of that meeting was that there's huge needs when it comes particularly to emerging markets, climate-related investments. And there's no way with the existing finances of the multilateral that that could be met. So that was why there was a lot of emphasis on the reform of the multilateral sector, but also getting the multilateral to work much better with the private sector to generate more resources. And you saw that very particular case of Indonesia, which was discussed a lot and written up a lot with about 20 billion going into replace coal in Indonesia with cleaner fuels. About another important development this week, it's sort of a rolling development, as the outcomes of the midterm elections. We found out that the Democrats will hold on to the Senate. The Republicans will get a narrow majority in the House. What does that communicate if anything to investors? Is that sort of a steady as you go away because we have a split government not much is going to happen either way? So it for sure is, I will tell you, going back to the G20, we're actually hearing from clients, large institutional clients, that they're more confident about allocating to markets when the G20 countries are talking to one another again and working with one another again. So that's a huge positive. I don't remember that in gosh over a decade. When you go back to the gridlock in Washington, I hate to say it, but the markets kind of...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,895,2022-11-19 15:12:21
18282," gosh over a decade. When you go back to the gridlock in Washington, I hate to say it, but the markets kind of like it. It's when there are dramatic policy changes. You have to reprice everything in the markets. It becomes destabilizing. There are always going to be some winners. There are going to be some losers. This time, if we know we're going to have gridlock, we can focus on bringing inflation down and trying to avoid a recession and have a soft land. I think a lot of people in the street think it's sort of hypocritic. First, do no harm. If you're not doing anything, you're at least not messing things up. Bob Michael of JP Morgan, and I'm sorry, a bachelor's of rock week, will be staying with us as we look at what this week meant for our investment decisions. That's the next on Wall Street Week. I'm Bloomberg. Okay, so you're moving in on me quick. Just driving me with your fancy hands. I'm going to deal with your night because it's really bothering me. My night. Yeah. He's a troublemaker. Yeah. What did you get up to this weekend? You know, just robot stuff. A lot of chess. I was practicing for you. I know you're pretty good. I don't like that. I will take this. Put it over here. Not cool. Not cool. All right. I will. I will concede. I can see. You got me, Bid. Very good game. Well played. Thank you, sir. Thank you. We think it will create some of the most valuable companies the markets ever seen. I think it's certainly driven companies like Cisco, given them the life that they've had. It's obviously also spectacularly volatile. But the market has pulled back in this sector since it came public since it began in 1995. It's pulled back 30 to 50 percent at least seven or eight times. That was Henry Blodgett talking about the internet and tech on Wall Street way back in June of 2000. When the number one movie in the country was Mission Impossible 2 and the most popular song in the country was Maria Maria by Santana. Bob Michael of JP Morgan and Fsani Bachelors of Rod Creek are still with us. So Fsani certainly Mr. Blodgett was right that we gave us some awfully big and successful companies. No question about it. Some people thought that would happen as well in the crypto space. This week we're not quite as sure after FTX. What do we make of that? Is that? Does that have broader significance to the markets or is it just a one-off? Hopefully it is more limited. I think there's no question that without regulation and we've all been talking about having this sector regulated. It would help. It's the market itself but also the investors going in. Having this particular come you know FTX which is an exchange for crypto and so be based in the Bahamas with not just no regulation but also with a few people who have very limited experience in finance or in anything really. I think the shocking part of it they",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,896,2022-11-19 15:16:42
18283," But also with a few people who had very limited experience in finance or in anything really, I run it. I think the shocking part of it, David, was that very, very sophisticated venture firms from Sequoia and others who were invested. It was not just retail getting involved in that market. So it was a surprise, but hopefully it will get limited. And I think it has put a lot of pressure on increasing regulation sooner here. And that will be a good thing for the market. Now let's not forget that the whole market is less than, you know, a 900 billion. I'm not saying that that's tiny, but it's still not significant enough to create any kind of stress in the market. Unless we're missing something that we don't know at this point. I think what's important, David, when you watch that clip and that was the absolute peak in the dot com bubble. Yes, there was a massive shakeout. There was a massive consolidation. But I would argue the internet and tech evolved far beyond what any of us ever thought it would be in 2000. I wonder if we're going through the same thing with crypto and NFTs that it got a great start. There is going to be a shakeout of Sonya's right. There's probably going to be a lot of regulation. But when I talk to the young people on our desk and our platform, there's still a big believer. And if the millennials are a believer, 22 years from now, they're going to be looking at this clip. And I hope we got it right. That's fascinating. There is no question as a generational issue here. Let's come back to the current generation and people who's old as I am. I'm older than you are, but it's all I'm. What about bonds right now? Do you invest in bonds? For the first time in a decade, absolutely. And I will tell you that we're seeing interest from everywhere now. Every wealth management platform in JP Morgan, every institutional client, they're coming to us. They're putting money in bonds. They're looking to commit more. And they haven't done so for years. If I look at where we got to at the start of the year, a general bond fund, the Bloomberg Ag yielded 1.7%. Now we're up at 4.7%. We have 3% higher yields. And that's going to track investment. And as I said, I think the Fed is close to the end. I don't know if they get to 5%. We're kind of in the 4.5, 4.3, 4.4%. That's going to bring a lot of stability to the market at these levels. Bonds are back. So, I'm saying you manage a fair amount of money. What about for you or bonds attractive at this point or are you just equities? I think as said, what is very interesting right now is even in any foundation or endowment or the assets that we manage, you're finding exactly the same phenomenon where people had moved away from bonds and cash. And we're all equities and private investments moving back into holding bonds. And as we're sort of reaching that 4.5%. That Bob talked about, much more interest in bonds in a more balanced kind of portfolio. And of course, people are looking at cash with 4% at Treasury bills at the level that is much higher than the last one. And it is much higher than cash in a very long time. But I think the bigger thing that is happening in the portfolio is we're looking at is obviously a lot of investors, institutional investors have been also investing in venture, private equity, real estate, in private form. And I think that is going to some sort of transformation too. Well, let's take a segue if we could from that sort of investment into COP27. As we're speaking right now, it's still going to end on Saturday. Right now, of Sony, you know far better than I do. It looks like it's going to be difficult for them to get to the objectives that they had. You're absolutely right. So far as we know tonight, the latest news was not too positive. Not things could change tomorrow morning, but they didn't really have anything major to announce. Again, as you remember in COP26, they had the G-Fans, which was a large number of large asset managers, signing up to make pretty significant shifts in their carbon print. But most recently, they started walking back from that or not wanting to sign quite on what they had agreed to in COP26. So I think it's very, very important as we're having these meetings. Maybe they shouldn't be every year.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,897,2022-11-19 15:21:00
18284," to sign quite on what they had agreed to in COP26. So I think it's very, very important, as we're having these meetings, maybe they shouldn't be every year, maybe they should be every other year or less often, but show some sort of progress. And the most important part of the discussion this time, David, has been a fact that developing countries, again, have felt that they are in some cases suffering because if they're an island economy, they're going underwater, if they are affected by droughts and by floods. A lot of it might be caused by those who did use a lot of carbon over the last 10, 20 years, and they're asking if they could get help. And that help is really not coming. And I think that is the really major summary of COP27, which is that the expectations of investments into climate are probably less than what we expected going into the COP. Well, and just picking up on that on the investments in it, Bob, I want to come back to you because one of the things that I'm taking away from COP27, you can certainly hear, listen to John Kerry, the president's special envoy on this subject. We're not going to get to it from public money alone. It's going to take a fair amount of private investment as a bond person. Are there bonds that are green bonds or in the climate area that make sense as a business matter? There are, I think for sure, if you're going to finance something, which is what bond investors do, you want something that has something of a green agenda to it. And we're hearing that from our clients. There's more and more money coming into the space. I think Afsania help is on the way for the island economies. The large-scale investors want to commit capital to this space. Well, the inflation reduction act, as it's called, a lot of people object to that title, a lot of money into the game here on that private side of something. Is it making a difference in the projects that are getting financed? No question. I think D'Area is a very powerful act and is the largest amount of money going in. And I think that will really help us in the U.S. to invest a lot more in climate-related food and ag, in battery storage, in residential and in community-related solar and wind. So that will be a major, major push. And we're seeing, as Bob mentioned, a lot of movement. I agree with him. I think it's just that in COP, where you expect the public money to go in, there was a sort of disappointment with that. But the private sector is doing a lot. The young generation is doing a lot. We just need the public sector to jump in when it comes to it outside of the IRA, of course. Bob, last word. Are you seeing a difference in your part of the business for the government tax policy when it comes to green bonds? We are. Yeah, absolutely. It's making a real difference, you see it? It is from our perspective. So yeah, everything we see that, and we didn't touch on the regulation, there's going to be more regulation poking through what qualifies as a green bond or not, and also to prevent any greenwashing, either in specific bonds or in bond funds. So watch this space. Yeah, okay. We're particularly with the new Congress going on. Thank you so much, really great to have both of you with us. This is F. Sonny Beschelus of Rock Creek and Bob Michael of J.P. Morgan. Coming up, we are going to take a look at next week on Wall Street all around the world.

You get insight into limitless possibilities, knowledge and inspiration to feed your ambition. So before you invent pioneer, disrupt. Before you change the world, Bloomberg. This is Wall Street week. I'm David Weston. This week in Asia we're going to be taking a close look at two big elections. Now in Malaysia, voting took place this Saturday just over a month after parliament was dissolved for a snap poll. And then meanwhile, Taiwan, that holds midterm this coming weekend. That's going to be a pulse check on the popularity of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party. As of course, we see geopolitical tensions continue to rise in the region. ECO wise, the highlight is on central bank meetings in Korea and New Zealand. And we're going to be live from Seoul for the B.O.K. with expectations there for a half point hike. Plus the RVNZ predicted to deliver its 6th straight 50 basis point move. The 2022 World Cup kicks off on Sunday in Qatar. The tournament is being held in the winter for the first time due to the blistering summer temperatures in the region. Thursday sees rate decision by Sweden's Riksbank. Economist forecast a 75 basis point hike, but surging food prices could tip the bank to raise by even more. We'll also on the same day get an account of the ECB's most recent policy meeting. And last, certainly not least, you energy ministers will be meeting to discuss policy outlook as Europe heads into the winter. A holiday short and weak for the observance of Thanksgiving Day. The main focal point for the week, it will center around the release of the FOMC minutes from that November meeting. A meeting that saw the Fed raise interest rates by 75 basis points for a 4th straight time. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said then that U.S. interest rates would go higher than earlier projected, but several Fed members since have indicated that they may be ready to downshift. A handful of earnings next week to watch including Zoom video, deer, and along devices best by Ann Nordstrom, keep an eye on those last two for a read on the strength of the consumer as the traditional kickoff to the holiday shopping season in the U.S. begins on Friday.

Thanks to Annabelle Druller's Danny Burger and Romaine Bostic. Coming up, we saw it happen in the guilt market, could a crisis come to the markets for U.S. treasuries and would it come from a lack of liquidity? We're going to ask former vice chair of the Fed, Richard Clarita of PIMCO. That's next on Wall Street Week on Bloomberg.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,899,2022-11-19 15:29:39
18286," Gaze Why do the biggest names in business choose Bloomberg? I have to do a great question. It's a great question. Great question. And this question I get all night. Bloomberg, top experts, great questions. Imagine simply climbing a cable into space. The concept is known as the space elevator. Not only could it significantly change how we leave planet Earth, but it could also completely transform humanity's relationship with space. And they're a scientist who think we could have already built it. We have the material. We have the technology. We have the lasers. We have the climbers. We have all of them. If a private entity wants to build it or a government, they can build it. It'll change society. We have no clue how colonizing in the space, how really spreading on the space will really change our society over the next 50 to 200 years. It'll be completely different. This is Wall Street Week. I'm David Weston. We spent a good deal of this week trying to figure out where the Fed is heading on rate increases. And part of what we were watching was the Fed's vice chair, Leo Brandard, who gave us at least some hope that we might be getting closer to slowing down. I think it will probably be appropriate soon. We're going to move to a slower pace of increases. But I think what's really important to emphasize, we've done a lot. But we have additional work to do, both on raising rates and sustaining restraint to bring inflation down. We welcome now, Ms. Brandard's predecessor, as vice chair, Richard Clarita, now global economic advisor to Pymco. So Richard, thank you so much for being back with us. Good to have you back with us. So do you agree with your successor there? Do you think we're at least approaching a point where we might slow down the pace of increases? David, I do. The Fed has done a lot this year. In fact, it'll be the fastest pace of rate hikes since the early 1980s. I do anticipate that at the December meeting, they'll slow the pace from 75 to 50 basis points. And I think as we move into 2023, I think they think. And I agree that they're close at least to a pause, probably in the first half of next year. They said in the November statement, they've done a lot, and they want to see how the rate hikes are impacting the economy. So Richard, you have the advantage of having been in the room and having been in the room relatively recently. Give us a sense of what they're looking at their dashboard. Because I'm going to say the economic numbers sometimes point in different directions. On the one hand, we do have some indications like the CPI numbers that may be slowing down a little bit, the inflation. On the other hand, the overall inflation is still pretty high. It is. And you know, the challenge of the Fed faces another central banks in the world is that the economy is running hot. And in particular, wages in the economy are growing much faster than consistent with the 2% longer run goal. And so I think that the Fed will be looking at the labor market data. It'll also be looking at inflation expectations. We have downshifted demand growth. There's an imbalance between demand and supply. And this year, demand growth has already downshifted. So that's an important thing to note. We're certainly along the way to where we need to be.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,900,2022-11-19 15:33:58
18287," far up. Give us your sense of what that is doing right now to financial conditions in the United States. Well, David, it is tightening conditions. Again, quantitative tightening is reversing quantitative easing. So the Fed's balance sheet is shrinking. Now, it's been very well telegraphed, and so markets certainly understand the pace and the modalities of tightening. But it is serving to tighten financial conditions, and that's consistent with what the Fed wants to do in terms of raising rates. So, Richard, that takes us to a subject that I know you've heard a lot about. We read about all the time, which is perhaps a problem with liquidity in the treasury market. There's more volatility in the treasury market, as I understand it, but that's inherent in raising rates. The question is, is there additional volatility because there's not as much liquidity? We hear at least anecdotally that some people are having difficulty buying and selling large lots of treasuries. Yeah, well, it's true. I went back and looked, I had the privilege of 20 years ago of serving as assistant treasury secretary in 01 or no 2. And in those years, debt outstanding was about $3 trillion, about 30% of GDP. This year, it's $23 trillion, or 100% of GDP. So quite simply, the amount of debt outstanding and the amount of treasury issuance is vastly larger than it was 10 or 15 years ago. And the plumbing of the intermediation system for treasury says not really expanded concomitantly with that. And so as a result, there is evidence on occasion of ill liquidity in the market, certainly in extreme cases, as we observed in March of 2020 or September 2019, it becomes even more evident. And so I think policymakers at the Fed and the treasury and other agencies are looking at ways in which treasury market functioning can be improved. And I think it's certainly something that should be studied and improved. And what are possible options if they do conclude there's an issue there? One of the most supposed to be reversing and going back to quantitative easing, that's one way to do it. Another might be actually to ameliorating some of their restrictions in regulation and repose after the 2008 Great Financial Crisis, which really is an issue that took a lot of the big banks and were limited to their participation in the market. Well, it's right. And so I think that one of the things David that we did in the spring of 2020 is that we did relax, something called the supplementary leverage ratio, in the sense that we would not count bank reserves or treasury holdings against that leverage ratio. The idea is we wanted to encourage banks to lend in the pandemic shutdown. And the Fed indicated when it left those exemptions, laps, that it would begin, it would review whether or not it made sense to include treasury reserves in that leverage calculation. I'm sure that analysis is ongoing, but I think that's certainly something worth serious study. What is the rationale, actually, for the SLR? I don't not sure I understand it because I would think the treasure is close to risk free as possible. You know, the history of this is before the GFC, David, we had risk-based standards for banks. And so, treasuries are not risky, other bonds are more risky. There was a sense broadly in the global community, not just in the U.S., but through the Basel process in Europe and Asia, central bank and policymakers agreed that it made sense to have a supplementary leverage ratio that typically would not be binding most of the time, but it could prevent, if you will, financial institutions from gaming and entirely risk-based system. However, you know, we discovered in March of 2020, the banks were in great shape. The banks were part of the solution, not part of the problem. And there can be perverse consequences of having a supplementary leverage ratio, especially when central banks are doing large amounts of key leak. Is the creating reserves, which the system has to absorb? So I think it's certainly something that Fed could address, and I think it could make a lot of sense. Rich, thank you so much for being on Wall Street Week. I hope you'll come back often. It's really good to have you, Richard Claret of PIMCO.

Over the past few decades they've gotten way more powerful, long lasting and affordable. But all of this is just a prologue to what the next batteries are going to do. As we drive to an increasingly renewable power driven grid, we also need to be able to store energy and release it later to cover those periods of weather intermittencies that are driving this new grid that we're in. It's a multi trillion dollar opportunity and it's imperative that we figure out the solution here. How we store energy on a massive scale is in many ways the central challenge of the fight to stop climate change.

Larry thank you so much for being back with us. A lot of us spent a lot of the week trying to figure out where the Fed is headed, particularly where the terminal rate is. We got conflicting answers out of the Fed including with Mr. Bullard, the Fed president saying well five, five and a quarter and then put up a chart using the Taylor rule that suggested seven. Where are we? Look no one knows, I think it's a mistake to be slavish about Taylor rules. The market thinks the number is going to be about five. I look at things and my sense is there's more room for that to be too low than there is for that to be too high. But it's pretty clear that we've had the big moves on this cycle and now we're going to be finishing that process off. My view is that there's more risk from stopping prematurely and not really curing inflation and setting the stage up for a re-exceleration of inflation after it comes down. I see that as a bigger risk than going too far because going too far would mean bringing inflation down below 2%, and that still seems to me like an awfully remote risk starting from where we are. But I think that the Fed has this in the right place when it says that they're going to move up somewhat more and they're going to take stock of the situation and see what the inflation data is saying and seeing what the inflation forecasts are saying when we get to the spring of next fall, winter rather spring of next year, I have to say that if they hadn't made as many mistakes as they did of excessive optimism about inflation, they probably have a little more room than they do to rely on forecasts that hadn't yet proved out that inflation was going to come down.

18289," I'm going to come down. Larry, you and I talk a lot about monetary policy, even fiscal stimulus and things, but geopolitics have also factored increasingly in some of the issues having to do with the economy. This week we had what is potentially, we don't know if it is, an important development in the meeting of President Xi of China and President Biden. What do you make of those discussions? And even ongoing discussions, because now we have the USTR, a madam tie actually meeting with her counterpart. What do you make of the situation with China right now in the United States? Look, as Churchill famously said, George Aught is a lot better than BangBang. And so the fact that they had a meaningful conversation that lasted more than three hours, the fact that they both came out of the conversation with the sense that there had been satisfying dialogue, the sense that there are some follow-on steps. I think that's all to the good. What it's really going to mean, what really is going to happen? Is there going to be constructive movement out of those dialogues? I think that's something we're going to have to wait and see. But I'm encouraged by what I saw. And I think it means that President Biden's whole trip has to be regarded as a success. The United States back in the game with respect to climate in Shammel Shake, the meeting with Xi. I don't think this G20 will be long remembered, but at a very vexing moment, there could have been some kind of breakdown. And there certainly was not that. Well, as a minimal thing, I've read some places, people say, at least there is a G20. I mean, they came out with a joint communique, and it was fairly tough on Russia, I think it's fair to say. And the reporting behind the scenes are, is that some of the developing countries like Indonesia and India helped drive that process, which might, I don't want to overread it, suggest that maybe we're taking a half step back toward multilateralism? I think things, I think we are. I think that what Russia has done has really shocked the conscience of the world and has affected very, very many countries. We'll have to see how this plays out. I think we need to remain aware that in the original vote in the UN General Assembly, there were countries with more than half the world's population who abstained onto Russia's side, who declined to join in condemning Russia. So I think we've got a lot of work to do, and we in the United States tend to be a bit over optimistic about the extent to which all others see us as the, in the benign way that we see ourselves. It's such an important point, and it takes me back, at least, to China, because it seems to me that sometimes we've been overly optimistic. I mean, for example, going back to the time we admitted into the WTO, we thought China was going to become more like us, and then we go over the other extreme of being, perhaps, overly pessimistic about China. I guess my question for you is former Treasury Secretary among other things. How do we play both sides of that? We don't know how it will end up. How do we keep open the realistic possibility we can really work closely with China, but also protect ourselves against the possibility of confrontation? We in the United States probably need to be careful about our evangelizing influence. I don't think it's really for us to tell China how they should organize their entire society. I think it's for us to stand up for some of our fundamental interests in security, in fair economic competition, but to leave it at that point. I think we're going to need to be very careful with respect to our diplomacy on the issue of Taiwan. I think we need to be very careful about giving China the sense that we are trying to change the traditional one China.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,903,2022-11-19 15:49:55
18290," Be very careful about giving China the sense that we are trying to change the traditional one-shina policy, because I think that could risk disaster conflict. So I think the operative words for us need to be respect for them, respect for positions and the fundamental interests that they have. And at same time, absolute insistence on our own. And I would say one other thing, David, I think ultimately we will prevail in this broad contest with China. But I think if and when we prevail, it is going to be more than anything else on the strength of our example. And that's why domestic renewal at home, whether the issue is scientific innovation or infrastructure, whether the issue is doing something about opiate deaths or whether the issue is strengthening our education system, whether the issue is building on the greatness of our universities or the greatness of our national parks. And ultimately, it's going to be our ability to remain the country that's the envy of the world, the country to which people want to come that is going to determine our success. And if we change our focus from building ourselves up to tearing China down, I think we will be making a very risky and very unfortunate choice. Larry, I want to make a very large turn here. I've had the benefit of talking to you about the masters, about basketball, I want to talk to about Taylor Swift. She's a rather popular pop music star. And ticket master because we now know the Department of Justice is investigating possible antitrust problems there because of ticket master, which does after I'll have a 70% market share that's been under investigation for some time. I don't know if you know much about Tyler Swift, although I am concerned about you getting tickets, which apparently seems to be difficult. But more broadly, what is it say perhaps about some of the problems with over-concentration in the economy? You know, I want to say two things about that, David. The first is that if the government made a website that functioned as badly as ticket masters has here, everybody would be laughing and scorning the government. And so the next time the private sector says that, you know, the public sector can't do anything right, this was a private sector building a website, sort of like they had to build a website for Obamacare, sort of like they have to build websites at the IRS, or like they have to build a build websites for student loan debt relief. And the private sector utterly failed. And that's something that we just have to remember the next time somebody wants to say everything about government is hopeless. Yeah, we are a lot of money. We have to trust. Yeah, Larry, we're going to have to leave it there. I'm so sorry. We're a humble. We have much to be humble about. Larry, thank you so very much. That's Larry. Some of us are a very special contributor here on Wall Street Week. Coming up, a lot of people get hurt when there's a collapse like that of FTX, but who stands to benefit? That's next on Wall Street Week on Bloomberg. // Every Friday with 30 minutes dedicated to fixed income, I'm Jonathan Ferro this, W tank robot.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,904,2022-11-19 15:54:24
18291," Every Friday with 30 minutes dedicated to fixed income, I'm Jonathan Ferro this is my burglar yield. Japan's critical role in the global economy is changing as the world recalibrates. After decades of stagnation, Japan's leaders are forging a more innovative and sustainable path forward to revitalize the nation. Corporate giants, policymakers and pioneers tell us how they're doing just that. Every week on Japan ahead, right here on Bloomberg Television. Finally, one more thought. If Tom Brady's for it, it's got to be good, right? I'm getting into crypto. With FTX, you're in? Despite that endorsement from the greatest quarterback of all time, the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX has brought heartbreak to a lot of people. Wiping out in one fell swoop, what was estimated to be a $32 billion empire, leaving what its lawyers now say could be as many as a million creditors holding the bag. And by the way, triggering a class action lawsuit against Tom Brady and others paid to tout FTX to the world. The ripple effects of FTX and the rest of the Sam Bankman-Fried's empire now beginning here as we wait for bankruptcy proceedings. All of which has shaken the confidence of many investors, that's according to Citadel's Ken Griffin. FTX is one of these absolute travesties in the history of financial markets. We're going to lose billions of dollars, and that undermines trust in all financial markets. But as bad as the FTX collapse may be, it's only the latest in a series of major meltdowns we've seen in recent years. Just think back to 2001, when that mythical energy giant Enron hit the skids. Its former CEO, Jeff Skilling, reflected back on the loss in his later testimony before Congress. I am devastated by an apologetic about what Enron has come to represent. No words can make things right. Too many people have been hurt too much. Or World Com. The telecommunications phenom of the late 90s that followed Enron into bankruptcy in 2002, wiping out a market cap of $186 billion and sending its former CEO Bernie Ebers to prison, despite his trying to seek protection behind the Fifth Amendment. I've been instructed by my counsel not to testify based on my Fifth Amendment constitutional rights. Or that emblem of the first internet bubble, pets.com with that cute sock puppet mascot, which was an instant market hit when it went public. And just as quickly went flop. All of these notorious failures shared a bold vision, a confident leader, and a belief that they'd come up with a better mouse trap, just like Mr. Bankman freed. And if FTX follows the pattern, it will share one other thing with colossal failures through the years. A lot of lawyers making a lot of money despite all the carnage. When Enron went into bankruptcy, it had assets of over $65 billion. In the ultimate resolution, shareholders were wiped out at a loss of $74 billion. The lawyers, they walked away with over $1 billion along with the accounts. World Com was three times as big, losing investors in estimated $175 billion. While the lawyers were making over $10 million a month in a proceeding to last it well over a year. Lehman was forced into bankruptcy amid one of the most turbulent periods in our economic history, which culminated in a catastrophic crisis of confidence and a run on the bank. But those were all small potatoes compared with Lehman, a bankruptcy that wiped out between $46 billion and $63 billion according to the New York Fed, and netted the lawyers and other consultants a cool, get this $6 billion. So we'll see how much the FTX creditors end up writing off, much less the token holders as much as clouds.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,905,2022-11-19 15:58:36

Back in 1997, I was interested in the following question, which is there are a bunch of the dinosaurs called sauropod dinosaurs, which had really long skinny necks, so apodosaurus is an example. Now, there's really long skinny tails. So I made a computer model that showed that in fact the tail of these sauropod dinosaurs could actually act like a whip, a bullfip. Now the way a bullfip makes that cracking noise is because the tip of the whip actually goes about twice the speed of sound. And that crack is a sonic boom. I think the way they got a date was to impress the females by making loud booms. Hello! Good! How are you? It's so great to see you. Thank you so much for doing this. What do you think about all this love's getting into? Crypto-like. I think that that I think was more last year. I think it's kind of a way of that past. No, I don't think so, but I think it's like any time that frankly it's when a lot of other people get into crypto, right? Other audiences too. It's when it's in the news a lot. And when does that happen? A lot of times when the prices are going up. She was a federal prosecutor going after gangs and the mob before being handed her next assignment, taking down Bitcoin. Kiti Han soon realized this new technology was much more than a tool used by criminals. She dove deep and became a crypto convert, swapping her prosecutor hat for a board seat at Coinbase, and became the first female general partner at venture firm and recent Horowitz. Han, now a prolific crypto investor, recently launched her own fund with one and a half billion dollars to deploy. It's the largest fund ever raised by a single investor joining me on this edition of Bloomberg Studio 1.0 CEO and founder of Han Ventures, Kiti Han.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,906,2022-11-19 16:03:16
18293," Joining me on this edition of Bloomberg Studio 1.0 CEO and founder of Han Ventures, Katie Han. Katie, it's so great to have you. Great to be back here in the studio with you Emily. I want to start with a vibe check. Okay. What state of the crypto cycle are we in right now? It was hot. Yep. And then it got pretty cold. Well look Emily, zooming back because I've been in crypto for a decade if you can believe it. We've seen crypto be really hot and then all of a sudden not. And so we've seen this before. However, I think one of the things that's a little bit different now is with each new crypto cycle, more and more people come into it. And so it's more and more pronounced each cycle. And I would push back on it's not. I think it depends on what area of the ecosystem you're looking at. We think developers think crypto and Web3 is still really hot. I am seeing a lot less of those. We're all going to make it hashtags. I'm seeing a lot less of them too. Although I am spending less time on Twitter. So maybe that's why. But with each cycle, there are there are new acronyms. What hasn't happened is a crypto winter in the midst of kind of really serious global macro conditions. So we have inflation kind of at record highs for our generation in our lifetime. And then we have also a war that's broken out in the Ukraine. And we have a number of other factors going on here. So that's very different. There was some serious carnage out there. Socius, Luna, three hours. What's been your takeaways from all of that? I don't want to sit here and tell you that algorithmic stablecoins are bad because I actually think they're really interesting. However, I think what happened is you had, in this case you mentioned Luna and Tara, you know, that was an algorithmic stablecoin that was getting pretty widespread adoption relative to what the tech could do. I didn't realize you spent your teenage years living in Egypt and learning Arabic. Tell me about your upbringing. I was always uprooted. My dad worked for a large company and we were always moving just when I would get comfortable in one space. And I think actually that's pretty important. If you fast-forward and look at my career, I'm comfortable being in uncomfortable situations. I didn't know a lot about venture when I got into it initially. I didn't know a lot about crypto when I got into it initially. And I was okay asking questions. I was okay not knowing the local acronyms or the Naman creature of a particular field. And I'm, you know, I'm taken right back to my teenage years in Cairo, moving from Houston, Texas one day to downtown Maddie in Cairo the next day. You studied law. I did. You clerked for Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy. That's right. You became a federal prosecutor. You were taking on prison gangs and the mafia. That must have taken a really thick skin. I was doing it at each 25. And now if I kind of take a step back and you I think that happens at different points in your career. Like, whoa, if I would have analyzed that a little more at the time. And I'm kind of in some ways glad I didn't. I just dove right in because I found it fascinating. There was a human aspect to it and people's stories. And I felt like those stories mattered. So I was drawn to criminal law and became a federal prosecutor. And I did cases involving violent crime, but then really mistriing cases, being back in the courtroom, being before the grand jury. Like the prosecutor you would see on TV going to try those murder cases. Doing those two hour closing arguments. That's right. And so moved out here to California. I invited the largest prison gang in the world at the time. I'll law motorcycle gangs hostage taking bank robberies, armed bank robberies. There was really not a kind of criminal case by that point in my career. I hadn't done it. It was right around that time. 2012. One of my bosses came in and said, let's have that same energy that you brought to those gang cases to those murder cases. And let's go ahead and have you investigate this new criminal technology that we really need to look into and possibly shut this down. So you created the first cryptocurrency task force. How would you describe it? Fortunately, several of us in the government realized at the time it's not possible, also not desirable because Bitcoin is not an entity. It's not a person. Right, it's a protocol. And it would be like saying, let's go shut down cash. Let's go shut down the internet. It's not possible. Probably wouldn't be a good idea either. I was",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,907,2022-11-19 16:07:17
18294," Right, it's a protocol. And it would be like saying, let's go shut down cash. Let's go shut down the internet. It's not possible. Probably wouldn't be a good idea, either. I was using crypto and technologies like the Bitcoin blockchain, because that's all that existed then, this is 2012, 2013, to actually uncover criminal activity. So I didn't think that that technology was bad. Frankly, it was a tool that helped me uncover the various activity. And by the way, it was a step level function improvement better than compliance by banks. I'll just go ahead and say it. That's a little bit controversial. But I had spent a decade subpoenaing large financial institutions. And five times out of 10 didn't get back what I needed. One case I worked on, and people always say, oh, you shut down the Silk Road. What actually happened? I was looking into something completely, not having to do with anything at all of the Silk Road, and came across some, what looked to be some kind of odd activity. And it turns out that a couple of federal agents on the Silk Road Task Force out of Washington, DC, were cropped. And that is the case that I ended up in dining. And I ended up prosecuting those agents, and they both went to prison. So that's the aspect of what Silk Road case that I worked on. I would never, never have been able to uncover that criminal activity by those agents, because they were federal agents, they knew how to cover their tracks had they not used Bitcoin blockchain. So that technology right there, if they had just used wires or cash or bank wires, we would never have uncovered that. Just how hard is it to launch a crypto fund to subscribe? One covers the world like Bloomberg. Writing's on the wall for the bank of England. Just stock oil has spray painted the front door. Recession in Europe, UK, and possibly the US. The people who are out in full force celebrating the election victory of former president, Lula, that's the only thing. With unmatched reach in resources from more than 120 countries, the moment news breaks 24 hours a day. Bloomberg, your global business authority. Big, expensive cities have a lot going for them. But if you live in one, you've probably noticed that these big, expensive cities keep getting more, well, expensive. You could always move away. You might have just started working remotely, so there's really nothing keeping you there. But then again, moving is a hassle. Well, what if someone paid you 10 grand to do it? What if they threw in free office space, a bicycle, or a gym membership? Programs and cities and states around the US are doing exactly that. And they're getting a lot of interest. We've had over 50,000 applications. About 90,000 applications. We've had over 1800 applicants from all over North America. So are these nascent programs actually beneficial to their communities and the workers joining them? Or are they little more than flashy advertising campaigns for places looking for an injection of fresh talent? So you became kind of a crypto convert after this. You joined the board of coinbase. That's right. Very early on. How did you and coinbase and Brian Armstrong come together? I hosted an event here in San Francisco at the Federal Reserve Bank. And I believe it was there that it wasn't just Brian. It was a lot of what I'll call legitimate actors and crypto who wanted to usher in this new wave, this new ecosystem. And then we brought together the heads of all kinds of agencies. Really in an effort to kind of talk about building bridges. The government and the crypto industry were never going to see eye to eye on a lot of things. But we did think there were some commonalities. Coinbase is a company that has suffered. They've been losing share. The valuation of the public markets has plummeted. Why do you think that is? And how do you think it can be fixed? Yeah. Well, I think again, a few things it's tied to. One, a large aspect of Coinbase's business now, of course, is trading revenue. And that's down when prices are down. And the company's been very transparent about that long before going public. I mean, also, if you look at its S1, it specifically identifies that. And just how volatile crypto is that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,908,2022-11-19 16:11:39
18295," Companies have been very transparent about that long before going public. I mean, also if you look at its S1, it specifically identifies that. And just how volatile crypto cycles are. So I think that's part of it. It's judged by public markets as a technology stock, or as a financial services company. By the way, I think it's both. I think it's not just a financial services company. I think it's so much more. I think it's really a portal to this whole new ecosystem. You were also on the board of OpenC until recently there's an insider trading situation or accusation going on there. Coinbase has also had employees accused of insider trading. How much is this happening within crypto companies and within the industry and how big a problem is? Yeah, I think crypto is under the microscope. So where you have a case, two cases, three cases in crypto ecosystem, which now is a trillion dollar industry. I think multi-billion approaching trillion dollar industry, you're always going to be able to find examples like that. So I don't want to make too much out of a handful of cases. That said, the company, Coinbase, OpenC, take these things incredibly seriously. Along with your position at Coinbase, you became a partner at one of the most storied venture capital for Silicon Valley. Like, Alexandria's in Horowitz. What was your experience at A16Z-like? There I met Chris Dixon, and I met Ben Horowitz, and I met Mark Andreessen. And I had worked with them for just about a year, maybe a little bit over when they asked me to come and co-run their crypto funds at Andreessen Horowitz. Again, I jumped at that chance, and I think really that speaks to the fact that, as I've said before, things are a hell yes or there are no. And it was a hell yes for me. So, Andreessen Horowitz is the kind of place where if you make a partner, you don't leave. Yeah. How did Mark and Ben respond when you said, you want to leave to start a crypto fund? As you might know, Emily, they're an anchor. They're an anchor check into my fund. And I'm very grateful for that. Mark and Chris and folks like them are also personal LPs. So, I felt very supported when I shared that decision. And I will say that it was not running away from Andreessen Horowitz. It was running to another opportunity. And, you know, crypto is not, what did they say? It's not a spectator sport. It's like, you're in it. It's very young. It's 24-7. It's global. And it's hustle. And that's a trade-off. It's a life trade-off. And at this point in my career and in my life, if I was going to continue to make that trade-off, I just wanted to do it and do it in a way that was really true to me. So, you struck out on your own to launch on ventures. What gave you the courage to do that? What was the spark that lit the fire? Yeah. That got you to say, I need to do this and do this now. Sure. What I set out to do was to continue to invest in this ecosystem that I think is so broad that decision was very purposeful. And the timing was very purposeful. We have an early stage fund that does seed stage, series A, even series B. And then we have what we call an acceleration fund, which is not a growth fund. It's a crypto growth fund. And I think those are different things. But it's later stage. It might be crypto-publics. Certain kinds of public tokens were set up to hold tokens and participate in the token ecosystem. Or later stage companies. I mean, you know, there are now several crypto, many crypto unicorns. The space has become really competitive. Even though you say, you know, crypto has had its kind of ups and downs. The thing is, a lot of people in some of those last cycles have seen the kind of venture style returns that can be having crypto. And so you've had a lot of new funds enter the space. And that's driven up competition. So what differentiates on ventures then from, you know, all of these other crypto funds, or even the more traditional venture capitalists, like entries in Harrowitz or Sequoia, they also have crypto funds. Sure. Well, I think a lot of traditional venture capital funds now have crypto funds. It used to just be like a regulatory designation. It was like, are you an RIA, which is registered investment advisor? I would say for crypto founders today, it's not enough to just be an RIA, right? They, frankly, I don't even know if a lot of them care. That's a regulatory designation. What crypto founders today want to know is, do you live and breathe crypto? Do you inhale the discourse? Are you part of the community? Do you participate in governance? Are you going to be staking these kind of crypto verbs out there? And if you're not really in this space full time, I think it's very hard to run a successful crypto fund.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,909,2022-11-19 16:16:03
18296," These kind of crypto verbs out there. And if you're not really in this space full time, I think it's very hard to run a successful crypto fund. We don't have a hedge fund component. So we're not sitting here buying and trading and selling. That's a hedge fund structure. And there are crypto hedge funds. We're not one. We're making seven to 10 year bets. Just how hard is it to launch a crypto fund from scratch? You know, it's hard, but it's not impossible. We don't have a crystal ball. I don't know. I can't predict cycles. But I knew that we were in a cycle where you saw so much further an excitement around the space. And I already talked about what makes this different. But I think one thing also is we are a nimble strike force. We don't fish in the same pond. We have the crypto natives. We have a fish and execution. We have operators, seasoned operators, who really know how to stick the landing. And I think that's reflected on our culture. I would say the only thing that's changed in our strategy as a result of the market correction is really more of a focus on early stage. But we still have our late stage fund. And when we see valuations, which I think will still see correct, spoiler. I think we'll continue to see some corrections. And so we might deploy our later stage fund a little bit more slowly. It might not be on an even 50-50 cadence. And that's OK. Long-term, our strategy hasn't changed. Long-term, we're committed to this space. How much do you think valuations are going to correct? You know, it's just, I can't give you a one-size-fits-all answer because crypto is not a monolith. You have some crypto companies that really follow more of an enterprise-sass business model. You have others that are layer one protocols. You have still others that are consumer-facing applications. And I think one of the things we're seeing right now is the infrastructure layer. And that's where we're spending a lot of our time, by the way. And we think more and more use cases will come about when the infrastructure layers in place. So my own view is we are not rushing to deploy. We're certainly not getting caught up. Do you get VC FOMO? I try not to avoid that. You know, look, I think it's very easy to get into that mindset, right? It's because it's a competitive sport. It's a competitive space. And I think, I'd be lying if I said that that doesn't influence anyone. What I do, and I think I do differently, is I try to take stock of that. Oh, that's the FOMO mentality kicking in. That's bad. Again, you don't want to over-correct, though. What we look for is we look for amazing founders. It doesn't matter if I think valuations will correct if they're amazing founders. There's a huge tam. We also look for what's your regulatory plan? If you're launching a token, what's your plan to comply with the law? What's your plan for security, by the way? We've seen a lot of hacks in the space. We want to really dive in there and make sure that the founders have been thoughtful about, especially if they're costating customer funds, keeping those funds secure. If it's a cross-chain bridge, what are the exploits? Have you changed your strategy at all, given the downturn? What? Have you backed out of any deals or decided not to do certain deals? Because the conditions have changed. Don't you raise the phone? We have decided not to do certain deals. We've never backed out of a deal. We have decided not to do a few deals. Because we think that pricing was ahead of progress candidly. And we might have been wrong about that, Emily. We might have been wrong about that. But I think if we were wrong not to do a couple of deals, better that we might have been right. Because if we were wrong about that, I think we can find a way to still invest in those projects later. Well, one thing I'm hearing is that a lot of dry powder has just sacked up. Because all these funds raised a lot of money. Yeah. Raised the biggest fund ever for a single person, not just a woman. Yeah. Anyone? Are you confident you're going to have a place to put all that money? I am. But if I don't have a place to put it, I'm not just going to go willing, nearly deploy it. One of the things that we told our LPs, even during that period when we raised our fund, which was when crypto was undeniably still on a bull run, we said that we are going to be pretty steadfast, sticking to a tier deployment cycle. And I think one thing that's changed is that might have lengthened. It certainly hasn't shortened. But we will, again, we feel very good that we have the capital to back great teams when we see them. So you think we're going to fall behind the United States? I think we already are falling behind. Fall behind. And we're falling behind.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,910,2022-11-19 16:20:25
18297," Thanks for watching, guys! I'm sorry. You've got to explain this one to me. What does it mean when the White House says we're watching markets carefully? It means they have a Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. They have. I've been in and seen it. Lots of Bloombergs. Lots of Bloombergs. Lots of Bloombergs. Lots of Bloombergs. Lots of Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. What does it mean? What does it mean? What does it mean? What does it mean? It means they have a Bloomberg. What about NFTs? NFTs? Are you concerned about the declining demand? We are going to increasingly live in a digital world. And I happen to think that if you live in a digital world, you're going to want to own digital goods in that world. You're not just going to be satisfied to rent them, which is what we do now. We buy our content from walled gardens without digital scarcity, which is what? NFTs unlock. You don't really own anything. You're subject to the whims of a platform. And I think NFTs and digitally scarce goods fundamentally change that. I think you'll see NFTs back again. But we are spending a lot of time in the infrastructure layer. Like I tell you, zero-knowledge, technology, scalability. We think of that as the plumbing. If you think of the fiber-hubtic cables. Remember, you couldn't have had YouTube and Netflix with dial-up. You couldn't have streamed content. The same is true of crypto use cases. We think that there will be a lot of new use cases unlocked when the infrastructure is there, when it's more efficient, when it's more user-friendly. And so we're spending a lot of our time there. President Biden issues this crypto executive order. There are a number of ports that are coming due. What do you want to see from the administration when it comes to regulation? Are you optimistic that we will get there? Yeah. We were so delighted to see that executive order. It's not something you should normally be delighted about. But why we were is because it was to us a real recognition that this is a US government saying this field isn't going anywhere. This field is growing. It's growing so much that we are going to direct every single agency in the federal government to come up with a plan here. I think we take a step forward, but then you see we're a big government. We're a big system. We have states. We have local entities. So we take a step forward with the EO. And then we take some steps back sometimes too. And I think what I see as crypto founders are confused by that. They're starting to think, well, I could go to this jurisdiction where there's a single regulator. And you don't have 50 states with different rules. It's the US government that needs to start taking stock of the fact that right now, Emily in China, there's a quarter of a billion, ECNY wallets, a quarter of a billion. We're still talking about whether there should be a government central bank digital currency. We're still studying that. So you think we're going to fall behind the United States? I think we already are falling behind. Fall behind China. And we're falling behind. What are the dangers of falling behind China and the rest of the world? This is years ahead. So I don't want people to take a headline and say, oh, I think the US dollar will be no longer the global currency, reserve global currency. I'm not saying that now. But fast forward decades. And if you no longer need to use the dollar because you have an alternative, I think that's a real problem. What would we use instead? Well, I think that there are going to be stable coins out there that people who have access to a smartphone will use. There is a demand for it. We see 285% of your growth with stable coins. So people are clearly liking the idea of this. Now, again, there have been some spectacular failures too, but not all stable coins are created the same. But I think the important thing is that we really do need to not just quash innovation. What do you think of how Gary Gensler, the chair,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,911,2022-11-19 16:24:59
18298," They're failures too, but not all stable coins are created the same. But I think the important thing is that we really do need to not just quash innovation. What do you think of how Gary Gensler, the chair of the SEC, and how he's approaching it? One of the things that I hear from founders is that they're very confused, because they get told, come in, register, just come in and talk to us. But you have the one company who's done the ultimate act of going in and registering. Coinbase, File the S1, and still, you know, there's a lot of saber rattling still going on, I think. And again, I don't want to single out the SEC, you know, and I don't want to suggest that anything they're doing is bad. I do think though that right now there's a lot of confusion. And one of the pieces of confusion stems from the fact that, you know, and it started with the ICO, Mania, back in what 2016, 2017, I can't even remember which year now, where the SEC was very loud about securities. A lot of them were securities, but the space has changed. And so to still view it through the ICO lens, when so much has happened over the last five years in the space, I think is a mistake. What do you have to say to the skeptics out there who just don't believe in the future of Web3? And don't see where this is going. I would say don't judge the current state of innovation by the end state of innovation. I hear from a lot of these skeptics, and by the way, I'm friends with a lot of these skeptics too. I don't only want to live in a crypto bubble, they want to see the use cases. Especially if they're not technical. Well, when am I going to use it? What will I use it for? And I think one of the things that's not appreciated is how quickly the infrastructure here is catching up. And once you have kind of a, once you have really scalable blockchains that can handle a lot of throughput and are very efficient, I think that unlocks a whole lot of use cases. People are spending more time on screens. That curve is up and to the right. And we like it or not, that is the future. I mean, those who have kids know that kids spend more time online. They want digital things too. And I think to dismiss it, it is a bit generational. I do find not always, but it is a bit generational. If you talk to kids about being able to have money online, they instantly get that concept. They're comfortable not having to hold something in their hand to think it has value. Take us to the end state. Do Google and Amazon and Facebook and Apple still exist? I believe they will still exist. I mean, it depends what you talk about when you talk about the end state. I mean, I think that, you know, I think for decades, those companies will still be around. But the important thing is I think this new ecosystem is going to represent a challenge to them. I do think that those entities, decentralized forces are coming and will cut into those entities, profits and revenues. So we have a little rapid fire section. If you could belong to any altcoin tribe, that would be gosh. There is no way I'm answering that because I will get trolled on Twitter by every other altcoin tribe. I'm a crypto maximalist. I'm a crypto maximalist. All right. Well, I'm not picking one. Booker podcaster, Benjing now. Yeah. Okay. I'm, I, yes, I am. Oh gosh, I'm Benjing on wheat crashed. Something that brings you simple joy. You know, one of the things that I love and I've missed being away from this summer is swimming. I just love, I find like some of my best thoughts come to me while I'm moving. Career philosophy. Yeah. Do a job where you know 50% of the job and where you're going to learn 50% of the job.

And so I'm very lucky to have a team who are as passionate and I can call my team, I can call somebody at 6 a.m. or they can call me at 6 a.m. and I'll pick up and they'll pick up. So we have something very special that we've built over the past five years. But there were difficult moments, right? I think the first time one of your first issues, you thought that you could have been fired for it. Oh, just that, right? I lived in America for a bit and I was working for W Magazine and there was talk of Brexit and of course Americans were like your country's really xenophobic. So I came back and I thought, you know, I'm going to be welcome with open arms and they're going to love me and oh my god, literally back to them by fire. But I remember thinking, you know, I wanted to create a magazine where every woman could see themselves. You know, where every woman regardless of the backgrounds, regardless of their age could just literally see themselves. And at the time, now it looks like it's the norm when you look at other magazines, but in 2017, that was a radical idea. But I also remember thinking, you know, with my background, you know, I've lost so much and gained so much that I thought, if I'd loo, if I'm fired, I'd rather be fired for what I believed in. I'd rather be fired for creating a magazine that reflected the world as it was than try to sort of create a second rate version of someone's vision. And that continues. I mean, there's this idea of always pushing forward. Yeah. Right? What's the end? How do you measure success? How do I measure success? I'm definitely not financial. I mean, I think it's more about, for me, when I'm really exhausted, when I'm really tired, when I'm really questioning if I can go on, you know, I walk on the street and I see a little girl, a little black girl who's seen the magazine and it's the norm for them or a curvy woman on a traitor palace, who's like, thank you for, you know, seeing me, you know, that makes it worth, like that for me a success. And anybody who knows or have known me for a while will witness that that for me a success, you know, my job is done when that happens. Do you think people come up to you? They do, but it's always, it's always in a positive way. It's always thank you for seeing us, you know. But I can relate because, like, as I said to you know, by all accounts, I was meant to be invisible, you know. So for me, shining in light on people and making them seen, it's natural for me. They say that the fashion industry is changing. You're changing it. Are others around you changing it? I mean, now, you know, you look at other magazines and seeing real women in there, it's no longer a radical act. Seem, you know, people of color, women of color on covers is no longer a radical act. So it's been normalized, you know, it's been normalized. And for me, I'm quite happy when I see that. You know, when you put Dame Judy Dengue on the cover, and she's 85 years old, and the world just laughed it. Yeah, nobody questioned her, you know, should she be on the cover or you put, you know, a girl with a hijab on the cover. And it's not a problem. That for me shows that, you know, we're advancing, we're progressing. So, you know, progress for me is very important. Which is important. And so how do you take care of your team? How do you build a team around you? I mean, somebody said to me once, when you build a team, make sure you employ people, you like people. When you see them working towards your office, you're just so excited to see. That was it. Being good at your job and sort of a connection. And being excited to see, you know, team members, because you only have good as your team. You know, no man is an island. You know, I don't create the magazine on my own. And so it's great to have a team who, you respect and who's views you respect, you know, and who respect yours. How do you think you're seen by your team? Do you have to be fearful? Do you have to be also terrible? I mean, I'm a worker, I work very hard. But I think I'm pretty open. You can have conversations with me.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,914,2022-11-19 16:37:42
18301," I'm going to carry on. I mean, I'm a worker. I work very hard. But I think I'm pretty open. You can have conversations with me. Ultimately, the final decision rests with me. But I do listen. I like conversation. I like interaction. And so that's how I hope they think I'm a good boss. And that's really all you can hope for. Because they work on a very good magazine. They can get other jobs anywhere. So the fact that they have there makes me think that they must be happy. Edward, how do you see the publishing world changing? So people buy less magazines. You've been doing pretty well in terms of selling more. But in five years, how does it look? I mean, I was five years ago. Let's go back to ID when I was 18. I heard it at a magazine, which would come out. I was all about club kids. And you had to be out there. And the only way you could see street fashion was through ID. And then 2017, I inherited a magazine. But now I oversee a brand. The magazine is so that the magazine is sort of the highest, sort of the high, the best paper, the best photographers, the best cultural messages. But at the moment, when you manage a brand, it's not just about that. It's about digital. It's about video. It's about audio. It's about events. So for somebody who's so forward looking, it's so great for me. And people always ask, oh, it's a magazine instead. When we launch a cover, Instagram is our cover, essentially. So we find a way of sort of making it work hand in hand. And it's so great for me. I think how do I just been doing the magazine? I probably would have been bored. So magazines aren't dead? Are they going to go down? Yeah, but they're going to work in hand with digital platforms. But also, I'll tell you something. New readers of old, young readers don't necessarily come to us through the new stands. They come through that did they sell platforms or audio, videos we put out. So yes, now it's increased 10 folds. Well, do you think that will change the kind of readership that you will court, the either age of your readers, but also where they come from? Yes, I mean, at the moment, I think the readership is getting younger because of the whole digital landscape. And I hope that as we move forward, it kind of, yeah, we have new readers. And we also keep our loyal readers. Do you think there's ever a time where actually we won't have print magazines anymore? No, I think print will always exist, sort of a long-side digital. But it'll probably be something more precious, better paper, something more collectible that you want to keep in your house, almost like artwork. So no, I don't think print is going to die. So fewer copies. See a copy, but more quality. But more quality. Better quality, you know. Almost like a book. A cable book. I love that. I need to see it. The We will never know.

Visit Bloomberg.com webinars. Welcome to the world of decentralized finance, Bloomberg's covering all things crypto, the people, the transactions, and the technology. Bloomberg Crypto Tuesdays. You're recently on TikTok. Yes. Is that fun? I'm so much fun. I literally have to be held back. The brilliant thing is I'm so curious. I mean, I like all the digital platforms. I really like to keep my finger on the pulse. I'm not one of those people that leaves work and shuts themselves in. I really want to be out there seeing the world as today. It's in all its beauty. I'm very curious. I have a very curious mind and I'm glad. I'm glad. It keeps everything moving and exciting. Is that for Gen Z? Is that a commercial purpose to get closer to that? No, it's just out of curiosity. I've always been like that. I've always wanted to know what's next. I didn't want to be the one that's just being told, oh, you're 50 or whatever. I pay attention to everything. But the world is such a beautiful place for me. Any goes back to my childhood again. It will be your biggest challenge to grow the brand in the next five years. Because we still keep it relevant. We have such great digital traffic. Almost 6 million every month to British folk. But I'm really excited about overseeing the European voves as well. Spain, Italy, Germany and France and mentoring a whole new generation of editors. When there was this whole agmatization, the whole world thought there was a global view that was going to dominate. But it's very much about local conversations as well as global conversations. So I learned from these content leads and I hope that they also learned. So the local global conversation I'm very excited about moving into the future. Do you think it changes if we're in a recessionary environment? So you have such a glamorous lifestyle or what you sell is so glamorous. Is it impacted by the cost of living or inflation or what we can live through? I mean, you know, I remember a few years ago I put Taylor Swift on the cover and the byline was by better, by less. And it was a radical concept at the time. But now we all talk about sustainability. We know we can't keep shopping every day. We know we have to buy things that last things that help the planet, things that we can pass on to sort of our generation. So I think that really is a conversation on the fashion industry is having right now that I find so exciting. And it's going to be sort of, you know, people are going to have less money so they have to buy things that last. And I'm really excited. And these are real changes. It's not just real changes. It's not just conversation. It's actually happening. Do you think fashion brands always need to have a political point of view when they're great and justices? I think fashion brands can do more. I feel that having a black model in your show or having, you know, a feed on your Instagram post, it's not enough. We need diverse voices behind the scenes. I always say that I talk to sort of all the CEOs I know we need to employ more people from, you know, from diverse backgrounds because that's the only way you can even reach out to more people, you know. A variety of voices always better than just, just one. And I always also say, you know, let's not just have interns, let's have people in all different levels.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,916,2022-11-19 16:46:15
18303," Actually, your voice is always better than just one. And I always also say, let's not just have interns, let's have people on all different levels. And that's what I keep talking to people about. Do they listen? Some listen, but I think since George Floyd was murdered more and more companies sort of made pledges to people of color. And it's a slow process. Some have taken this seriously, and some are still working their way through it. But we have to keep on. The problem is that you can make a pledge, and then follow through. So you have to really focus and keep asking that question for people to follow through. And so do you feel like you're a guardian of also of that, of making sure that when you get promised something, they'll do it, and you'll hold them into account? Yes, if they promise something that I asked for, then I will literally wear you down. I'll literally chase you until you keep your promise. That's just who I am. We actually have one of the diverse cabinets here in the UK with Liz Truss. Is that important to you? It is so important as somebody who came from another country and was sort of welcomed by the UK. It's very important to have a diverse cabinet. That's how change happens. Going back to what we discussed before, that's how you understand people who are on the periphery or who've been avid. It's so important to have a diverse cabinet. But this you think in terms of policies and what they can bring to the table, or just also seeing how they can have a diverse cabinet. You can have an effect on policy. I hope they can have an effect on the parties themselves, as well as policy. For me, it's about policy that makes people's lives better. I know you're also very close to Ghana still. I mean, there's a pretty scandalous anti-LGBT bill getting through. I mean, it's so funny. I was invited back to Ghana a few years ago by the President. It was the year of the return. And I remember the last time we were in Ghana, we were fleeing. And I really supported the changes. I love the changes that we're going through. But yes, they do have an LGBT problem. Some friends and I signed a whole. I don't know if you saw it. And we're doing what we can to change things on the ground. I think you can't also sit in the West and tell a country what to do. So it's about forming alliances on the ground and seeing what is needed and how we can help. Rather than standing on our soap boxes, going, do this, do that, do this. So that's through what grounds, I mean, ground work, trying to change from with it? Yes, from with it. Yeah. Trying to change from with it, you know, talking to LGBTQ members and asking them what they need and what we can do to help. Rather than, you know, I'll say, do this. This is how you do it, because we don't live there. You have a memoir out. Yeah. Why put it down on paper? You know something about when you turn 50. What? When is your 50 year old, you know? I got married this year. I'm normally not someone who looks back all the time, but it felt like the right time for me to do that. And also, you know, I just felt that a lot of young people sort of see people like you and I. And they think, you know, we just got here. We were always here. And for me, it was really important to share the story of a journey about, you know, successors and, you know, failures. And, you know, that's the reason why I got here. So I just wanted to share that story with them. Sort of young people. That's what those people who, you know, feel like they're on the outskirts of, you know, the outside of the industry, really. Do you feel like an outsider? I think I always feel like an outsider. But I just said before, you know, I grew up African in an African household in England, you know, different languages, different foods. And I now go to school and I've been in England. So I've always been about duality. I've always seen myself as an outsider, but also an in.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,917,2022-11-19 16:50:40
18304," You know, different languages, different foods, and I'll now go to school and I've been in England. So I've always been about duality. I've always seen myself as an outsider, I've also an insider. And even when I took a job at British folk, I was the black gay working class outsider, but I'd been in the industry since I was 18. I was in essence an insider. That's really the duality that plays out in my life. Who do you think made you the person you are today? I know you left home twice, right, Ghana, but also you had to leave your home. Yes. I mean, the puzzle made me who I mean, really is my mother. I mean, I love my mother. She taught me about sort of beauty. She taught me about clothes, about fascism. She also taught me that beauty came in all forms, that women were beautiful, no matter what shape they were, no matter what color, what religion. So that really stayed with me. I guess my creativity comes from her. And of course, I also had a military father, so the idea of precision and organization and sort of thinking ahead also comes from him. So the best of both worlds. How did your father, I know you had a difficult relation with your father. How did your father shape the person you are today? It's so funny, I should ask this question because I never thought I was like my father growing up. I was very shy, very sensitive, you know, a little spacey. I prefer the company of women. To men, my dad was sort of, you know, a sort of a theory in disciplinarian. You know, you had to, you know, be home at a certain time. You know, he roared with an iron fist. And I thought, you know, I'm never going to be like, you know, he kicked me out of the house, you know, when I was 18. But I found out that over the years, when it comes to work and discipline and sort of organization, that is him to a T. You will put a woman on Mars. You will bring forth global cooling.

This is Bloomberg Daybreak with Lake. Welcome to Daybreak Australia. This is Hannah DeClos. Welcome to Bloomberg crypto. So at some point you lose your eyesight. What was that like? Yes. Basically I have very high myopia. I've never had great eyesight and I went through a series of sort of repnall detachments for to be exact. And with each detachment, I'll have to end up looking down in a contraption for about three weeks. And in the dark room, and it was very harrowing. It's very harrowing time in my life. But I always say, you know, you don't have to have vision to have vision. So in those dark rooms, my imagination was even bigger. I dreamt bigger. And I came out to sort of the last surgery and the cover I did was",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,918,2022-11-19 16:54:54
18305," So in those dark rooms my imagination was even bigger. I dream bigger and I came out of the last surgery and the cover I did was for W Magazine with Rihanna as the queen, with a golden eye. And I looked back at it and I thought, oh my god, there are their eyes. Some, some, some, some limitily. So, yes, it was very challenging. And even to this day, you know, I go for checkups to make sure my eyes are okay. They're great right now and you know, once the more I look after myself, the better, the better I'll get. But it's amazing, you power through adversity. Do you ever think actually this is too much? Have you ever thought this is too much? I mean, there have been times when I felt this is too much, but it's not in my vocabulary to start. It's not in my DNA to start. You know, I am my mother's son, my father's son. You know, the edge to move forward is always there. And that's why, you know, when I was young, I would always get up and work. I had a recklessly attachment. I still got on a plane to go shoot the Hollywood put folio. But now I'm learning to say no. Now I'm learning I can't do that job. I can't fly. No, it takes time, but it comes with age. It takes courage to say no, right? Absolutely. So when you look at all your covers and there's so many beautiful ones, is there one that's special to you? Well, I say to someone, they're like my children. We always have a favorite child. But I'm especially proud of the covers we did in lockdown, you know. When the world had essentially shut down, you know, the teams were sort of scattered all around London. And I had to go back to the days of I did when, you know, you had to really create user imagination. And we had a series of four covers, Judy Dinch. When they said, you know, anybody over 60, she stayed at home. The essential workers cover a cover of landscapes, just so people could take a breather. And the activists cover when George Floyd was murdered. And I really think we create covers that, you know, in years time people can look back and see what the time... That period was like for me, an artist's service has to reflect their times, to paraphrase Nina Simone, and that's really important for me. I mean, there was a bit of controversy with Linda Vanjolista. Yes. Yes, I mean, you know, there was a complaint that, oh, you know, she should... She should have looked a certain way, you know. And for me, I've no Linda in the 90s. I've known this incredible icon who really defined what a model should be. And I also saw my friend go through really dark days, you know, due to the complications for surgery. Literally disappear from the world, really not the Linda the world knew. So when we were doing this cover, it was the collaboration. She wanted to be that Linda that everybody knew. She wanted to feel good about herself again, and I wasn't going to deny her that act. And also, you know, whatever I would like to say, whatever a woman wants to do with her body, it's up to her. So, you know, I'm very proud of Linda and I'm very proud of that cover. I mean, sometimes you're almost like an activist. Is that how you're like a fashion activist or a political fashion? I'm a makeup artist, so, but I'm definitely a creative. But, you know, I've always believed, you know, look at my life story in my book. You know, I wasn't like I keep saying I wasn't supposed to be here. You know, had my dad not left, I don't know even what would have happened to my family. So even when we ended up in a room, two rooms in a voxel, six of us, we were so happy to be there. Pennyless, but so happy to be there. So, you know, every day, I just, you know, I'm an optimist. And I know it's not the most fashionable thing, but that's why I'm sitting here with you today. Bye. Edward, thank you so much for your time today. Thank you. So what happens is that we create some...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,919,2022-11-19 16:59:20
18306," So what happens is that we create some icons, we call them tags, and they have a signal within them. And when you stare at that, your eye responds to it in a particular way. The way in which that eye response occurs is a signal that we pick up on the visual cortex of the brain at the back of the brain. So the sensor is looking for the signals we create here that come through the eyeball, through the brain, and then onto the visual cortex. Once we've got it there as a signal, we can grab that, we understand what that signal looks like, and we can turn that into a command, whatever we're trying to control. There's multiple places where we think this technology could be applied, perhaps in driving or commanding, and then ground vehicles or a manual vessels, perhaps providing a menu selection and control room environment, maybe in a nuclear power station. And just all those kinds of things are perhaps in the value of this technology. Hydrogen has a very special place in the universe. It's the first element on the periodic table. It is the most abandoned element in the universe. And when clean energy advocates think about what can we find, which would be as easy to use as fossil fuels, they think about hydrogen. The fuel that will, when burn, only produce water. We like to imagine that if we just built enough of these and these, we could ditch fossil fuels and save the planet. Unfortunately, it's not that simple. There are some things where you just need good old-fashioned combustible fuel. Now startups around the world are betting that hydrogen can become the fuel of the 21st century. I guess this week has been described as one of the greatest English soccer strikers of all time. As a player, Gary Linnaker scored 48 goals for England and nearly 250 for English clubs. Since leaving the pitch, he's become the face of football coverage here in the UK and is a big vocal presence on social media. When I sat down with him ahead of the World Cup, I wanted to ask him about concerns that he would catarge human rights record. The lights of David Beckham doing deals with the state and why footballers can never win. Gary, thank you so much for being here. Pleasure. Lovely to have you. It's an interesting time to talk to you because normally before a World Cup, there'd be a lot of the usual feelings, excitement, trepidation. This feels quite different because of the controversy around where it is. Believe you me, this is the same before every World Cup. There are different levels of it and this is high level. But you can go back to 1934 if you want. When World Cup was in Italy, it was used as a vehicle to promote fascism for Mussolini. This is not Brazil in 2014. We were all right on the streets by people in Brazil saying they shouldn't spend all this money on the stadiums. They should spend it on social care. We had Russia who invaded Crimea just a few years before they hosted the World Cup. It's not something we're in accustomed to. Do you think it's on a different scale though because some of the reports about the number of lives that have been lost in the building of the stadium and the preparations? I think what makes this different is not just in terms of human rights and obviously workers' rights and what happened to them and lots of lives were lost in the building of stadium. I think what is really different about this one is that we know when the bid was lost.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,920,2022-11-19 17:03:38
18307," rights and what happened to them and lots of lies were lost in the building of stadium. I think what is really different about this one is that we know when the bid was proved to be successful that it was corrupt. So I think that's what perhaps separates this from the rest. Human rights wise, well there's a few countries that have hosted it that would fail some tests on that. Yeah, well let's go to that in a minute but on the paper point because the former FIFA president, CEP Blatter, has now said it was a mistake. He waited a long time to do that. Yeah, I mean not in the clear mistake. I could have told him that the minute he opened the thing that said guitar on it. I mean do you think there's any value in in that statement at this point or is it just pointless to hear it? I just don't understand why would do that now. I don't know that helps or hinders or what I mean he's you know he's the ex president of FIFA at a time where there was a lot of dodgy goings on. So I thought yes it was a mistake but it was more than a mistake wasn't it really? Well I mean also FIFA just having put out this email let's not focus on the politics, let's focus on the football. Do you think FIFA has learned as a body about what's the important focus? I do believe that the current I should you know maybe I'm being naive I do believe the current people in charge of FIFA and it includes awesome venguars in a really high role. I have certain amount of faith and trust that awesome thing is a decent upstanding non-corrupt person. So I don't think there are levels of corruption if there are any but there will be in certain branches of FIFA because it goes it's global and but in terms of the very top I think it's it's much more transparent the voting system is much more transparent and there's less corruption. Do they still make mistakes? Yes they do in terms of things that they said and that the thing you just mentioned was was very tone deaf to say that because there's no question that this is kind of sports washing but the reason sports washing works is when you are told to shut up about everything else and just say we'll just stick to the football. So I think I think that was that was an error and I think it was a tone deaf statement and I think it's something that most of the federations have I will probably argue against. Some of the players we've heard might be wearing arm bands in support of LGBTQ players and people around the world. Do you think we should hear more from the players themselves? Well I think it's really interesting isn't it because the minute players stand up and voice their concerns everyone sells them stay out of politics stick to football. When they don't stand up and say something people say why aren't you saying anything so there's an element of the footballers that can't win on this. They're inextricably linked politics and sport all sport. There's no getting away from that fact. Politicians will use football when it suits them. So if England start doing well and say you get to the court finals or semi-final you will all have our politicians standing up and they'll be putting England jerseys on and pretending to be really interesting. Now some of them are interested in football a lot of them aren't but even the ones that aren't will suddenly be wanting to be seen and jump on this this England bank wagon of success. But the minute footballers voice themselves and or come out and talk about social issues take Marcus Rashford for example take the captains during Covid all of a sudden it's like well hang on a minute you get a bit above your station here. So footballers are allowed to speak when it suits the politicians I always feel it's always been a little bit of a kind of pet hate of mine. Of course though the people they answer to are their fans as well. So yes the politicians make the statements and get the airtime in response but I suppose it's just also it's been striking how some of the female players have spoken out of female football players about it. I was looking at the comments from England's lotter Wubbin Moyer who said she's not going to watch it. Beth Mead of course hugely successful strikers she's done so well in the game she's just winning all these accolades she's scat herself she said it's just so disappointing and it's quite a big thing to see not going to watch it when you play football for a living. Yeah yeah I mean people make their own decisions on what what they have to do. I just wondered you think they're being bolder because they're not.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,921,2022-11-19 17:07:59
18308," Play football for a living. Yeah, I mean, people make their own decisions on what they have to do. I just wanted to think they're being bolder because they're not involved. Of course, yeah, of course. I mean, it's very easy to say these things if you're not going to play in the world, you're not going to play in it. It's a different thing. Do you think football has got scared about speaking out? I get nervous. I think some will, some won't, some are brave, some of standard. I've been really proud of footballers over the last few years. I think they've really come out on social issues, I've mentioned Rashford before, the captain's joined the thing. We've seen people like Rahim Sterling speak out, brilliantly on racism, things like that. So I've been really proud of the fact, and a lot of them do, and a lot of them will. Well, there's a less comfortable. And it's, for me, it's purely personal issue. I don't, you know, if somebody wants to take a stand in a certain way, that's fine. And if somebody just wants to concentrate on their game, and they're probably, possibly, their only opportunity to play in a world cup, and they just want to get on with the football side of it, and not let these things creep in, that's fine too. You've talked a bit about, because just to say, very clearly, it's, it's, home sexuality is illegal, they cut our. There are also other issues that are very different culturally for the fans, perhaps we'll come on to, but you've also talked about it would be a moment, not to put pressure, but it would be a bit of a moment if a footballer came out as gay. Well, he's doing this to me. I did say that, but I didn't say a footballer should. No, that was just, yeah, the context is important. So I was saying it would be a, you know, big, you know, kind of middle finger to perhaps that thing. And it won't happen. I wouldn't put pressure on any player ever to do that anyway. But of course, it's, of course, it's an issue. The human right side of things, it has to be. A Qatar world cup ambassador has just called homosexuality damage in the mind, which is an insight into the view, the reason for the view. And if you were gay as a fan, would you go to this tournament? It's a great question. I don't know because it's a hypothetical question. I would, you would have to give it a lot of thought, I think. You know, I saw one of their main representatives, I think it was Al-Tani, speaking in an interview saying that, you know, people, gay people will be welcome if the question was asked, what about if they walked down the street holding hands? He said, that will be absolutely fine. But let's see. But there's a risk. But there's a risk. But I understand why people, if, you know, the LGBTQ, etc, would have reservations and thoughts and concerns. Absolutely. Whether I, you could say, whether I would go if I were gay, I honestly don't know. I don't know. I mean, you are going to work to... I'm going to work, yeah. Yeah. How are you feeling about that with this? Well, I'm fine, but I don't have the slightest problem about going to work. I'm not going there to support the World Cup being in Qatar. I'm going there to report. Yeah, to come. For me, that's my job as a kind of sports broadcaster journalist. Yeah. As, you know, journalists will be sent to the war with Russia and Ukraine, but it doesn't mean they support what's going on. No, no, no, no, I don't mean that. But I've meant more like if there was any nervousness, you know, just things like Qatar as UK ambassador has warned against public displays of affection. I'm not saying you're going to be doing any affection. Which you're trying to find. Can't speak a fine thing. I'm not saying that. Happy single man, I understand. But also for the fans, I wonder if you've got a nervousness about that, not just on the human rights side, but the zero tolerance for drinking in public and being drunk. I know. Well, I always have concerns about English fans traveling abroad, because I'm afraid of small, you know, small percentage jobs. I'm do go there looking for trouble, looking to just get drunk, looking for a fight. And that's been part of something that has, I'd just been detestable around the English School for years, and they ruin it for everyone else. What will happen to them in Qatar? I don't know if they go along that thing. But I think we've all got... Well, I think all football fans, obviously, in their ranks, have the drinking side, in things. Yeah, of course. Well, yeah. It's the nervousness, perhaps, around the whole thing as well. I'm sure. I'm sure. I mean, I think we'll all be thinking ourselves, how do we get a drink at some point? There might be that as well. Many footballers, as you self-become pundits, ambassadors, journalists, commentators, there has also been criticism of, for instance, David Beckett, becoming a paid ambassador for Qatar ahead of the World Cup.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,922,2022-11-19 17:12:42
18309," Ambassadors, journalists, commentators. There has also been criticism of, for instance, David Beckett, becoming a paid ambassador to Qatar ahead of the World Cup. He's got to promote tourism and culture and Qatar has become a face of it. What do you make of that sort of decision? Well, that's, again, it's a personal decision. I'm not going to sit here and be judgmental. Would I do it? No. Eric Kansenai, obviously, played with him, has spoken out and urged him to think differently. Yeah. And I understand why he's done that. And as I said, would I have done it? No. He's decided to go down that route. I would say about David. He's never really voiced his concerns about where the World Cup is, about... So, you know, it's not something he's ever got involved in. So, can you coos in a bit? He's not hypocritical. If I'd have done it, I'd have... I was very, very anti-the bid when it was first revealed in 2010. I was in the room. I couldn't believe it. It seemed to me that it must have been corrupt because they were talking about staging a summer World Cup in Qatar where temperatures are in the 40s. Sometimes even approaching 50 degrees centigrade. It seemed unfathomable. So, it did... Then, obviously, laterally, it was moved to winter. And I was very vocal against it. So, if I was going to do something like that, I'd feel hypocritical. I don't think you could accuse Beckham of that. You might accuse him of doing something that... You might feel he's fundamentally a wrong thing to do. And a lot of people will think that. Are you disappointed by him doing that, though? Because he's a role model. For a lot of people? He is a role model. As I said, I wouldn't do it. I think also people think, why does he need 10 million quid? Does he really need to do that? That's the other question. I don't mean... I've no idea how much he's getting paid, but I suspect he would survive without it. While Tesla's in the like make for good headlines, the reality is that even if every car on the roads today won electric, it wouldn't be enough to curb global emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions from transportation account for about 29% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. So, what about the other 71%? Buildings across America burn fossil fuels to operate. What we want to do is make that all electric. Instead of burning oil and gas to give us the energy and electricity we need, we want to do 100% clean energy, all electric. We want to turn buildings into Tesla's. Just like a Tesla or an electric vehicle is all electric with no fossil fuels, we want to do that with our buildings. And if we can do it in one building, we can do it in all buildings. We'll reduce 30% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. To feed your ambition. So before you invent pioneer disrupt, before you change the world, Bloomberg. When you're at stretching centre, you can spot some heavy winds and turn customers onto flight switch. So really a reminder isn't it just how sensitive the market's art?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,923,2022-11-19 17:16:36
18310," This is really a reminder isn't it just how sensitive the markets are to any commentary about trade. We did see some pressure on the U.N. and we did see some pressure on the futures. That is now being reversed. I suppose it is that the feeling of influence and how people have influence on what they use. Of course football is a, you know, it becomes, obviously sports a massive thing in the whole world anyway football particular and just before a World Cup it is and there is a lot of expectancy on footballers but you know there is a lot of criticism about how much they earn and stuff like that and footballers do get it in the neck. It is tough to win. Obviously they have a wonderfully lucrative life but it is funny. I always think they don't really get the criticism in other people with, in other sports even you know you earn lots of money like gold for Formula 1 or you can even go in other routes like actors, huge actors get earned fortunes, musicians, brilliant musicians, they are, if you are in the entertainment industry you do get paid a lot of money but no one else gets that football. It is almost as though it is, all these are working class lads. It is a little bit different. Is that what you think is going on? I genuinely believe it might be subconsciously but I think there is an element of that there a bit above the station. Is it also because they can and do especially because they are so young earning so much money, getting into a lot of trouble at times? Not many of them do. Not many of them do. So yeah, what do you think? And the other thing is, it is absolutely perception thing. Footballers are a cross section of working class society really. They come up and it is hard. They have to work really hard. They live very well. Every now and again a football will misbehave. One out of a, you know, the thousands of them around them. But that becomes a huge story. All the incredible good that they do for the local communities, visiting kids in hospital doing loads of good things, raising awareness of whether it be racism or during the Covid pandemic. That does not become the big story. But one player goes out and a drunk and not out and gets pictured with a girl or something. Then that becomes like a front page story. And it is a little bit unfair and that does not really happen as much in other areas. It is a disproportionate reaction around that. I mean, of course, when acts as, you know, behave badly or things, it also gets captured. But it is interesting to hear you think it is disproportionate. I mean, we should also say that have been some really high profile cases and allegations made against footballers in relation to behaviour with women. On the surface, it seems a change in the culture when you were playing around the game. I do not know if that is fair and what you think about that. I do not know. But I still think, when I played, I doubt it is that much different now. You would have... It is a lot more money, I suppose. Well, there is a lot... Not people not settling down, there is a lot more money. There would be a lot more dangers and outside interests. I honestly think that mostly though, like the massive majority of footballers would be really good lads, well behaved, work really, really hard on what they do and live properly because you have to do now because it is so competitive. I think it was exactly the same. In my day, you will still get the odd drunk, the odd sexist, the odd homophobic person, like a cross section of the working class society and the odd person that will commit a crime. But it is not right. It is very occasional limited. I am not trying to defend the actions of the... I could hear that. I am trying to get context and perspective of the overall picture of football. I suppose though, the other thing that is undeniable is we still don't have an openly gay male footballer in the Premier League. What could change or how could that change do you think to make that a space where it feels comfortable? I don't know. I mean, it is... I mean, it is distressing. And we have seen it, starting to see it in other sports, aren't we? But Tom Daly we have seen. And the women's game as well.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,924,2022-11-19 17:20:57
18311," I've seen it starting to see it in other sports, aren't we? Tom Daly was seen and... Well, in the women's game as well. In the women's game as well. And I just would love it if we had an environment where they just felt... It seems absurd that anyone should... Because often, you're scared of dissaid. Disciase. But it's just... It's a scientific thing as well. I mean, I kind of... Probably naively said something in an interview recently. They got picked up by... Quite a lot of... Smart gay people, which I've kind of learnt from. I was saying, I honestly think that if a footballer came out, it would be hugely positive and others as follow. And they... And they... I was kind of told, you know, don't... Just... You've no idea how difficult this situation is. So... I mean, it's delicate. And it's true. It's kind of baffling because it's obvious there must be... Lots of Premier League footballers and footballers around the country that are gay and having to live... Not their true... And not be their true selves. And I think that's really sad. Did you like looking back on your career? Do you think you played alongside men who weren't their true selves in that way? Oh, I think so. I think so. I'm pretty sure. I don't know for a fact, but... I think so. And have you... Do you have young footballers who come to you, say that they... I've had a couple. Both anonymous, actually. One was... One was very close to coming out. We were... He was actually the secret gay footballer. And he was... I was talking to Andre at message quite a lot. And I was going to be doing the interview when... But then he got cold feet at last second. And I said, well, I totally respect that. I totally understand. And then I was reached out through my agency with another anonymous football that was thinking about it. So I don't know who they are, but they're out there. Of course they're out there. And I couldn't understand how incredibly difficult it must be for me. Do you think it's the fans mainly? I don't know. I don't know. It's probably everything. You know, they're kind of coming out. Who knows? They might not have told their family. They might be scared about that. They might be scared about telling their teammates in the dressing room. I don't... It must be quite incredibly difficult, tough. On your coming out with your political views, a different type of coming out, and saying more what you think about things, it actually did take you a long time, didn't it? It took social media. I mean, I've always had to... No, no. I'd know where to share them. And I think, you know, when you speak out like that, there are people who don't like the reactions and have ended up then self-sensory. Do you ever have that fear that anxiety after you've sent a post or...? I have a policy with... I've got three rules in Twitter. One is not to tweet when I'm... I had a few drinks, which I stick to. The other is not to tweet if I'm angry, but I don't really get angry. So, you know, when I'm too frustrated. And my other one is that whenever I do any kind of tweet, I'll read it back. And then if I have 1% doubt, I won't send it. It's gone. But that one occasionally, when I think of something, I think, actually, that's quite funny. I'll take a chance. But generally, over my three rules... Would you pay for your authenticated... I wouldn't have paid $44 billion for Twitter. Well, there's slightly separate deals. Would you pay? Well, I never asked for it in the first place. No, no, but the whole idea of how they're going to change a model, pay... I don't know yet. I'm going to weigh it out. I'm not going to make any rash decision now. I mean, you know, this is not... But the truth is, actually, most... I mean, a lot of people are on Twitter to follow people that they find interesting, whether they're blue, mostly blue ticked people, whether they're like a politician or actor, or a sports person, or a musician, or real comedians, and you follow them. And they're the blue tick ones. So, actually, I think it's the blue tick people that entice more people onto the platform. So Elon Musk, I think, should be paying us $8 a month, everyone on there, rather than the other way around. Well, you can tweet him direct, because he replies, it seems, to absolutely anyone. Does he? Especially if you've got a blue tick. I doubt it. Agree with me now. I dare you to tweet him. And you mentioned, of course, the reaction to footballers, former footballers, like yourself, from politicians at times. You brought up the panel.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,925,2022-11-19 17:25:25
18312," I dare you to tweet it. You mentioned, of course, the reaction to football as former footballers like yourself from politicians at times. You brought up the pandemic as well. Here in the UK, the former health secretary, Matt Hancock, when asked about football as wages during the lockdown during the pandemic, said, quote, everybody needs to play that part in this national effort. And that means, primarily, footballers too. He talked about taking pay cuts. You'll remember, all of this. He's now in Australia taking part in a reality TV show called, I'm a celebrity, get me asked for, been suspended as a conservative MP. Do you think he's playing his part as an MP? I think you should have stuck to telling footballers to stick to football. Yes. I mean, I did do what he wants, but he's still an acting politician, so it seems a bit strange to me to disappear into the jungle. But I think maybe I did see that thing when I'm really soon at his welcome and he shook everyone's hand and he kind of ignored Hancock in the middle. Yes. And maybe that made him go. That was it. I'm kind of bloody junk. It might also be the 400 grand that he's been using. That might be one of the 400,000 reasons for him going out. I don't know if he's getting that, but they do pay while apparently. Apparently so. But I suppose it was what you were talking about earlier about, who stays in which lane and who polices who. Well, of course. And with politicians, I always find it depends, they'll do it when it suits them. Yes. Well, and then of course, there are those who feel very passionately that our politicians shouldn't be celebrities and shouldn't be reaching for that because they're public servants. And then there's very serious points about them going in a space when those who were bereaved during the pandemic and feel. Indeed. I can understand people's reservations about it. It's almost a kind of bit of comedy in a way, isn't it? But there are obviously more serious issues that he was, you know, he was a large part of the early days with, you know, so many deaths in COVID and some, you know, they would throw the blame at the government in terms of the lack of protection certainly in care homes and things like that. So I don't know. Oh, no. I don't know whether I'll even watch it. So you're not tempted to do any of those particular shows? You're, you're set. Of course, Lord, no. If you ever see me, one of those, you'll know things have gone on. We know it's really bad. That's your equivalent of taking some of these other deals perhaps, so. Yeah, I think so, I don't know. I'd be my worst night. Thank you. Thank you so much for talking to me. And thank you so much for being with us. Until we meet again, take care and goodbye. This is Bloomberg Daybreak, but thanks for coming. Welcome to Bloomberg Crypto. What do Formula One cars and your local supermarket have in common? Well, strange as it sounds, they might both be using the same technology. A lot of innovation has trickle down from the world of high tech engines and it hasn't just found a new life in road cars. F1 cars have long been thought of as the peak of cool. And technology in them is also helping to pull down our produce aisles. Engineers from Williams are using their knowledge from nine constructors' championships working with company Aerofoil to help reduce the energy consumption of supermarkets. The device they're building is based on the design of an F1 cars rear wing. It attaches to fridges to keep more cool air in the unit. They estimate it can reduce supermarket energy consumption by 25%. One innovation from F1 is also helping hybrid's reduce their carbon footprint. That's curves or the kinetic energy recovery system. In common parlance, it's known as regenerative braking and works by storing energy of the car decelerating in a battery for later use. If that's not enough, F1 is now looking at curves or a thermal energy recovery system looking to harness the heat produced from braking and the engine exhaust. That could allow cars to generate the same power using 30% less fuel. So while F1 may have a reputation as a gas guzzler, some of its innovations in the name of speed are helping in the everyday fight against climate change.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,926,2022-11-19 17:29:42
18313," This innovations in the NamUspeed are helping in the everyday fight against climate change. So what's the best investment advice you've ever put in? The compound interest, the compounding of returns is an incredible miracle of business, finance and human existence. Everything you learn is additive every day and if you keep added and don't quit, it's an incredible miracle. And it's not just interest. It was always said above compound interest returns, compound business returns, compound human returns. They're all very additive because you learn every day and if you keep at it, it's very, very helpful. In your observation of investors, what do you think is the biggest mistake that average investors make? Selling at the wrong time. And they sell when the prices go down? Yes. Or yes. They're not keeping, people have conviction or if they invest for the right reasons, they just keep at it. Before the COVID pandemic upended the way the world does business, logistics was one of those industries that might have been taken for granted. That's not the case anymore. Due to all the turbulences over the last two years, customers are now realizing how important it is to have a reliable logistics partner on their side. Our people are doing a quite complex job. People think, are they just a little past somewhere, that's an easy job. If you think about what our people are doing, it's quite complex. Businesses and consumers are suddenly thinking a lot more about how things they need reach places where they're needed. It's thrust the sector into the spotlight. Logistics and supply chain has become a household need. It's dramatically different than three pandemic. Yes, it's grown, whether that's in market power, revenue, profitability, investor interest. For Deutsche Post DHL Group, that's created opportunity to build on momentum and set ambitious goals for service and performance. When you look at our footprint, you're the most international logistics company there is. We want to become more digital and we want to be much more sustainable than we have been. DP DHL's revenue has soared since 2020, with full-year profit nearly doubling in 2021. CFO Melanie Christ is a key leader of the team that's delivered these results. She views her role as much more than just a number cruncher. There are unfortunately these clichés that finance is boring and it's kind of like been counting in the back office to be successful in finance. You have to have the financial expertise, right? But we also have to be credible business leaders in order to really impact the business and steer the direction. She is extremely smart and bright. You need somebody who is able to digest a lot of information that rapidly and can distinguish what is important and what is less important. And she has tremendous skill in that. And she's not afraid to call people out, to call out other members of the executive team if she feels that something isn't being. She does that in a very nice way, actually. She helps meet tremendously in steering of the company because she is highly regarded by my other colleagues in the senior team. And typically if they have a problem, they share it first with her before they come to me. When I think about the conversations I have with Frank, the shortest part is actually about the analysis and the facts.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,927,2022-11-19 17:33:55
18314," I shared first with her before they come to me. When I think about the conversations I have with Frank, the shortest part is actually about the analysis and the facts. It's more the debate about, okay, on that basis, what are the options? What can we do? My role is essentially saying in three sentences, what is working well in this company? Where do we have challenges and what should we do going forward? Deutsche Post DHL Group consists of five divisions, express, Germany's Post and Parcel Service, global forwarding and freight, supply chain and e-commerce solutions. Each of these segments has seen revenue growth in the last four years, while the surge of e-commerce volume during the pandemic has had a direct impact on the trajectory. Have you seen e-commerce as a very structural and fundamental growth for us as a company? What we now saw under the pandemic was a structural acceleration. It took us forward to a point in terms of e-compensation which we probably would have reached on the normal circumstances in three years' time. So it was a big step forward. DP DHL was well prepared to take this step. The company's strategic plan recognized e-commerce as a growing trend in the logistics landscape, but no one could have forecast the speed and breadth of the transformation. We are now seeing that also another pandemic, not only domestic e-commerce has taken a faster growth trajectories and anticipated, but also cross-border e-commerce. We see that very clearly in our express network, but also in our e-commerce solutions division. What are the other big structural shifts that you see on the horizon? Is it e-commerce B2B? Is it increased trade as globalisation restructures? What are the shifts that you're seeing? The board B2B e-commerce is still at a very early stage, so we believe that there will be a huge post-opportunity there. We also see that when we are talking to our customers now, I guess everybody has been aware that being dependent on just one supplier in one province in one country is probably not a good idea. So they want to build more resilience into the supply chain. I think our international footprint, our global strengths, is really something we can leverage for the benefit of our customers. Another factor in the company's favour is its balance sheet. Since Melanie Christ became CFO, cash flow has improved significantly. One of my priorities over the last years has been to really focus the whole organisation on better cash generation. It's not just a finance job, making sure that ultimately revenue converts into EBIT and into cash in the bank account, it's the responsibility of the whole organisation. She says, we can't be successful as a company, if we are not collecting the cash for our services we have provided. She has not missed one single opportunity to talk about that. I think it's a very comfortable situation, particularly in the current environment, to have a strong balance sheet. I think in that respect, I'm very conservative, and I'd rather have a bit more on the balance sheet and a bit more buffer. Spell out for us what the priorities are, the longer-term priorities, in terms of putting some of that cash to use for you. The first priority here is organic growth. We clearly indicated also that this is our CAPEX budget, for the next three years, that we will keep investing into organic growth. We are very focused on our regular dividend payment. And then, if there is something left, which is fortunately the case at the moment, we will think about inorganic opportunities, and we will also think about other means to allow our shareholders to participate. That is why we are currently running a 2 billion euro share-bite program. Inorganic opportunities include M&A, like the recent purchase of beverage shipper, Hillerbrand. But deploying cash is always subject to careful consideration. Does Melanie ever turn around and say, no, when you're pushing through, or pushing for a particular package of spending? Yes, she does that quite often, you know, because she has... She is a person, and that's great, if you have a CEO who is risk-abuse, because you need somebody. And the business is always too optimistic.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,928,2022-11-19 17:38:23
18315," because you need somebody. You know, the business is always too optimistic. Melanie might be something too pessimistic, but that's a very healthy discussion. And if we then jointly come to the same conclusion after a debate, then we are probably in the right spot. How often do you find yourself saying no to divisional heads? So when I was promoted into the CFO position, my team gave me a stamp with rejected. It sits on my desk. I think the fact that people know it sits there already has instilled quite a lot of discipline in the organization. So I think when I get a proposal, it has already gone through a number of iterations and is normally of such a high quality that I don't need the rejected stamp too often. For the time being, Christ should be able to keep that stamp in a drawer. CEO Frank Appell has expressed a commitment to service quality and confidence that customers will accept higher prices that come with it. If you are too expensive, you will be out of business, but if you don't provide the right quality, you will be out of business as well. So we want to be. We will never be the cheapest in town. That's not doable. We are the premium provider. That's our strategy. Of course, it's also more challenging for us when our customers are under pressure. At the same time, I think, over all the last two years have shown that a reliable high quality supply chain comes at a certain price tag. I definitely see that inflation is having a huge impact on the logistics industry. And there's been substantial price increases in the last few years. I do not see that changing. There's a lot of innovation happening. And I don't see the inflation necessarily going away. It might level out a bit, but it's not going to go away. The logistics companies may have pricing power with customers, but their stock prices haven't been so robust. I think that the issue there is the increase in interest rates has made everyone rethink and be concerned about the level of inventory that is out in the system, if you will, and with the level of disruption. I think what's happened more in the last three months is there's more of a view that we're having into certainly any coming slowdown, maybe a recession. With more than half its revenue coming from Europe, investors may see DPDHL as more exposed to recession risks than its global peers. The company insists it can meet its revenue targets in the event of a downturn. It's counting on diversification as a cushion. I'm not so pessimistic that there is really a deep recession at our doorstep. But even then, our portfolio is very much balanced. We are everywhere in the world, and the world will not go entirely in recession. I doubt that. Would it be a stretch to suggest that DPDHL is to some extent recession proof? I wouldn't go as far as to say recession proof, but I think we are very well positioned to deal with all different types of recession scenarios due to the breadth of support for you. The balance of support for you really gives us a lot of resilience against any type of headwind. Coming up, a look at DPDHL's investments in action. Melanie Christ shows me around the company's state-of-the-art logistics hub. What I love about this building is it actually shows the big mega trends which formed our strategy 2025.

18316," As the chief financial officer of one of the world's largest logistics companies, Melanie Christ has made her mark in global business. That's not what she originally attended to do. I really wanted to go into research. I wanted to become a physicist and that was where my passion was. But then during my studies, some friends of mine started doing this strange thing. They went into management consulting. I didn't even know how to spell it and I had no idea what it was about. But what they told me was quite interesting. And so I ended up doing an internship with a consulting firm and I learned more in the two months there than I had in the last two years in my physics job at university. That is how I ended up in consulting. She started her career with three years at McKinsey, then spent four years in private equity with APAC's partners in London before joining Deutsche Post DHL Group in 2004. I was brought into the company to do international M&A project. That was at the time around 20 years ago when we were really building the company in the current shape, acquiring lots of logistics companies around the world. The M&A part was the first thing and I then wandered into a more mainstream finance field here in the group becoming the CFO of our DHL Express division. So from then on it was more leading towards the CFO role eventually. Melanie Christ now heads the finance team with around 11,000 employees. Success in this role is as much an art as a science. If you do the greatest piece of analysis and you see it all and you know it all, but you can't convey that message and you can't convince the rest of the organisation that we should move into a certain direction, it's useless. DHL is sending a consistent message with its investments. The company spent 123 million euros to upgrade its logistic centre at the Cologne-Born Airport, designing it around key strategic goals. What I love about this building is it actually shows the big mega trends which formed our strategy 2025 which was inaugurated in 2019 when this building opened. So globalisation connecting the birds. Ecommerce, we have a lot of sortation facilities here for smaller ecommerce shipments. Sustainability, it's a very sustainable building, there's solar panels on the roof and everything and digitalisation and well you can obviously see that it is quite automated. How did the team pitch this investment to you initially and how hard was it as a cell for them? How quickly did you turn around say yes, this is worth 123 million euros. Of course you always have to make sure that you have the right capacity for the growth in the network and at that time they came and said hey we will really see a strong growth in ecommerce volumes on top of the regular B2B growth, we need more sorting capacity, we need this building and of course there are always debates, does it really have to cost 123 million euros and so on. Unfortunately they convinced us because then with Covid and the volume search we urgently needed the capacity. At the same time as Covid accelerated demand for logistic services, disruptions in the labour supply hurt productivity. Advances and technology like this digital sauter have helped offset some pressures but automation also raises questions. Does this tell us that this is the business grows, this is going to become a more automated business that is going to be less need for labour, for workers? Well you still see people here and I think what you can nicely witness here is the combination of technology which supports people. So for example when you look at the customs area, it used to be a very manual and sometimes confusing process. Now the people are supported in picking the right shipments for customs inspections by light and they are automatically sorted in this sauter to go to customs inspections. So it is also the helping the people with the jobs they are doing every day. We are over set in 2019-20. We might get one third less jobs in the current setup until 2030 if we digitalise the organisation but we are very sure that our company will be at least 50, maybe 100% bigger and we will have more jobs to offer than that. At the beginning of a couple of years ago when we started that journey people said oh, I might lose my job, I haven't heard that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,930,2022-11-19 17:47:00
18317," We're present bigger and we will have more jobs to offer than that. At the beginning of a couple of years ago when we started that journey, people said, oh, you know, I might lose my job. I haven't heard that in the last two years as a question in the town hall. This airport hub also showcases DP DHL's aviation fleet, which both small than 320 dedicated cargo aircraft. The own, the biggest tank of our aircraft, but we also have short and medium and long-term leases. And with the growth in our business, we anticipate that the fleet will keep going. You've talked about investing, of course, in sustainable fuel. Yes. When does that come online? How significant is it? Is it just the critics might say that's just window dressing around a part of the business that is, of course, very carbon intensive, at least a lot of emissions? Yeah, so you absolutely write the problem with our beautiful aircraft is the CO2 emissions. And when you look at our overall CO2 emissions, two-thirds are from aviation. It is about flying these birds with more sustainable fuel. And we said that we're really willing to spend billions on it. We now really hope that we will see the uptick and supply over the next years. Spending billions isn't vague hyperbole. The company has pledged to put seven billion euros towards sustainable technologies and fuels by 2030, with a goal of climate neutral logistics by 2050. Sustainability makes good business sense anyway, especially if you are in a business that is energy or fuel hungry as a compliance element that not just operators in the logistics sector need to consider, but also their customers. So being transparent becomes part of the service about their impact on the globe. We had a lengthy discussion. It should be made a financial commitment. How much we want to invest for the next decade in our sustainability. And we had a long debate, is it right, to say we want to invest seven billion on 2030? There were pros and cons. But that was a very intense discussion melody in I-Hat, where we finally came to the conclusion that this is a right number. This is a right approach. We convinced our colleague, and that's the reason why we are, where we are, where we are seen as somebody who really commit. We have not met many companies who have quantified their future investment. Still ahead, how one of the business world's most influential women is working to strengthen gender equality within her company. I think the great thing is that now across the board, in finance, but also in the group overall, we have role models which show young female talent that everything is possible. This is Bloomberg. Okay, so you're moving in on me quick. Just stradzing me with your fancy hands. I'm going to deal with your knight, because it's really bothering me. Ah, my knight. Yeah, he's a troublemaker. Yeah.

18318," Resources from more than 120 countries, the moment news breaks 24 hours a day. Remember, you are global business authority. Deutsche Post DHL Group's CFO Melanie Christ is often named to lists of the most powerful women in business. And while men still outnumber women as finance heads of large companies, there are signs that the balance is shifting. The number of female CFOs across major US companies has risen to an all time high, according to a study by Chris Coulder Associates. And executive search firm Cohen Partners reports that 36% of new CFOs hired by notable companies in the first half of 2022 were women. I ask Melanie Christ if she's encountered obstacles as a woman rising through the executive ranks. I have to say, I have not made many negative experiences. Maybe I was also a little bit naive in not thinking about these challenges so much. So when I studied physics, there weren't many women, so I was somehow always used to it. And it can also be an advantage when you're kind of like the only girl in the room. I mean, the boss at the end remembers your name and not the 19 guys who all kind of like wear dark suits and white shirts and look alike, right? So I never experienced it as an external stress factor. I have to say for me personally, it was more balancing my own expectations around kind of like getting family and the job combined. But that was probably more of a pressure I put on myself, thinking that I had to be perfect in every dimension and not something where the pressure was put on me from my male colleagues. So how do you take that experience and put it to play in terms of how you advance the role of women in this organization? I think the great thing is that now across the board, in finance, but also in the group overall, we have role models which show young female talent that everything is possible. In finance, we have a share of women in management of 32%, so we are ahead of the group. We want to get to 35% by 2025. I think we are now at a position where if we have a vacancy, I want to have at least one woman on the short list because we have enough female talent. So every short list should contain a woman and then the best person in the race should win. CEO Frank Appell says Christ sets an example for the entire organization. He believes her success may influence the entire industry. She has proven that she is an outstanding CEO for all. And she's definitely a role model in many dimensions that you know what I like about there. She is still you know a very warm and nice person and that makes such a big difference. So you can get to that level without compromising on how nice you are as a person. I think she's a great role model and I hope that this has had positive impact for many others. From the big picture down to the smallest operational details, Melanie Christ is fully engaged in guiding DP DHL into the future. I wanted to know what she sees when she looks ahead. What juice is the biggest opportunities for DP DHL over the next 10 years? I think we have a fantastic portfolio and we just have to leverage the growth opportunities which are there both on the ECOM site and also on the traditional B2B site. And the key differentiators for us will be digitalisation, sustainability and our great people. As you look ahead 10 years, what are some of the challenges? What keeps you up at night as you think about the business going forward? I think we have to keep this focus.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,932,2022-11-19 17:55:37
18319," and our great people. As you look ahead 10 years, what are some of the challenges, what keeps you up at night as you think about the business going forward? I think we have to keep this focus and the ability to adjust in a very agile way. Sometimes when you kind of like think about all the risk controlling and stuff, people tend to create the impression that you can preplan everything. That's clearly not the case. So I think we have to stay focused and keep the ability to react in a very agile way. But looking at what happened over the last 24 months, I'm very optimistic that we will also be able to cope with whatever happens next. And how do you see your role changing in the years ahead? I think it is changing at a very rapid pace, which is a great thing because it never gets boring. Those elements I just mentioned for the group overall digitalisation and sustainability are also hugely relevant for the finance role. It's like a new language you have to learn. And you learn vocabulary, but then you also have to develop a feeling if I kind of like put so much capital into this decarbonisation measure, I get so much in terms of return out of it. But that's a fascinating opportunity where we can make a huge difference for finance and for the group overall. As you look to the future, Melanie, what do you think is going to be the skill sets, the knowledge bases, they're going to be essential to the success of future CFOs? Yes, probably the two most essential new skills will be to get even better at lifelong learning, because we will have to learn so much new stuff every year. Be it in the digitalisation area, be it on sustainability. So this ability also has a 50-year plus-old person to keep learning and keep the curiosity. I think that is going to be super essential. And the second element will be being a great team player. The word is complex, you can't know it all, so you really have to work even more strongly with your team. What advice would you give to someone who's just recently been appointed CFO? That's a great question. I think I would probably simply say, be curious and ask as many questions as you can, try to learn as much as possible, not only in the finance area, but get close to the business, try to really understand the business, because only when you are close to the business and you understand the fundamental profit drivers, will you be a really great CFO. I'm Tom McKenzie. This is Bloomberg. At some point, you had to fight for the trademark, right, for the red soul. Is that stressful? Very stressful. Very stressful. Especially, we are a small company in a way, and we have to fight people who have those huge companies, who put you 27 lawyers on your back for something which is very stressful. I wish it didn't happen. Everything which happened to me is a lesson in a way, bad or good, and once it's done, it's done, and you're sort of happy. I'm happy about it. That thing, I could have definitely been avoided, but it's done. Did you realize at the time when you started the company that you would become so successful and actually so big? No, no. When I started the company, I wanted to have a shop in Paris, which is my hometown, and I wanted to do pretty shoes for pretty girls. That was my goal. And now you look back and you say, actually, I still make pretty shoes, but for many more women. Yeah, absolutely. Do you think you would have been so successful without the red soul? I think the red soul definitely, of course, participates to my work, but also to the fame of my shoes because it's instantly recognizable. But then, you know, the design is very important. But definitely, when you have such a strong sign of recognition, it participates to, yeah. Imagine simply climbing a cable into space. The concept is known as the space elevator. Not only could it significantly change how we leave planet Earth, but it could also completely transform humanity's relationship with space. And there are scientists who think we could have already built it. We have the material.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,933,2022-11-19 18:00:04
18320," Completely transform humanity's relationship with space. And they're a scientist who think we could have already built it. We have the material, we have the technology, we have the lasers, we have the climbers, we have all of it. If a private entity wants to build it or a government, they can build it. It'll change society. We have no clue how colonizing in the space, how really spreading on the space really changed our society over the next 50 to 200 years. It'll be completely different. You've got to explain this one to me. What does it mean when the White House says we're watching markets carefully? It means they have a Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. They have been in insane it. Lots of Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. What does it mean? It means they have a Bloomberg. I think that it's hard to put your head around any narrative. Let's just be honest. We've had sort of a shift in, are we in some sort of circulation fears? Moments people were talking about that all day yesterday. This is my kitchen table and also my filing system. Over much of the past three decades, I've been an investor. The highest quality of mankind I've often thought was private equity. And then I started interviewing. I watched your interview. I know how to do some interviews. I've learned in doing my interviews how leaders make it to the top. I asked him how much he wanted. He said 250. I said fine. I didn't negotiate with him. I did no due diligence. I have something I'd like to sell. And how they stay there. You don't feel inadequate now because being on the second wealthiest man that grows that right. One of the president's closest advisors is Jake Sullivan. He was the national security advisor. He was the youngest person to hold that job at the age of 43. I sat down with him recently here in the executive office building to discuss a wide range of international issues and national security issues affecting the president and our country. So let me get right to the heart of Ukraine if I get to ask you. Is there any chance of a resolution in Ukraine matter any time in the foreseeable future, any possibility of a truce or some kind of agreement that you think could end this war in the next few months or so? You never say never. There's always a chance. And we've been clear from the beginning that we would support a diplomatic solution that vindicated Ukraine's right to sovereignty and territorial integrity. But the odds have been in the next few months I think are quite low. On China, the president of the United States has not met with Xi Jinping for COVID-related reasons. But there isn't possibility they might meet in the upcoming G20 meeting. Do you have any plans to have a agreement or any kind of proposed settlement? Are there any issues that are now ongoing between the two countries? Or is it just more or less a meet and greet with no advanced planning of any great consequence? Well, right now there's no meeting planned. But as you say, they will both be in Bali, Indonesia for the G20 in November. And it would afford an opportunity for the two of them to sit down in person. Actually, despite the fact that they've spent a huge amount of time together when Joe Biden was vice president, they've not met in person since President Biden became president. And that's because Xi Jinping is basically not left China in two years due to COVID-19. So this would be their first real chance to sit face to face and talk through the full range of issues in the relationship. I wouldn't expect major agreements to come out of that. But if they do actually sit, and again, that hasn't been decided, I would expect that we would see some progress on some issues where the two countries' interests do align. As we talk today, it's coming out that President Putin will be meeting with President Xi Jinping, most likely somewhere in Europe. I'm not too long from now. Is that a surprise to you? And what do you think they're going to be talking about? Well, it's not a surprise. It's President Xi.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,934,2022-11-19 18:04:30
18321," being most likely somewhere in Europe. I'm not too long from now. Was that a surprise to you? And what do you think they're going to be talking about? Well, it's not a surprise. President Xi and President Putin have met frequently over the course of each of their tenure. And in fact, President Putin went to Beijing earlier this year and met in person with President Xi in February when they rolled out this new partnership between the two countries. So I think that they'll talk about the full range of issues in their relationship. But I would note two things. First, before President Xi goes to Uzbekistan to meet with President Putin on the sidelines of another summit, he's going to Kazakhstan. And Kazakhstan's a place where actually China and Russia compete for influence. So it's an indication that this is a relationship not without its complications. And then second, China has actually stood back from fully getting in behind the Russians when it comes to their war in Ukraine. We have not seen them provide large-scale support in terms of weapons or industrial scale efforts to undermine Western sanctions. So from our perspective, this relationship is something that bears close watching. But again, is not without its complications. As we talk, there's also reports that North Korea is selling weapons to Russia. Was that a surprise to the administration? Well, what it indicates, actually, is that Russia doesn't have a lot of options. It appears to be running short of its own munitions. It looks around the world and doesn't find a lot of countries willing to sell it munitions. So it has to look to states like Iran and North Korea to get ammunition and other forms of weaponry to be able to sustain its conflict in Ukraine. This is not, in our view, a demonstration of strength by Russia. Now, the negotiation with Iran to restore, if that's the right verb, the nuclear agreement is ongoing, it's been ongoing for quite some time. Do you see any resolution of that in the near future? And not in the coming days. The Iranians have come back with a set of counter proposals, which we are still taking a look at. But it doesn't suggest that an agreement is imminent right away. That being said, we do believe that there still is a pathway to a compliance for compliance return to the JCPOA. We will continue to work on that with our partners, particularly our European partners. And if Iran is prepared to do its part to get back into the JCPOA, we stand ready to do so. And as we talk, the new Prime Minister of UK has been announced previously involved in foreign policy. Have you met her before? I have met her before. I've met her here in the White House, right down the hall from where we are right now, when she was foreign secretary. She's transitioned from being essentially their secretary of state to being their prime minister. And actually, just yesterday, President Biden had the opportunity to have a long phone call with her just hours after she had assumed her new position. And do you expect any change in the UK, US policy, as a result of her becoming prime minister? At a foundational level, no. This is a special relationship. The two of them reaffirmed their commitment to the strength and vitality of the US-UK alliance. And I think on all of the major issues, whether it's Russia, or China, or Iran, you'll see the same kind of deep consultation and engagement between the two countries that you've seen before, regardless of who's president, regardless of who's prime minister. So I don't expect that there will be any fundamental changes in the relationship, but there'll be issues that we have to work through, of course, as there always are. Now, as we talk, the UN General Assembly will be meeting not too long from now in New York, as it does every year. Do you think the UN has still a useful purpose in diplomacy because it doesn't seem to be able to solve any problems, ongoing war problems that we now see in the US, a Ukraine or Russia? What do you think is the UN's main purpose at this point? Well, the UN actually has proved its continued effectiveness in actually being able to bring about diplomatic agreements in very difficult circumstances. I'll give you just two examples from the past few months. First, on Russia, Ukraine. It was the UN Secretary General Antonio Gutarraish, who played a central role in getting a deal between Russia and Ukraine for the export of grain from both Ukrainian ports and Russian ports in the Black Sea. That's helping the entire world with respect to lowering food prices.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,935,2022-11-19 18:08:53
18322," Russia and Ukraine for the export of grain from both Ukrainian ports and Russian ports in the Black Sea. That's helping the entire world with respect to lowering food prices and expanding access to foodstuffs at a critical moment. Second, it was a UN mediator working with our U.S. envoy, the Saudis, Emirates, and the Yemenis, who helped produce earlier this year a ceasefire in the war in Yemen, which had been the worst humanitarian catastrophe in the world. That ceasefire is now going on six months, the longest period of peace in seven years in Yemen, and the UN played a key role in that. So it is not without its difficulties and complications. It is a big bureaucracy in need of constant reform, but the UN is still there on key issues in diplomacy, in delivering on global health, global food security, and other issues, and all of that will be on display in New York in two weeks. Now recently, the President made a major speech on democracy. While the threat to American democracy is real, I want to say as clearly as we can, we are not powerless in the face of these threats. And in it, he talked about the values of democracy, which is large part of our foreign policy, which is to promote democracy around the world. Our events in the United States are the last year or so making it more difficult for the U.S. to say to other countries, looking how wonderful our democracy has worked, and therefore you should be following some of the things we do. Well, it does require a degree of humility. I mean, the United States does need to acknowledge that we have our own difficulties and challenges within our own democracy, even as we tout and promote democratic institutions, rule of law, human rights around the world. But I think President Biden is actually a very good messenger for that. Someone who can speak honestly and clearly to the American people about the strains in our democracy, and then someone who can speak honestly and clearly to the world, about how despite all of its imperfections, democracy remains the best form of government for delivering, for citizens, and for promoting human dignity. What do you think of when you think of a battery? For most, it's what we use to power devices for both work and play, and maybe even your car. Over the past few decades, they've gotten way more powerful, long-lasting, and affordable. But all of this is just a prologue to what the next batteries are going to do. As we drive to an increasingly renewable power driven grid, we also need to be able to store energy and release it later to cover those periods of weather intermittencies that are driving this new grid that we're in. It's a multi-trillion dollar opportunity, and it's imperative that we figure out the solution here. How we store energy on a massive scale is in many ways the central challenge of the fight to stop climate change. Let's talk a moment about your own background. You are not generally out there promoting your background. It's quite impressive, and I just want to let people know about it a bit. You grew up in Minnesota. That's right. And I guess you were a superstar in elementary school, junior high school, your president of your class, president of student government. Is there anything you failed to do in high school that you wanted to do? Well, I didn't win all the cross-country races that I wanted to win, I guess. But you went to Yale, and Yale, you must have done reasonably well. You were elected as a road scholar, and from Oxford, you later came back and went to Yale Law School, and you were a top-editor there and became a Supreme Court clerk for Justice Breyer. So, when you're having this career, do you ever think that you could make a mistake or your career could kind of go off the deep end or something, because everything was working out perfectly? Well, it's true that I have had these incredible opportunities, but at every one of those stages, I went through the same fears.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,936,2022-11-19 18:13:02
18323," Is it a deep end or something? Because everything was working out perfectly. Well, it's true that I have had these incredible opportunities. But at every one of those stages, I went through the same fears and growing pains and slip ups and stumbles that everybody did. And that was true with respect to academic work that was far from perfect. It was true with respect to relationships that didn't work out. I had what I think was an incredibly lucky childhood in upbringing. But one that was not too different from the way a lot of other people who grew up in the Midwest in the 1980s and then got to have these chances. Their father and mother, what did they do? So my father worked on the business side of Minneapolis Star Tribune, which was the major newspaper in Minneapolis. My mother was a teacher and a guidance counselor in the Minneapolis Public Schools. And I'm one of five. I'm the second of five kids. And we all went to the Minneapolis Public Schools graduated from Southwest High School. And your siblings, do they say, look, you're too good. You're a road scholar. You're a yellow wall journal and everything. Or there are no sibling rivalries. I mean, actually, I would say my sister is probably the most impressive among us. She's a pediatrician. She was a two sport division one athlete. And she's got five kids and is currently working at the Department of Health and Human Services on COVID-19 and other pandemic responses. So I'm like kind of middle of the pack in terms of my siblings. So there was another person who was a road scholar went to Yale Law School who became President of the United States Bill Clinton. So have you ever thought of running for office yourself? I used to think about it. But honestly, over the course of the years, I think my skills are better suited to public service and a not elected format. And I'd rather help other people who I think would be better suited for actually running for office themselves. Talk for a moment about what it's like to be the National Security Advisor. The National Security Advisor office was set up, I think, in the Eisenhower administration, more or less. So President Truman had a National Security Advisor as well. Your job is to get in early every day, make sure there's no crisis or there is a crisis to tell the president. Are you seeing the president early in the morning and briefing him? Is that what you do as many have done before? Yes. So in the morning, we have something called the President's Daily Brief. That takes place in the Oval Office. And it's myself, my two deputies, and then the director of National Intelligence, who are there every day. And then we also bring in other cabinet members, depending on what the subjects are being briefed, so that the president gets exposure to his full national security team over the course of the week. And we talked to him about things that have developed overnight around the world. And we also talked to him about longer-term trends that he expresses interest in and wants to stay on top of. So it's a mix of both the immediate term and the long term. And it gives him a full picture of the challenges and opportunities in the world for American folks. And then during a typical day, do you see him a couple other times? Do you see him at the end of the day as well? Well, just to take yesterday as an example, in addition to the PDB, Secretary Blinken and I had the opportunity to just sit with him informally for a little while before the cabinet meeting. So we could talk through a kind of tick list of issues that had been building up over the course the last couple of weeks. And then later in the afternoon, we had this call with the British Prime Minister. And that involved some amount of time to talk through what he wanted to accomplish in that phone call, what we expected. She would say to him. And then I sat there with him while he did the phone call. So that would be a typical day, seeing the president two, three times. And then spending time with the other principles of the National Security Council, the cabinet secretary, secretary of defense, the secretary of the treasury, the secretary of state, and talking through the big decisions that we would need to tee up for the president to make on everything from global food security to Taiwan, to the CHIPS Act, the new law that's been passed to invest in advanced microchips here in the United States. We covered the waterfront. So sometimes presidents, I've lost their temper and they yell. His president Biden, Yeller, when he's not happy, or he just calmly just says, here's what I think. He's not a Yeller. He's somebody who is disciplined and joking.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,937,2022-11-19 18:17:31
18324," He's somebody who is disciplined and direct and holds us to a high standard. And he will challenge us to make sure that we have nailed down the details of everything we are presenting to him. And if we haven't, he'll tell us, do better. But he does so in a totally respectful, straightforward way, the same way that everybody has seen him in public life. So, when I work in the White House under President Carter, there were frequent disputes between the Secretary of State, side vans, and the National Security Adviser is a big brazen ski. And it's a great tradition, it seems, in our government, that the Secretary of State, the National Security Adviser, are always sparring one where they are leaking to the press. In this administration, I haven't seen a lot of leaks from your office or the Secretary's office criticizing the other person's office. So, how have you avoided that problem? Well, a lot of it has to do with just deep mutual respect and straight-up friendship between myself and the Secretary of State. Tony and I have known each other for years. We're good friends, our families are friends. That doesn't mean that there aren't debates. We don't have disputes because we have an open, operating style. I think we both try to be nice people. But we do have debates. We disagree on certain issues. And the thing that I take very seriously is my responsibility to run a process that is open, humane, fair, transparent, and above board. And I try to do that so that his perspective, the Secretary of Defense's perspective, the Attorney General's perspective, depending on the issue, are all teed up to the President in a way in which they get their say. And then we work it out. And that has, in my view, worked quite effectively over the course of the past 19 months. And I consider it one of the central responsibilities of my position to ensure that that process is fair and effective. And hindsight, which is always 2020, is there anything the administration could have done to prevent Putin from invading? Six months into this invasion, I'm fairly well convinced that Putin was going to do this no matter what. Back in 1997, I was interested in the following question, which is there are a bunch of the dinosaurs called Saurapod dinosaurs, which had really long skinny necks. So Apatosaurus is an example. Now, I said really long skinny tails. So I made a computer model that showed that in fact the tail of these Saurapod dinosaurs could actually act like a whip, a bullfip. Now, the way a bullfip makes that cracking noise is because the tip of the whip actually goes about twice the speed of sound. And that crack is a sonic boom. I think the way they got a date was to impress the females by making loud booms. Bloomberg has enhanced search on the terminal to deliver what you need when you need it.

It's difficult, obviously, through multiple presidents going back to the Clinton administration. The North Koreans have continued to move forward.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,938,2022-11-19 18:21:47
18325," As it ends going back to the Clinton administration, the North Koreans have continued to move forward with their nuclear weapons program. In the course of the past year, they have conducted a number of long-range missile tests. We have been warning about the possibility of a seventh nuclear test, test of a nuclear weapon. And we still think that that is something that is likely to happen in the coming months. We have also indicated to the North Koreans that we are prepared to sit down in a serious way to conduct diplomacy, to on a step-by-step basis work towards the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. So far, the North Koreans have been so interested in that. China and Taiwan. There has been a lot of rhetoric from the U.S. side, a lot of rhetoric from the Chinese side. Vision and a real problem occurring where the Chinese might actually invade Taiwan. I think it remains a distinct threat that there could be a military contingency around Taiwan. And the People's Republic of China has actually stated as official policy that it is not taking the invasion of Taiwan off the table, that that remains one of the potential options for the reunification of Taiwan. Their position has been changing over time. In terms of their disturbance of the status quo across the Taiwan Strait, actions that they are taking with their military to undermine peace and stability. The American position has remained steadfast and consistent. One China policy, Taiwan Relations Act, three joint communicates that we agreed with China back in the 1970s and 80s that laid out that from our perspective, there should be no unilateral changes to the status quo across the Taiwan Strait. We continue to believe that and we will continue to push back against any effort to change the status quo by force. Now there is legislation now moving forward through Congress to kind of toughen up the existing support the U.S. has for Taiwan. Is administration adopted a position on that legislation yet? Well, I'm actually going to have the opportunity later today, literally later today to go up to the hill to talk to some members about this legislation. I prefer to have the opportunity to lay it out for them before I lay it out on TV. But I will just say this, there are elements of that legislation with respect to how we can strengthen our security assistance for Taiwan that are quite effective and robust that will improve Taiwan's security. There are other elements that give us some concern. Let's go back to Ukraine for a moment. In hindsight, which is always 2020, is there anything the administration could have done to prevent Putin from invading or told the allies more forcefully that this invasion was going to occur to convince them because it seemed as if they didn't really believe what was going to happen. What would you have done or would you think you should have done in hindsight if anything differently than you did? Given that we're still in the middle of the sun folding crisis, it's hard to get the kind of level of perspective to look back and say, hey, maybe we could have done this instead of that. There's always something you could have improved upon. I would never say no, no, no, we did everything absolutely perfectly. But six months into this invasion, I'm fairly well convinced that Putin was going to do this no matter what, that he considered this central to his legacy as President of Russia, and he was not going to be knocked off course. The only thing that was going to stop him was the physical might of the Ukrainian forces holding back his ability to take Kiev and take other major cities backed by the weapons that we provided them. That was the strategy we executed. I think we executed it well, and I think Ukraine is in a position now today to ensure that they will remain a strong, sovereign, viable independent state, even as they continue to try to resist Russian aggression on a portion of their territory. In terms of the Allies, we took unprecedented measures, quite novel measures, to declassify information, to make presentations both to our allies and to the international community. And I think over time that actually did build a sense of unity that continues to this day. An Allied unity, Transatlantic unity, has been a huge thorn on the side for Vladimir Putin, as he's tried to break that and tried to produce a weaker, less cohesivnado when, in fact, what he's gotten is the exact opposite. So what you're referring to, I think, is that to my surprise when I was reading The New York Times about this was going on, information that seemed like it was vital information was declassified, and in effect, given to the press about the troop movements of the Russians. Was that a complicated decision to come to controversial within the administration to say we're going to declassify?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,939,2022-11-19 18:26:14
18326," And in effect, given to the press about the troop movements of the Russians, was that a complicated decision to come to controversial within the administration to say we're going to declassify and leak our best intelligence about what the Russians are doing? It definitely took a whole process of us thinking about all of the risks and benefits of doing that, especially since it was uncharted territory. And that involved me sitting with our intelligence professionals, our diplomats, and ultimately with the president to bless a strategy that would involve the systematic declassification of information so that no one would be surprised and so that Russia could not try to generate pretext for what it was doing. And I think it turned out to be an effective method of putting Russia on the back foot, putting the Western alliance on the front foot, and giving us the opportunity to build the coalition that is currently supporting Ukraine. So as I said earlier, hindsight's always 2020. In hindsight, would you have exited Afghanistan differently than the way you did it? Well, at the end of the day, anytime you have a circumstance where you're ending a 20-year war with 20 years of decisions and mistakes that have piled up through multiple administrations, the exit would not be easy. There was no clean, easy exit. And I think the strategic decision to go and that war after 20 years was absolutely the correct decision, where there are things that we could have done differently. I think the answer to that is always yes. And there will be time as I end up looking back and reflecting on that period to pinpoint what some of those might have been. But from my perspective, the underlying decision to end the war in Afghanistan, which the president took, I think, in a quite courageous way, was the correct decision. And one year later, to me, the time that has passed has only reinforced the correctness of that decision. Many people have held your job, have a burnout after a few years. You look like you're in good shape and you're young. You're the second youngest person ever to have this job. So you anticipate doing this for an entire four-year period of this first term. If it's another term, let's say this four-year period of time. Well, I serve at the pleasure of the president, but I feel passionate about the work that I'm doing. I feel blessed to be part of this team. I feel blessed to be able to serve President Biden. I then would like to keep doing it. We don't have enough women, founder CEOs, who are getting funding. So basically, less than 2% of VC funds go to women, less than 1% go to women of color. And so in this innovation space, I said to myself, what's the best way to use capital to move things for women? And that's when I started to say, OK, I actually need to move some money into the venture capital space. And I want to do it smartly. I mean, the first goal is to make money. I'm not putting my money out as a social impact. I'm putting it out to make money. But I wanted to go behind funds like aspect ventures that's run by Theresa Gao and Jennifer Fonsdatt, who are looking at these opportunities. And they have a thesis around my gosh. There are so many opportunities there if we go towards funding some of these women businesses. Some LPs have said to me, all we care about is returns. Some of the best investors may not be the best people, but they have the best returns. What do you have to say to those people? I have to say you're investing in what you know. And so you need to look at what trends are coming in the nation and how you're going to dress them. Women are 85% of consumer dollars spent. Women control 70% of financial decisions in the house. So if you're not investing in products that go towards females or women led company, you're missing an opportunity because you just don't see it.

So Katie, anything going on in the world of crypto over the last week? There's a life-altering event in the world of crypto this past week. You're talking about FTX's bankruptcy. I am. It's huge. It is huge. Well, we've got Bloomberg TV for all the breaking news, but we want to talk about crime. And it's not necessarily crime associated with the downfall of FTX. Innocent until proven guilty. It is being investigated. But a different type of crime when it comes to crypto. Specifically, Bitcoin and crime. And whether or not Bitcoin is actually good for crime. And whether it needs to be for thinking about money laundering. Bitcoin has been closely associated with crime since pretty much the beginning. In the early days, it was the currency of choice on the dark web, used in drug deals and even a murder for higher plot. In more recent years, it's been what hackers have demanded when they've held pipelines, hospital systems, and meatpacking plants hostage. And then there've been the hacks. October 2022 is on track to see more crypto stolen and hacks than any other month this year. And 2022 is on pace to be a record according to chain analysis. But is Bitcoin actually good for crime? Since all transactions are public on the blockchain, everyone can see Bitcoin move on the blockchain. And governments and other organizations are getting better at recovering stolen Bitcoin. Plus, it's not actually that easy to launder Bitcoin to turn lots of it into real usable money. This raises an important question. If Bitcoin isn't good at crime, then how can it live up to its promise as a stateless currency that could allow people in oppressed areas to transact with one another without a regulator seeing what they're up to? Joaz and Thal of the AdLots podcast, we're not going to get into the FTX collapse. But you wrote back in February that it's time for Bitcoin and crypto in general to get better at crime. And we're talking about a different type of crime that FTX is being investigated for potentially more along the lines of money laundering. So lay out your case for us. Well, you know, one of the core arguments that like Bitcoiners make is that it's like separation of money and state. Right? And that it's a sort of form of money that doesn't rely on the government. It doesn't rely on traditional banking system, etc. And when I wrote the piece, it was, if you recall, it's like during the Canadian trucking protest of those that big convoy. And sitting aside, what one's view of the protestware, which I think is like kind of irrelevant to the question, the point is, if there's going to be a moment where people needed a form of money that could like, they could transact without censorship. That was it. And it didn't really work for that. They were able to like very easily track the transactions. They were able to like freeze wallets from like interacting with banks. So it's like, if Bitcoin is going to live up to its promise of being a means of transaction that is separate from the state, separate from the financial institutions, I don't think it's there yet in terms of whether it's privacy or obfuscation or things like that. So you're essentially saying that if Bitcoin is to live up to its promise of being this stateless currency, something that could help and oppress people.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,941,2022-11-19 18:34:55
18328," So you're essentially saying that if Bitcoin is to live up to its promise of being this stateless currency, something that could help and oppress people, then it actually needs to be something that would also be good for criminals. I think that that would be the implication, because again, what's a criminal in one country or one city could just be a protestor somewhere else. So to some extent, this distinction is going to be very vague. Well, some places, like protest is crimes, some plays, free speech is crime. And so the point is that for it to like, yeah, fulfill its mission, then on some level, there has to be a way to transact with it without the state being able to say, you got these coins and now these coins that they ever go to an exchange, if they ever go to like a fiat off ramp, they'll be frozen. What is the point then? I think part of the reason I've been thinking about this column that you wrote for, I don't know, eight, nine months, is that it kind of made me think that crime is really subjective. Yeah. Like crime to one person to one government is not a crime to another government. Yeah, right. Like there are certain categories of crimes that everyone would find to be like absolutely horrific. Mission kill people. Absolutely. But there are other, yeah, in different situations, like, you know, sending someone or selling a copy of the Bible might be a crime in some countries or a different religious text or any other sort of like protest or whatever it is. And so yeah, that's exactly right. Like how would you even begin to conceive of a currency that would work for what we would call like legitimate crime or legitimate dissidents within a country if it didn't work for things that we would consider to be reprehensible? But it works to a certain extent. And that's what it seems like at least because we are seeing still ransomware attacks that yeah, or, you know, yeah, essentially say pay us X Bitcoin. Or else, yeah, although even even ransomware attacks, there's a pretty big loss of market share by Bitcoin that we've seen till like some of the privacy coins. Like I think like if you look around like Manero, which is much smaller, less liquid, less market cap point, it's still popular among ransomware attacks in part because of this reason it's like has privacy built into it from like, wait, so if you're a criminal and you want to do some crime, which is like, I would never suggest, but I do think that it speaks to again like ransomware is really bad. So this is not about that. The point is like, well, then if it doesn't work for these, then what are like the sort of like freedom sort of like outside the state, outside the financial institutions, use cases that it does work for because the point that I see is like, okay, they say it's like no one can block Bitcoin transaction, no one can censor it, but isn't it a defective form of censorship if an entity can say these wallets can no longer move to an exchange. And I think that's an important sort of set up there that you can do the hack and get Bitcoin in exchange. Yes. It's just you can't really do anything with the Bitcoin that you write in. You know, there's all kind of like chain analysis is getting better and better. So it gets it becomes easier to like connect an individual to a wallet and so forth and like law enforcement and private software companies are getting like really good at this. But if there is a point where it's like really hard to disassociate a coin from a human name from someone that is known to officials, then you start to, I think, lose some of the promise of the currency. Yeah. Sort of anything really. Well, that's it. It's a whole different episode. The philosophy show. Joe, why isn't all this was a delight. Thank you for having me. I'd love to be back. Big expensive cities have a lot going for them. But if you live in one, you probably notice that these big expensive cities keep getting more well expensive. You could always move away. You might have just started working remotely. So there's really nothing keeping you there. But then again, moving is a hassle. Well, what if someone paid you 10 grand to do it? What if they threw in free office space, a bicycle or a gym membership? Programs and cities and states around the US are doing exactly that. And they're getting a lot of interest. We've had over 50,000 applications. About 90,000 applications. We've had over 1800 applicants from all over North America.

It's good to have you both here with us. How are you? Great. Things are having us. What do you think of the crime scene? It's great. Very realistic. Is this what it's like when you investigate a crypto crime? In the digital world, this is exactly what it's like. With all the coins. All the coins, the yellow crime scene. You've ever seen committed with crypto. If I go back to my days when I was with the Drug and Force Administration, it was with drug traffickers and anywhere from drug trafficking with money laundering using crypto for drug cartels or your run-of-the-mill individuals that were down in the government parent's basement selling drugs on the internet. Those are shocking in the end of themselves and how the individuals actually benefited from it and leveraging crypto for that. When I think about drugs and Bitcoin and I think about them both together, I think about Silk Road. Is that the sort of stuff that we're talking about? Yeah, so kind of both. The very first really play of drugs and crypto is Silk Road. That was one of the most innovative spaces for somebody to be like, how do I get this onto the Black Market? Without being detected by law enforcement. And then this was the generation of leveraging TOR and the digital realm of what payments system was, which was crypto. And that's what created Silk Road. So for the traditional sense of the digital aspect for drug trafficking, that would be what it is. However, anytime you have a type of crime, you can leverage crypto for that. So drug trafficking and the traditional sense where you have the actual bulk movement of large kilos of drugs, individuals can still accept payment with that through crypto. So you get same question. Most shocking crime using Bitcoin. The word necessarily shocking to me, because Kribeynel's often go where the sort of technology is. But the first time I was really struck by how interesting crypto really could be was when I read the indictments, charging those Russian intelligence.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,943,2022-11-19 18:43:29
18330," but where the sort of technology is. But the first time I was really struck by how interesting crypto really could be, was when I read the indictments, charging those Russian intelligence officers with interfering in the elections in 2016. Because if you read those indictments, you'll see that intelligence officers were using crypto to buy servers within the United States to try to sort of obscure their tracks and use that to basically purchase the infrastructure that they then used to launch the hacks into the DNC emails and all that. They even hosted the website that sort of hosted all that information through the payment of crypto. So when I was in a senior role at the Justice Department, that's for the first time I realized, wow. I mean, crime is very important and all the stuff we're doing on sort of dark webs, really important, but there's a foreign intelligence component to this. There's a defending democracy component to this. But ultimately, those individuals weren't di-ed. They weren't di-ed. And the allegations are really indictment. Right. In the indictment, you see the evidence of them using what was a Bitcoin? Correct. Various types of crypto. So the question will, we'll keep the question to Bitcoin for now and then take it out to other types of crypto. But does that mean that it is or is not an effective means to essentially commit crime with? So it can be traced, right? And this is something that criminals often don't realize is that the Bitcoin network itself is quite traceable and folks like my team at TRM labs, Beth's team of channeluses have become very good at tracing those payments. So is it just dumb criminals at this point then? Because I feel like at least, I don't know, maybe I spend too much time in my own bubble, but I feel like it's pretty well known that you can track things on the blockchain by now. Well, I think a lot of people maybe don't realize that. The other thing is it still takes time, right? You've got technology like mixers and other types of technology that will help you sort of mix up the transactions a little bit. Even that capability is something that law enforcement can see through using the right and the effective tools. But there's a lot of crime out there and there's limited resources for law enforcement. Okay, so we talked about shock. Let's talk about scale. Because when I think about Silk Road, that was a long time ago. Where does the state of crime using crypto stand right now? So if you look past like Silk Road, that was one marketplace. When Silk Road was taken down, it kind of like did this whack-a-mole type of thing where it dispersed and criminals were like, oh, that's a really ingenious idea in order for me to actually do my criminal activities. So you see this mold that then is being expanded within that. But if you go past just like darkened markets and drug trafficking or even the aspects of child exploitation sites are also being leveraged on that, the other type of crime is not necessarily financially driven. So we've seen individuals that have taken advantage of the Bitcoin blockchain and have been able to put messaging within the transactions so that it's encrypted and these are botnets that then crawl the blockchain in order to decrypt that to then infiltrate different aspects. So what we saw with this was a bunch of crypto-draking that was actually occurring. So rather than just seeing the transaction that was occurring well on a financial aspect, this is now being deployed for a cyber component as well. I mean something we noticed just a few weeks ago is ISIS is trying to raise funds through the use of NFTs. Completely novel application of the technology. The technology is amazing, it's great. But illicit actors can also use it in novel ways that are actually pretty concerning. How are they trying to do that? So basically you create sort of an NFT and use that as a means of collecting funds. And so our team at TRM was able to identify that in advance and essentially notify law enforcement and its since been taken down. It doesn't look like they had actually mobilized the NFT yet. They were basically doing the preparatory work. I assume those NFTs weren't like Pudgy Pan, Gwins, or whatever. I wish. But you bring up actually my next question, which is like I actually just don't get how ISIS would do this with an NFT. Like explain how this would work. Well essentially you would send funds to that NFT, right? You would use that digital representation to store value. And I mean to say that NFT would be not associated officially with a terrorist organization. Correct. You wouldn't realize that at the time that you were setting it, though people in the know would know to send and it would evade detection. Right. So you're essentially setting up a bank account that is unlinked to any entity in order to raise funds for terrorists. Right. Essentially you would be receiving funds in a digital manner that's not.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,944,2022-11-19 18:48:06
18331," funds for terrorists. Right. Essentially, you would be receiving funds in a digital manner that's not tied to any particular KYC information, right? No, your customer. No, your customer. And you would then use that and sort of move it off, you know, move it to other chains or other areas and then try to turn it into cash. So to that point, I feel like ISIS wouldn't have been using NFTs, I don't know, three, four years ago. I know you both have been involved in the space for a long time. Beth, I know that you've been looking at, you know, illicit activities using crypto since 2014. We've touched on some of this, but tell me how the use case has evolved since then. Has it gotten more creative? How has it changed? Oh, it's definitely more creative. So I like to always think back, like, back in the good old days with Bitcoin, because it's no longer the good old days, where like the technology has advanced and all of these different aspects of cryptocurrency have popped up. So you have NFTs. You now have all the DeFi tokens that are available and the platforms that are operating in that manner that it's hard to keep up with all of that. So not only are you having individuals that are still in the Bitcoin realm, but they're now transitioning into the DeFi space. And there's so many advancements with that with blockchains on top of other blockchains. And just being able to understand what that technology represents, as well as how criminals are using that technology for what it does not necessarily represent, right? And to me, that's the evolution that will always continue. And being able to understand how it's being leveraged is one of the most interesting things for the evolution of what cryptocurrency is. Is it kind of easy to make money as a criminal using crypto? I would say there are ways to take advantage of the systems, for sure. So you have platforms now where you can stake funds, right? And you can stake that with criminal funds. And so like you actually are earning money and interest on all of these different things that are actually illicitly earned. I'm wondering if what you heard from Joe Weisenthal makes sense that this stuff in order for it to actually serve its promise as a stateless currency and help people who are oppressed, it has to become better at crime. Because what you guys do, a TRM at a chain analysis, like you track this stuff, something that we know can be tracked now, but people had this idea that it wasn't trackable. Well, look, I think privacy is very important, right? And so, you know, at TRM, for example, we don't touch personal sensitive data. It's all the blockchain information is publicly available. It's on a public blockchain and you can trace it over time. Which is what Joe was saying is why it's not good for crime. Right. And just because something isn't necessarily good for crime doesn't mean that it's a bad thing, right? There's a lot of positive use cases for crypto generally or for distributed ledger technology, which is what all of the stuff is based on that, you know, often people are overlooking, right? I mean, think about, you know, the last time you tried to send funds to if you've got relatives and other parts of the world, you know, in the traditional banking system, it takes days, there's fees everywhere and it takes forever. It costs a lot of money. And it costs a lot of money. And with crypto and you need a bank account on both sides. If you were a criminal, would you use crypto or would you play the cash in a suitcase and sort of try to shovel around that way? So can I give you my honest answers? Please. I'm not a criminal. Be honest. Okay. That's all right. This is a brain exercise though. It requires us to suspend reality. I mean, look, cash is still king when it comes to illicit activity, right? Crypto is certainly a means of doing illegal things, but there are aspects that are more traceable, there are aspects that make it more obfuscatable, like mixers and other kinds of technology. So I certainly wouldn't be in the business of advising criminals what to do or what not to do. Beth, Sujit's talked a lot about state actors and I'm wondering in your work, if you have any data that shows to what extent the crime is being committed by state-sponsored actors versus by rogue individuals with no connection to a state. Yeah. So what we were able to identify is that for nation state actors, there's over $400 million that we have been able to tie to North Korea for instance, right? However, if you look at just individual illicit actors within that, although the hacks are very large, so $600 million at a time for a hack, right? It makes and grabs attention for headlines. However, what is...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,945,2022-11-19 18:52:27
18332," within that, although the hacks are very large, so $600 million at a time for a hack, right? It makes and grabs attention for headlines. However, what is not being looked at are individuals that are still soliciting, um, illicit means, but they're doing it in a large, a smaller scale, but a higher transaction rate. So that actually supersedes the amount that's actually being moved on the illicit scale for that. That's really interesting and I swear I'm just curious. So if you were committing a crime, it sounds like just a series of smaller transactions makes a lot more sense. In any type of movement for financial means that that is the best way, right? So, um, being, so in a traditional financial aspect, right, there's reporting requirements in order to, for transactions that hit a banking system, right? And so, um, and those are the suspicious activity reports that financial institutions and money service businesses are actually supposed to report. So if you're underneath that threshold, like you're not going to be able to, um, be reported on as easily, uh, $10,000 for funds that are going on. You know, in all seriousness, um, all this talk of state actors kind of has me thinking about whether or not all of this is actually a good development or not. And I'm wondering, you know, North Korea recently launched a missile over Japan and sent, you know, shockwaves throughout the world. And they do this every once in a while. And I'm wondering, so did if you think North Korea would be as powerful as it is today and as much of a menace to the rest of the world, if there was no such thing as crypto. Yeah, I think you can strip the crypto conversation out of that because North Korea has been engaging in this kind of maligned cyber activity for years. They tried to steal, I think it was a billion dollars from the Bank of Bangladesh a few years ago, but basically hacking into the federal reserve New York's account that the Bank of Bangladesh was using and siphoning that money out. Nothing to do with crypto, right? It was just a cyber hack. So crypto certainly makes it, you know, a more interesting conversation because there are certain things that nation state actors can do that they couldn't do more, you know, as easily in a purely kind of analog world. Do you guys like crypto? I mean, do you see you guys look at the worst side of crypto when you zoom out from that? I mean, do you see this as a net positive or what are your feelings? All right, it's definitely a net positive. Like it's innovation at its finest and it's really fascinating to be able to watch. Being able to step back and see that individuals that maybe in underprivileged areas that have access to financial means through crypto is fantastic. And just being able to leverage that in a way that makes it where almost everybody can be on the same playing field to me is one of the most rewarding things within this space. Would you agree with Sujit that we have to strip crypto out of the conversation there because even if there were no crypto, these sanctioned countries would still be able to access funds to fund whatever they're doing? Yeah. And like I would actually say that the crypto aspect is actually a positive thing with it. And I say that because it is transparent for us to be able to actually track those funds and actually see what is going on within those different countries, which is if you took the crypto out of it like completely, we would lose insight into what's actually going on and we wouldn't be able to tie that back to us. Does it Sujit undermine American foreign policy at all? So look, that's a really interesting question. Obviously, certain countries are trying to use crypto to kind of evade the international global financial system, which is very much US-led or at least led by kind of Western countries and Western values. But here's an interesting kind of other side to it. You talk about stable coins, right? Which are basically tied to the US dollar. I could see a world in which if there was more expansion of stable coins, that actually promotes the growth of the US dollar into areas where it maybe doesn't exist now. So you know, crypto again cuts both ways. You've got to really understand it and then you can make good policy. Who's your favorite TV cop? Like who do you model yourself after? Well, I was not a cop. I was a prosecutor. So if you watch Law and Order, yes. I always identified with the lawyers, but I did like the guys in Law and Order. Gotta be honest.

Really good news on the jobless claims. What are you thinking about those dynamics? Is our business Bloomberg TV and radio. The world is listening. When the price of anything goes up, the consequences reach far beyond what you'd expect. But perhaps most of all, when it comes to food. In 2010, surging food prices helped spark the Arab Spring. Lives were lost, regimes fell and the consequences are still with us. Once again, food prices are rising and fast. Energy costs, broken supply chains and surging demand were just some of the factors that have driven food prices to their first record high since the Arab Spring. And that's all before a war between two of the world's biggest food producers. Ukraine is called the bread basket of Europe and taken with Russia the two account for about a quarter of global wheat trade. They produce more than half of the world's sunflower seeds in oil nearly 20% of the barley. Now throw in rising energy prices and processing, transporting, even refrigerating food gets more expensive. Plus, fertilizer production is extremely energy intensive. Less fertilizer means lower crop yield and prices rise even more. The pandemic revealed how complicated and fragile global trade systems are. Global agriculture, perhaps even more so. Unlike metals, for example, food goes bad. And crops take months to grow and are vulnerable to unpredictabilities like the weather. Rising food prices will be felt everywhere, but the poorest countries in the world will be hit the hardest. And as all these factors compound, the real fear is that record high will lead to record high and ultimately to a global food crisis with vast consequence. When koplet rain again, the episodes of which swimming mixed with August topic are all expressed in U.S. It is crucially important and I think we've moved from this attitude from its indulgence a waste of time, almost an illness that needs a cure.

I guess this week is the award-winning Nigerian writer and author, Jim Amanda Nungotsi Aditriet, named by Time magazine as one of its most influential people. Her writing covers everything from war to feminism to most recently a very person take on grief having lost both of her parents in quick succession. I want to ask her about being described as fearless for speaking her mind and also what it was like to team up with Beyonce to try and promote feminism. Jim Amanda, welcome. It's so lovely to have you with me on this program and see you in person. I know. Thank you, Emma for having me. It's lovely to see you. Well, the last time we spoke was last year and you had just penned a short book called Notes on grief. We were talking in a difficult time for you. But you wanted to talk about losing your father and then losing your mother. And you said to me you were trying to understand grief and process it. And I wanted to start by asking how you are today. Well, I think I'm learning that a lot of living is sort of pretending to be fine. So I'm I think they're doing that very well. Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine. Thank you for asking. But I do know I think everything happy that happens to me now is always tainted. But kind of sort of like a residual sadness. And it's because I just adored my parents and it still feels very, very disorienting for me. How about? Yeah. I mean, you talk about those stages as well, you know, coming undone, feeling unmoored. But you're right about the world expects you to get back to some place and you have your responsibilities as well. And you do, you just sort of, you know, you, but you carry something with you always. And I, it's interesting because I thought that I would be more aware of this, this kind of emptiness in my life when I'm sad. But actually it's when I'm happy. It's when I'm having a lovely day and suddenly I think I go, I can't, you know, I can't face time, daddy. And I had a thing in the US last month where I got a lovely medal. And I love those things because I just love shiny things. And all I could, I really, I really did want to take my food and face time my parents because that's what I have done my whole life. When I've been given something meaningful, you know, it's to call my parents. Well, they're the people who know who cheer you up. Yeah. So really, I really, I really was going to first time them and though, we, I can't. And so it's those moments that are really just painful. Something else you said, which has stayed with me is the idea that we live in this world. And we know death's a part of it. And we're still so surprised. It's incredible. And even when we see it as I do now, life is short. You really need to think about what matters and how you want to live. It's also at the same time a strange thing to live life, always thinking about death. Because in a way, death is sort of the, you know, it's the on life. It's the, it's the not life. So it's a strange thing, I think. I mean, I do want to, I think a lot changed for me when my parents died. In the way that I think about life and how I want to live. But I think death is still surprising. It still is. One of the ways, I mean, I don't know how much this speaks to you, but people talk about faith and that helping them through these sorts of times.

18335," speaks to you, but people talk about faith and that helping them through these sorts of times. Do you have that in your life? Have you come back to that? It's very complicated. After my father died, I started, I was raised Catholic. You know, some Catholic. Well, raised Catholic. There's a difference, I think, from me, between being Catholic and being raised Catholic. One doesn't have a choice in one. The other you kind of have a choice. And I started going to mass because I found it, I found it soothing, but particularly because it was what my father did. My father was just, you know, this lovely, faithful Catholic. But then I started, I had trouble with the Catholic church in Nigeria. And I was so angry that I stopped going. And it's a long story, but I'll just say very briefly that when my mother died, my mother's funeral at a priest used the opportunity of my mother's funeral to attack me about an interview I had given. And so, imagine just sitting there is being completely lost because you still do not understand what happened. Your mother has gone and my mother died so suddenly. And a priest at a funeral takes the microphone and says, you know, she was attacking the church because she says the church is too obsessed with money which they are, which I said, but my mother's funeral. So that made me so angry and I haven't been back since. Did you say anything at the time? Oh, I did. I got up and I said, you know, I need to speak because you cannot do this. And I then sort of, I did spend a lot of times sort of seeking redress, writing to bishops and nothing. I think how religious institutions use their power over individuals, but also how intersects with politics is in people's minds, especially in America at the moment since Roe v. Wade with the overturning of that ruling. And I wanted to ask you about it because we see in Christianity with Christianity it being used by politicians, by legislators to defend the rowing back of those particular rights for women. And you've of course are very well known for speaking out about feminism and the rights of women. You know, someone raised Catholic. How do you look at that and that situation? Well, the first thing I think is that one should never impose one's religious views on anyone in the democracy. And I've often felt quite respectful of those people who for religious reasons do not support or want to have abortions. I think that's fantastic for them, right? But to somehow insist that a woman doesn't have a right to do what she wants with her body and to and to then justify that using religion, I think it's just completely unacceptable for democracy. It just it makes no sense to me. I mean, for me being Catholic doesn't mean sort of agreeing with everything. Even when I was a child, growing up, I was a bit of a I think at Catholicism classes, I think that they were irritated with me because I would sort of poke holes at the some of the things that we were being taught. If collectively as a society, we really believe that women are equal, we would not be having this conversation. If you step back and think about it, it's actually almost surreal to say, your body doesn't belong to you. It's a very strange thing, I think.

We have a global emergency now. You know, we're still putting 162 million tons of manmade global warming pollution into the sky every day, using the sky as an open sewer. That's trapping as much extra heat as would be released by 600,000 erosion of the class of Tommy Klum exploding every day. That's what the scientists tell us and the data shows it. That's crazy. That's why we have a third of Pakistan underwater. That's why we have the historic heat wave in China. Nothing comparable to that ever. That's why the heat records are broken every year. And we're seeing an increase in the flows of climate refugees crossing international borders that are due to vastly expand unless we take action to solve the climate crisis. Nobody covers climate change like Bloomberg, your global business authority. A lot of people describe you as fearless now. You know, in this age that we live in, where social media was meant to liberate us. Allow us to share. But it has in presenters. And there's a real concern in particular that women are being pushed out of the public square, not saying what they really think. Do you have that concern? For myself, no. For women, yes. You know, when I'm called fearless, I guess it's nice. But I don't really think of myself as fearless. I've always, this is what I've always been, really. I think part of the reason I'm so fiercely feminist about the way I look at the world is that I knew from a very young age that to be a girl and to be as I was, which are sort of outspoken, asking questions, was kind of seen as odd. So even now, I think, is sort of an ostensibly foregrounded woman, to be told, you really see what you think. It's a thing that's a compliment for women, not for men. But I think we're also living in times where to say what you think has also become something that people are called fearless for. Yes, that's true. And to use your word from earlier, has a surrealism to it. I know it's only one platform, but it is the platform, a lot of the time of debate in terms of social media with Twitter now being run by Elon Musk. Some people, men and women, have left the platform in process equally. Others are saying, now there will be or could be real freedom of speech. Do you have a view on that? I don't think one person should be in control of a platform that has that kind of outsized social influence. I just don't think it makes sense. And people can say, oh, well, we've bought it. It's here or before they would say, oh, they're just really beholden to only their shareholders. But I think it's a public utility. We should think of it as a public utility. So it really shouldn't be one person. This is the way we live now, sadly. We have to figure out a way to make this sound like a preacher. We need to do better. But I really think we do. I don't think we can change how we use the platforms. I really detest this kind of piling on that happens when people have said something that somebody doesn't like. And it's not just that you criticize them. It's that you publicize their address. You put their children's schools online, that sort of thing. And we try to get them to lose their jobs. I have just never felt that that is in any way a reasonable response to bad speech. But I also sometimes wonder why there isn't more that's done to those who pile on on people. So you know, so often we'll say, oh, that's terrible. But that's it. Twitter, but I think if I were...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,950,2022-11-19 19:14:05
18337," those who pile on on people. So, you know, so often we'll say, oh, that's terrible, but that's it. I'm not in Twitter, but I think if I were, and there's a reason I'm not, it just would not go well. Because I think I would go after the people who pile on people and be like, you're just a piece of, and you need to stop. I mean, you have had people, even though you're not on that platform, be very upset about various things that you've said. And has that affected you? Yes, I know. I think, so in general, I think this idea that we're supposed to say that we're fine when you hear that the tons of people maligning you publicly, to say that I'm fine, it would be to lie. And I think it's either you're lying or you're inocentist. Because how can you not be affected by it? And so, when I first, the first time that I heard all those saying that you're terrible and that you're immoderate, I was just deeply hurt. I was deeply, deeply hurt. What was that after? Was that after something you'd say? Yes. Okay. Yeah. Well, surely, I mean, I didn't kill anyone. Yeah, no, I was just, there was something. It's a check in interviews. There were some people I would like to kill, no, I'm kidding, I'm kidding. So it was very hurtful, but it won't make me change. It will not make me change how I live my life. It hasn't, and it won't. I'm still going to say what I think. So you don't, you haven't self-sensored. Because that's the real risk here, isn't it? Yeah. When we get into this position. Yeah. Because I did notice you have not wanted to answer questions about when you said in an interview, for instance, trans women are women. Yeah. And not necessarily to go into that issue, per se, but I wonder why you haven't wanted to talk about that. No, what I haven't wanted to do is say more. But I've said, I've said what I said, and that's what I think. And why not say more because of the reaction, or you think? Well, because it's been said, I just think. Yeah, because I just think also that this is the sort of this age of, of, you know, like a friend of mine said, you said what you said. Anybody asking you more about this is just trying to sort of sort of stoke outrage and make it more of a thing. And which was never my intention. And I said what I said, it's what I believe, it's what I still believe. But then having people say to me, you know, tell me more, tell me more, I'm just like, no. And also, you know, I have a full life. There are many, many things I'm interested in. And yeah. I suppose, I mean, when people have thought about that particular issue in gender and sex, there's a lot of talk now about J.K. Rowling. Yeah. And how she's continued to share views and be very alive on platform, such as Twitter, to this particular topic. But there's now a bit more of people in the public eye who've worked with her coming forward to say exactly about freedom of speech, that why has she been treated in this way? Why has there been this? And I wonder if things are changing or turning. I don't know what you'll take. Is I don't know if you ever spoken to her about? No, no, no, I haven't spoken to her. But I read. So when I started reading about how she was being attacked, I then went and read what she'd written, which I thought was perfectly reasonable. And I did not see why she needed to be attacked. And I think that she's been treated abominably. And I think a lot of that treatment is because she's a woman. I think that a man who aired his views, reasonable views, would not be treated in that way. And there's also something very dangerous about refusing to engage with what she said, but instead making it sort of hurling insults. When I read how I remember reading what she'd written, an underlying in bits, because of the... This is the essay on sex in general. Yeah, underlying in bits of it, because some young people in Lagos had said, oh, she's terrible, she's transformed, big, she wants to kill trans people. And so I said to them, where does it say that here? And I don't even need any literal sense, because there are ways that you can read something to mean something else, but none of them could point it out to me. And I suppose this goes to one of the essays you wrote, called It's Obscene. You talk about cancel culture and lots of other things in there. But you do express this concern out at this particular...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,951,2022-11-19 19:18:37
18338," And I suppose this goes to one of the essays you wrote called It's Obscene. You talk about cancel culture and lots of other things in there. But you do express this concern at this particular quote you say, we have a generation of young people on social media, so terrified of having the wrong opinions, that they've robbed themselves of the opportunity to think and to learn and to grow. You talk to young people, you lecture them, I saw recently told them to get offline for three weeks and read some books. It's a serious issue and I know you're probably thinking about it as well as a parent. But what can we do about this? We can try being adults, you know. I sometimes feel as though we have abdicated our responsibility as the grown ups because I know what it was like to be young. I thought I knew everything. Now I look back and I'm like, I just knew nothing. I was wrong in many of my fears positions. And I was fortunate that when I was young, there were adults who were willing to tell me, you're actually really not right about that. Here's what you should think about differently. That's not happening now. We're also not saying to young people, you cannot, I mean, so I remember talking to students at a university in the US and it really made me sad because until, well, first of all, we meet and we're sort of talking, I'm asking them questions. And they're really, it felt as though they were repeating party lines in a way about just general issues. I think it's tough for them. And I just, you know, so I sort of did a little preaching and I said, you know, can we all agree on compassion? Can we all agree that, you know, not everyone means harm? Can we all agree that people can learn and people change? You know, just sort of basic things that we seem to have forgotten, I think. You know, there are lots of things I don't know. I mean, there are things that I don't understand. I mean, and again, not to go about to the famous, the trans woman is a trans woman. I thought I was saying something obvious. I did not mean to offend anyone. And but later I thought, wait, what if I made things I don't understand? So I went back and I said, I'm reading things because I just thought I really didn't understand what the noise was about. And so I think about young people and I think, I'm sure there are many people in my position, which is to say, do not know the orthodoxy, right? And who should be giving a chance to know it and then choose whether to accept it or reject it? I don't think that they're giving that chance. Yeah. And also, they don't feel they have the space necessarily to have those conversations. A lot of people want to hear, I suppose, where your feminism is up to. And I wonder because feminism in that time is less of a dirty word, certainly in the Western world. It's being sold as a brand. It's by fashion, by the media. And I, but I wonder if it has achieved what it's meant to have achieved yet. No, of course not. It's not going to achieve it in the next 100 years. It took a long time for us to get here. I mean, we've had really human history, the sort of the length of time that we've been here on earth. We've had men sort of being charged. And if we're going to achieve equality, it's going to take a long time. So that doesn't, I think for me, maybe the question I would be interested in is, are we taking a few steps forward? But at the same time, we're seeing marching or seeing protests. And since the death of Massa Amini in Iran, who was held by Iran's morality police for not covering her hair property, she died on the 16th of September, those protests are carrying on led by women in Iran. And also in Afghanistan, women trying to go back to university or their jobs since the Taliban took over. It's very striking. There's a footage going of a woman being, a few women being whipped by Taliban. Oh, I saw that this morning. Outside of the university. But chanting women life freedom, which is the same words chosen by women in Iran. And while it's awful what's being denied, there's also something in what's being said. Oh, I find it enormously inspiring. I think that they are just absolute stars. I mean, there's particularly the women in Iran and Afghanistan, because you think about what the stand.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,952,2022-11-19 19:22:47

And I felt that that whipping video is such a dramatic example of what their lives are like, but they're still pushing back. I just find it so inspiring. And the women in Iran, when they're cutting their hair and they're throwing the thing in the fire, I actually was weeping watching one of the videos. It was incredibly emotional to see.

And that's what you bring figures out while you're sleeping. I always wondered if you found it frustrating that some came to your work through Beyonce as opposed to finding you themselves. You know, I mean, I... No, well, I'll tell you one of the reasons that I wasn't happy to say yes. Because she just to say if people don't know, she took some of your words, sampled some of your words for a song about something. It's because I thought that she has such a huge following that they're going to be people who have never heard the word feminism, and if I thought about it, who will because of this? And for me, that's a wonderful thing. But to have people come to my readings and say, oh, I never heard about you then, then I heard you and Beyonce. And then they don't want to ask me anything about my books. They want to ask me, so Beyonce, that doesn't interest me very much. That's a black thing. I'm like, that's not the way this is going to work. No, but I think also there's a part of me that just, I feel the swear about films as well. And people say, oh, it's fantastic. Your book was made into a film. And I'm thinking, it's nice. But I wrote the bloody book. I want to talk about books. I want books to be cool. I want to be excited about books, you know? And we're just not. And it just, you know, I just feel deeply, deeply annoyed by that. But it's, you know, whether we have the wrong hair, I mean, you know, we look at the world. And I'm not very sure. Yeah, I do. I agree. And I also want the responsibility that those here has to have. And I'm wary of talking about this, because I do not like people telling me you a role model, therefore you should not do this. But I think, for example, that Beyonce making the decision and people can think what they will about talking about feminism, I think is a really good thing. Because, and I know for a fact that there are many young people who, because of that, suddenly, I mean, I know relatives, young nieces, who, you know, Auntie talks about feminism, Auntie Wright's books. Beyonce talks about feminism that, like, I'm a feminist. And now they're making what they think are feminist arguments. And I think it's fantastic, because, you know, conversations are happening. It's good to hear that Beyonce help you get closer to your family. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. No, among certain sort of cohort.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,953,2022-11-19 19:27:03
18340," Well, it's good to hear that Beyonce help you get closer to your family. No, among the certain sort of cohort, the family, this suddenly thought, hmm, and this is not too bad. It's okay. Yeah, we can, yeah, just tolerable now. What are you working on now? I cannot tell you. You can't tell me. You don't like saying it, tell us that. Okay, but writing, I imagine, or, hmm, hmm, hmm. Okay. The creativity, though, is it come back since your daughter is it coming? It's slowly coming back. But I think, again, that's amazing for women in particular to be able to hear you say that because, again, it's not something that's talked about for long, after effects. Yes, yes. I think it's really important to talk about. And also to talk about it, knowing that we love that we, we had the gift of motherhood and babies and we adore them. Okay, if you want that. It really is, it really is. But, you know, we should talk about the other things because nobody told me about the, I mean, I had horrible joint pains, my fingers, and, you know, and, and, and nobody told me about the constipation. And I just feel like we need to talk about these things. And you laugh at when I say constipation, which apparently is a puzzling response I get from other people as well. And I said, no, we should talk about I, I personally was shocked. And I was like, what's happening in my husband, my husband is a doctor. And he was sort of, oh, you didn't know. And I wanted to punch his face. I was like, of course I didn't know. There's two types of constipation. It was the literal and the creative. So we've come up both. Like that. That's actually fantastic. Thank you very much for talking to me. That's all of us today. It's for the pleasure. Unmemorable, as always. Thank you, Emma. And thank you so much for being with us. Until we meet again, take care and goodbye. I'm a lot's happening on Wall Street. I'm quite encouraged. The center is holding. Need to catch up. This is Bloomberg Wall Street week. I'm David Weston. We've got the information and insight. A lot of these areas still have very, very good valuations from businesses most influential and instrumental. It's knocking it out the bolt. But I was not a great time to be expected to. It's time for a pivot. We're talking about a significant hit to our standard living. Bloomberg Wall Street week live tonight with replays all weekend on Bloomberg television and radio. No one covers the world like Bloomberg. My team thinks 2023. We avoid a recession. I'm a little more skeptical about that. China and the US both do not want to see nuclear force in the European continent. The regulators here in the Bahamas are ongoing with their investigation into ATIAC. With unmatched reach and resources from more than 120 countries, the moment news breaks 24 hours a day. Bloomberg, your global business authority. A lot of the satellites have propulsion systems they can kind of move to get out of the way of each other or change their orbit a little bit. It's a service that you guys offer to help these companies know how to maneuver their machines. Yeah, we offer a collision avoidance service. It's a subscription service. We'll send you an alert up to seven days in advance. If your satellite is going to come dangerously close to a piece of debris or another satellite. Companies have been doing that for decades moving satellites around, but it's sort of like a harder problem now. The risk of a collision is a lot higher now. Just because we've installed so much more hardware into space, you have a big collision. It creates a cloud of debris and now all the other satellites are flying through this whizzing mess of debris. As we add all of the new satellites into space, the risks of the collision, the likelihood of the collisions going up.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,954,2022-11-19 19:31:27
18341," of debris as we add all of the new satellites into space, the risks of the collision, the likelihood of the collisions going up. The global appetite for data is growing faster than ever. And no matter what statistics you use to describe it, big data is big business. We believe 150 billion devices would be connected by 2025. And more than 175 z-abytes of data will be created. Every 18 month, the data that is produced by the world is doubled. We started talking about petabytes and exabytes, and now we're talking about z-abytes. It's a near unimaginable explosion in data, and companies just don't know how to manage and secure all this new information. There's also a growth in the nature and location of data, as well, you know, expanding beyond structure data to unstructured data. We're looking at 500 plus billion in revenue, in market that several years ago or a decade ago didn't really exist. And that's going to 3x to 1.5 trillion in 2030. Are there room for more players in what has been on already pretty competitive space? What you see right now is that the big players are the biggest names intact. You have the chemist, like Microsoft, Google, Amazon is the big three. But the great thing about Cloud and the public clouds, the private clouds, is that it allows a lot of innovation to happen. HPE is a big name tech company with a mission to innovate and compete in the Cloud. CEO Antonio Neri told Romain Bostic why he chose Tarek Robyade, a CFO to drive this transformation. When you play sports, you want different type of skills and capacities in many ways that they all together can deliver a better performance. And it starts by will to win. And when I became CEO, I realized I needed a different type of CFO. Somewhat is way more strategic, not just on the account inside, but really think about how we can deliver that value in a different way. Gone are the days where the CFO is just a scorekeeper. I think our role as CFO is to be the person who assists the CEO change in the score. Well, he had that attracted me was about the transformation experience. Obviously, it has more than two decades as a global leader. We both Italians, by the way, by the core, which I think is a benefit. We can communicate the same language. And we can argue against each other, but always in a constructive way. I think it's a big thing. As CFO, I would assume that you're always in a position where sometimes you have to say no to him. Do you say no to him? Ultimately, decision-making ownership is his, the CEO of the company, his boss is my boss. At the same time, I want to make sure that I watch his back. Tarek Robiyade is HPE's chief financial officer and also oversees the company's strategic function. Being the head of strategy, he does a lot of the market scanning, looking at the trends, whether it's three or five, ten years. And that's why we combine both the CFO with the head of strategy, because in the end, he has to deliver shoulder value. And then we hone into what are the big trends where to play and how to win. Think about it this way. We are like biologists. We need to deeply understand the financial DNA of our company. And we need to take a proactive step, step preventative from aging. Finance is the lifeblood of any organization, just like for a human being, you have to have your heart functioning. We have to be there providing the information that allows us to continue to create value for our shareholders and making sure that our customers get what they want. In 2015, the Hule Packard Corporation split into two separate companies. HPE Inc primarily makes devices from desktop and laptop computers to printers, tablets, and point of sale systems. Hule Packard Enterprise or HPE provides information technology solutions.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,955,2022-11-19 19:35:44
18342," to printers, tablets, and point-of-sale systems. Hewlett Packard Enterprise, or HPE, provides information technology solutions. In 2019, CEO Antonio Mary announced that the company would pivot from a focus on servers and on-site storage systems to its cloud software as a service platform, GreenLake. HPE calls it a hybrid cloud platform, not just storing data in the cloud, but managing it across myriad locations. When I became CEO in 2018, I said that the enterprise of the future would be edge-centric, meaning where we live, where we work, cloud-enabled and data-driven. And one of the things that we saw through the pandemic is that the enterprise became way more distributed, people working everywhere. And at the same time, data became the most important asset that customers have. Explain for a second the difference between the edge there. Why that is more useful, and the idea of a more centralized cloud system that I thought a lot of companies, at least at one point, were embracing. Well, if you think about, we live now in a hyper-connected world, everything is connected. To digitize your enterprise, you need to be connected. It's cheaper to move the cloud to the data, and by the way, more secure, than moving data to the cloud. And that's where we, as a company, we are creating the capability to consume cloud services at the edge in your data center on a bigger cloud. There was a view, and there still is that view, that the whole world is going to move to the public cloud. We think the world is fundamentally going to be hybrid. The edge is where everything happens. Is where people generate data or companies generate data. Think about, for example, logistics companies. How much data is being generated in harbours, in railroads, in warehouses? And the world we're living will be a world which will be much more automated than ever before. So warehouses are going to fundamentally change. They're going to be powered by robots. Those robots will be very quickly picking up the items in the warehouse that are required, and then reshuffle what's in the warehouse. That actual processing requires data analysis locally, where the action happens, transmission of that data over a secured network onto a central point, or multiple central points for that matter, and made sense off, right? So that is the whole idea that we're after. With more data to organize in more places, businesses are moving swiftly to digitize their information infrastructure. Corporate spending on IT soared in 2021, and even if global growth slows, that trend is not likely to reverse. How do you operate that environment? If we are facing recessionary headwinds. What we're seeing with IT spending is we're expecting flattening to single digit growth, but cloud computing will largely be unaffected by that given the explosive nature of data organizations simply need cloud. Companies that once invested heavily in devices and data center servers may now take more flexibility from software that can be upgraded as new needs arise. That's the bet HPE's making as it pivots to software as a service. When you hear the word as a service, so many companies throw that out, something as a service, is that just a buzz word? At the core, it's a different business model. At the heart of it, there is this contract with a service level agreement that ties the two parties for a specific solution. The solution allows the customer to manage the infrastructure and secure a specific business outcome under certain performance conditions. We manage the infrastructure on your behalf. We grow and expand the infrastructure as you need to grow and expand in turn. And so the degree of customer intimacy is a quantum leap above the transactional world. With a different business model comes a different metric for measuring success. Annualized run rate, or ARR, has become the focus for Tarek Robyati and his finance team. The ARR is critical important. The ARR is actually measuring the amount of our revenue that is locked in and recurring with our customer base. And to the extent that the ARR is going fast.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,956,2022-11-19 19:40:03
18343," is actually measuring the amount of our revenue that is locked in and recurring with our customer base. And to the extent that our ARR is going fast, the more robust the future of the company is. And on GreenLake we have to grow customers, we have to grow the revenue we make from those customers, and the ARR is the annualized run rate of revenue that you have from one period to the next. If your offer has a perennial future, it translates into a growing ARR. This is the way for us to truly understand that we remain relevant for our customers over the long term. What about margins? When you hear from some of these analysts, these investors here, there's still dialed in on gross margin, some of the more traditional metrics. Gross margin for me is the most important metric in our sector, right? It's fundamentally, if you think about our business which comes from a hardware heritage moving into as a service, with hardware commoditizing, you have to have a focus on gross margins. And as you can see from our results over the past nine, ten quarters, our gross margin has been expanding very, very solidly. That actually tells you that your customers are willing to pay a premium for what you have to offer. And so what you want to see is a combination of ARR with gross margin expansion and the ARR composition becoming richer and richer with more differentiation thanks to software. That's the journey that we are all. You need to remind people that 75% of our profits are deferred, which means we don't need the impregnated profit to deliver. So that's an opportunity because we have an amazing profit pool called HP.Next. Now being supplemented with HP green lake, which we already have more than six billion dollars in the balance sheet, growing at 100% percent of the record. Supply change challenges and geopolitical turmoil have weighed on earnings in 2022. But with demand for its software continuing to grow and a record breaking backlog of orders, HPE has caused for optimism. Meanwhile, surgeon inflation remains a wild part as the company tries to attract subscribers and maintain margins. We have had to think about inflation permeating across what we do. In what we purchase and whether it's goods or services, we've seen rising costs. We had to therefore be much more disciplined on pricing than ever before. This is not easy and this is also something that has to adjust because you cannot keep pricing, increasing all the time. So you've got to be very dynamic in the way you think about pricing moving forward. Coming up, why a company with deep roots in Silicon Valley just opened a new headquarters in Houston and how it designed its campus for a more flexible future. It's really incumbent on us employers to make sure that we create an environment where our employees feel at ease to come to work if you're supported. This is Bloomberg. HPE Chief Financial Officer, Taurik Robiyade, originally trained as a scientist, earning a master's degree in nuclear physics and electronics. He told remainbostic how those studies set him on his professional path. It did prepare me in terms of my analytical capabilities, but there was a moment in my career where I felt it was really important that I home my financial skills. And then eventually I had to do an MBA majoring in finance and strategic analysis and entrepreneurship. I discovered finance as a discipline. I loved it and ever since then I became a finance person. Highlights from Robiyade's resume include a stint with Lehman Brothers in London and later experiences CEO first with the telecommunications firm CSL in Hong Kong and then with Australia.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,957,2022-11-19 19:44:17
18344," Distant with Lehman Brothers in London and later experiences CEO first with the telecommunications firm CSL in Hong Kong and then with Australian financial services company Flexi Group. He came to the U.S. to serve as CFO at Sprint leading the company's turnaround efforts. I was very lucky I had the opportunity to work in Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Asia and the United States. So I'm truly a global citizen. People ask me, where is home? My answer to that question is, where I'm not. Home for HPE is now just outside Houston, Texas, where the company opened its new global headquarters this spring. For CEO Antonium Neri, the campus is a passion project. I love design, I love art and I felt this was an unique opportunity for me to start with a blank sheet of paper. This was a piece of Latin, nothing, there was nothing here and it's a remarkable in two years we're able to build this 500,000 square feet side with a unique experience digitally enabled in everything we do. HPE has an abandoned Silicon Valley, a number of employees and business units remain based in the Bay Area. But Neri and Robiotti believe the expanded presence in Texas strengthens the company, operationally, financially and culturally. We felt that we have a lot of opportunity to streamline and make the company way more efficient. The reason to move here is to get the best of both worlds. Having a precious healing Texas allows us to recruit and retain talent, particularly on the diverse side of the house. People don't realize that Houston, Texas is the most diverse city in the United States. In this side we have a 25 megawatt data center where a lot of the development gets done from all over the world. The energy cost is significant here in California. I will not be able to sustain that in California. What we're seeing in a more macro environment is that corporations are looking at locations that have a healthier business environment from taxation and regulation. They're looking for places that they can find new talent. IT talent is scarce. What we're finding is that access to talent is still the biggest bottleneck to productivity. Companies on an increasing basis, whether it's Texas or other places in the United States or even globally, are working more towards this hub and spoke model where they might have a center of excellence or a hub in one individual city outside of the main headquarters. Increasingly, we're finding that is happening outside of Silicon Valley. It was a big decision, but it actually, if you put it in the context as to why we made the decision, it actually made sense. We had a longstanding presence here in Houston for the past, I would say, 20 some years since the compact merger. We bought a piece of land. We started building this building. In doing so, we had to also recalibrate how we were building it because the pandemic hit us. We thought about recreating a work environment that is very, very different, that is skated for this new structural way of working, which we call edge-to-office, where people don't always come to the office to work, can work remotely from their homes, their edges. But have to come back to the office for specific reasons such as team meetings, customer meetings, and in general collaboration. With regards to the hybrid work model, do you see that as something that will persist longer term when the pandemic has long gone? Yes, no question, this will persist. And I think we are witnessing right now, a societal change in the way we work. You're no longer going to measure productivity in the same way as in the past. You're going to be focusing on outputs. Never mind what people do in their private times. It doesn't really matter to a company as long as the output is there. HPE launched its edge-to-office hybrid work initiative in the fall of 2020. The new campus is designed without flexible model in mind. We have to admit that the pandemic has had its toll on mental health in the workforce across the world. And so it's really incumbent on us, employers, to make sure that we create an environment where our employees feel at ease, to come to work, they feel supported. And that's why we created the environment that you see. Between this indoor with two amazing buildings and outdoor amenities, we have a truly, you know, experience for their employees that they can host.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,958,2022-11-19 19:48:44
18345," between these indoor with two amazing buildings and outdoor amenities. We have a truly, you know, experience for their employees that they can host customers, they can innovate, they can collaborate, they can socialize. And we have so many events. And I will say the one difference between here and California, this is way more community-driven. So we have a lot of events here, like the famous Chile Cook event. H.P.'s annual Chile Cook Off allows Taric Robiotti to indulge in one of his favorite hobbies. The finance chief is also an avid chef. Cooking has a lot of parallels with finance and being a CFR. There's a lot of indirect satisfaction. You know, you only know that you're doing a good job when you see others people recognizing it. And there's nothing better than when you serve a nice meal to your friends or family who come over. I love to do that. It's hard work, but it's nice. Still ahead, how H.P.E.'s CFO is taking steps to relieve the company's supply chain pain. We have to rethink our network of manufacturing plants. We have to rethink our network of our suppliers. And he outlines the mindset that makes the chief future officer successful. If you start with a view that the world is in constant change and you have to adapt, you have to anticipate on what comes next. The strategic thinking is very key for that purpose. This is Bloomberg. We will never break. Build on a foundation strong enough to stay. We will never break. Have a wide array of zips and the mountains shake. All of them will remain. We will never go. Look at insight into limitless possibilities, knowledge and inspiration to feed your ambition. So before you invent pioneer, disrupt. Before you change the world, Bloomberg. It's growth and customer demand is encouraging. But supply chain disruptions have slowed the company's ability to fulfill those orders. It's a problem that's plagued many industries since the onset of the pandemic, compounded by the war in Ukraine. Nobody including H.P.E. is going to have an easy time with the supply chain. I mean, we started the Justin Time concept in the 70s and it's taking years for organizations to back their way out of that and find a more distributed supplier base, a more local supplier. Tarek Robiyade can't wave a wand and clear the backlog all at once. He told remainbostic he's focused on long-term solutions. The world is a longer flat and that's a practical reality we have to record. And in that context, therefore, it's really important that we get close to where our customers are. And so we have to rethink our network of manufacturing plants. We have to rethink our network of our suppliers. And I think their whole world and the whole IT industry has to find a new equilibrium with supply chains that are designed for speed, resiliency and cost.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,959,2022-11-19 19:52:58
18346," of our suppliers and I think their whole world and the whole IT industry has to find a new equilibrium with supply chains that are designed for speed, resiliency and cost as opposed to just be inefficient and designed around cost. Our goal is to create a supply chain that is very much designed for optimal visibility at every point in time of where components are, where the working progress products are and have the ability to shift production and materials in different continents where we operate. So for example we invested in a manufacturing plant in the Czech Republic because it made a lot of sense for us to have a presence in Europe. This is a really a new reality that we have to navigate. It's not like we went backwards on capacity. In fact capacity has been added, the issues that the man has always any capacity that we ever imagined. So now we need to add capacity. Also we need to transition some of the technologies to the newer nodes and that takes time. Tarek Robyade will play a key role for HPE as it retools to face new challenges. Romain Bostic asked him what skills the CFO needs to truly succeed as a chief future officer. The first quality you need to look for is CFO. It's almost stable stakes, right? It's integrity and it's not about being honest or dishonest. Of course we're all honest but it's integrity or thought in the way you present the fact base which is the data. If you don't have that in a CFO stop looking move on, right? That's the first and foremost thing. The second most important thing is the ability to be strategically agile. It's absolutely critical to be injecting in the work that a CFO performs a strategic thinking. The third I would say if you think about it in these terms we are a little bit the stewards of the resources of the company for the company and for the CEO. We've got to make sure that resource allocation is up to scratch and that we are allocating resources where there is the biggest return possible. And finally we also have to be coaches. We have to coach our colleagues and team members and my job the way I think about it is we have to shine the spotlight on their strength but also at the same time make sure that we understand our weaknesses and are clear about the areas that we need to improve. So a lot of the CFO job is to distill what I simply would say is tough love. It's about being tough right matters and also be encouraging in other circumstances. What's the opportunity here for HPE over the next 10 years? The opportunity for HPE over the next 10 years is to redefine the industry and because we firmly believe with Antonio that the future of the industry is edge to cloud. And I think that there will be a growing acceptance and it starts already you have evidence of it that the future is hybrid and that the future of an enterprise is to become essentially a digital service provider. The pandemic has told us that the enterprises who perform the best during that period were the ones who had digitized their business models. And for an enterprise to digitize their business models they have to think about it edge to cloud and where the company to help them doing so. What do you think is going to be the main challenge for HPE over the next 10 years? Well I would say the main challenge is ourselves. We have to really be recognizing that the opportunity is there for the taking and we have to go after it resolutely and fast. We can't really wait, be complacent and not execute aggressively to capture the opportunity. So it's not to us really and we think with the right focus and with the right team we can get there. How do you expect your role as CFO to change over the next 10 years? My role is constantly in change mode. If you start with a view that the world is in constant change and you have to adapt, you have to anticipate on what comes next. Strategic thinking is very key for that purpose. You also have to make sure that your team is geared towards it, that you understand the demands that this constant change puts on the team. And then you also have to continue to polish your stamina, build a grid that you need to continue to navigate the journey. For someone who maybe got promoted to CFO today? What would you tell them? To just for the first day on the job, what's the best advice you can give them? Enjoy it. It's wonderful. You have a unique vantage point. You're any company to truly understand what's going on? No one.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,960,2022-11-19 19:57:19
18347," First century. Japan's critical role in the global economy is changing as the wild re-calibrate. After decades of stagnation, Japan's leaders are forging a more innovative and sustainable path forward to revitalize the nation. Corporate giants, policymakers and pioneers tell us how they're doing just that. Every week on Japan ahead, right here on Bloomberg Television. Full force celebrating the election victory of former president, Lula Dasilba. With unmatched reach in resources from more than 120 countries, the moment news breaks 24 hours a day. Bloomberg, your global business authority. Thank you Andy so much for coming down. It's really wonderful to have you here in person. It's my pleasure to be here thanks for having me. We actually lived in the same dorm in college just a few years apart. So it's been almost a year since you took over from Jeff as CEO of Amazon. It's been a year of first, the first DocSplit since the.com bloom. The first vote to unionize an Amazon warehouse. Your first Bloomberg technology conference. Thank you. I want to start with a quick report card. In February 2021, Jeff Bezos shocked the world by announcing plans to step down as Amazon CEO. A few months later, he passed the reins to Andy Jassy, his longtime top lieutenant, the architect of one of the company's biggest profit engines, Amazon Web Services. Bezos has stayed on as executive chair, leaving Jassy to navigate a critical inflection point in Amazon's history. How does the company manage market turmoil, rising inflation and regulatory scrutiny, and a push by some warehouse workers to unionize all while keeping customers coming back? Joining me on this edition of Bloomberg Studio 1.0, Amazon's second CEO, Andy Jassy, he joined us from our flagship Bloomberg Technology Summit in San Francisco. I'd like you to grade your view of Amazon's performance. And we've got time later to really dig in. But quickly, how would you grade Amazon's performance over the last year with customers? Well, I think we've, you know, I'm not sure I'm the right person to grade myself during the year or not, but I'll give you my take. I think with respect to customers, I think we've done a lot of good, you know, and I think if you look at during the pandemic, which really has extended till the early part of this year, you know, so much of the PPE and food and essential items and people equipping their home offices were bought from Amazon and, you know, to scale the way we needed to. Remember, in 2020, we grew 39 percent year over year on a $245 billion revenue run rate. I mean, it's very, it's unprecedented. It's never happened before. But it was really hard to do that. And we had to take the really big footprint of the film and center footprint. We built the first 25 years of Amazon and doubled it in 24 months. We built out that transportation network in just a couple of years. You know, we nearly doubled the size of our workforce during that time. And I think you saw it in other businesses. You know, AWS is a really big part of helping companies and governments have business continuity during the pandemic. And so many companies and organizations in the last year made the strategic decision that they were going to stop running their own infrastructure technology and disproportionately chose AWS to help them move to the cloud. And we've spent a lot of time helping them make that transformation. So what about investors? I mean, the stock is down significantly from a peak last year. Obviously, there's broader market turmoil. Yeah, I think, you know, for investors financially, I'd say it's mixed.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,961,2022-11-19 20:04:34
18348," Yeah, I think, you know, for investors or financially, I'd say it's mixed. You know, I think we have some businesses that are growing really strongly. If you look at AWS, you know, in 2021, grew 37 percent year-over-year, you know, it's not a $74 billion revenue run rate business. It's pretty unusual growth. And we grew 58 percent year-over-year in our advertising business, you know, it's a $32 billion revenue run rate business. So some businesses are growing really strongly. And, you know, we've continued to grow in our retail business despite pretty crazy comparable during 2020. But I think the real challenge for us there is on the cost side. And there have been several things that have happened, some of which are more controllable than others. You know, I think the part that's less controllable is really around inflation. And I think we thought that inflation would start to attenuate in 2022. And with the war in Ukraine, it just went the other way and has significantly accelerated. So the cost of trucking and line haul and ocean and air and fuel has just substantially gone up. And I think that will attenuate at some point. No one knows how long that will take. I think the more controllable areas for us are really around fulfillment center capacity and productivity. It was taking about 24 months to build new fulfillment centers during the pandemic. And so we had to make decisions, you know, in mid-2020 and early 2021 on how much demand we were going to plant for it. And so we end up with more capacity than we need right now. And there's a number of things that we're working on. We've stopped building on properties where we don't need it yet. And we've let a number of leases lapse. And not a small number, you know, of both those things. We've had a lot of occasions in our history where we've worked on productivity and made improvements. And we have a lot of clearly defined issues. And I'm confident we're going to get back to the right level of profitability. You are going to sub least 30 million square feet of space. Is there a mistake in the execution there because of the overbuilding? Again, because you have to make these decisions two years in advance. And again, if you put yourself back in 2020 where we were growing 39 percent year over year on a $245 billion revenue run rate, it's very hard to know what's the right amount to build. And you have to make a decision. And we made the decision to err on the side of our consumers and sellers. Now how would you grade Amazon's performance with employees, your colleagues? There has been some high profile. Yeah. I think that when I started in this gig, we had just created a new leadership principle to strive to be Earth's best employer. And I think we spent a lot of time trying to think through what that really means. It's broad. And I think we've made a fair bit of progress, but it's still early, in my opinion. But I still think there are many areas that we can keep improving. And I think the first one I'd mention is safety. I think that in our fulfillment centers, that is the top priority. And when you get into the details and numbers and outside of all the spin of it all, we're about average there, but we're not trying to be average. We want to be the best in the industry and the best in the world at it. That's a high priority and an area that I'm passionate about and the team is passionate about. And I think we have a lot of work we can do to make our employees everyday lives easier. We've identified kind of a top 100 list of areas that we can be better at, that we're just metronomically stepping through. And so we've made a lot of progress, but we've a lot of work to do still. Elon Musk just came out saying he has a super bad feeling about the economy, Tesla laying off 10% of his staff. Jamie Dimon says he's preparing for an economic hurricane. The World Bank just slashed its forecast for global growth. How do you feel about the economic climate? Well, I wasn't planning on giving any guidance to the camera. Please. But, super bad or super bad? I think there are some things that are related to Amazon that are useful to remember. I think the first piece is remember that 85% of the worldwide retail market segment share is offline. And if you believe that that equation is going to flip at some point, which we do, I think it will flip over a long period of time. If you look at different downturns, should we have one at some point? We've been through a few, obviously, in the 25 years that I've been at Amazon, customers change their habits. And so I also think there's...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,962,2022-11-19 20:09:01
18349," Did we have one at some point? And we've been through a few, obviously, in the 25 years that I've been at Amazon, customers change their habits. And so I also think there's, you know, those two reasons, those two factors give me some optimism that even if we have a downturn that we have the potential to still grow. We have a roadmap that's, you know, to probably three to five years long, and we're gonna continue to invent, we're gonna continue to be insurgent, and we have a lot of work to do to get to where we think we ultimately can get for customers. Now, when it comes to the stock, as I mentioned, it has fallen significantly. Do you think investors are missing something or has tech just been overvalued? And this also, of course, matters to employees who are significantly paid in stock? Well, you know, I look, I haven't been at Amazon for 25 years. I arrived at the company three weeks before we went public. I have never tried to predict what the stock's gonna do. And anytime I've tried to a little bit, I've been wrong. So, you know, I think it's a pretty hard to predict what's gonna be in any short period of time. I do really believe that Benjamin Graham maximum that in the short term, the stock market tends to be a voting machine and the long term it tends to be a waiting machine. And I think if you, you know, we've been through a lot of points in 25 years of Amazon where the macro factors are off and stocks are down, our stock is down. But you can't really control that. You know, we have a concept we talk about a lot at Amazon inputs and outputs. You know, in the ultimate output for a company is share price, you know, and then other big outputs are free cash flow or profit or revenue. You can't really manage the outputs. You have to manage at the input level and that's where we spend all our time. And so if you do the right things for the business long term, things tend to work out. I think we've had very good returns for investors and I expect that to be true again. Do you see Amazon strategy as fundamentally different from Netflix and Disney and if so, how? You know, you want to write your resume for robots, not for humans. The only job your resume has is to be comprehensible to the software that is reading it because that software or robot is going to decide whether or not a human ever gets their eyes on it. These things are programmed by a certain segment of the population that might not be totally inclusive or not be fully aware. Concerns about how this technology could exacerbate discrimination. For the FTC, I think foremost, the FTC needs to be making sure that we're fully understanding this technology. We don't trust companies to self-regulate when it comes to pollution. We don't trust them to self-regulate when it comes to workplace comp. Why on earth would we trust them to self-regulate AI? What are the moon shots at Amazon that are capturing most of your time and attention? What is going to define the next era of Amazon? Is it Astro, the home row, butter? Is it something else? Well, you know, we have a unique way that we look at big things and we get big new investments. I'm not sure it's right or wrong. It just happens to be our way. We ask ourselves when we're considering something for questions. We ask, if it's successful, can it be big and move the needle in Amazon? Is it being well served today? Do we have a differentiated approach? Do we have confidence there? If not, can we acquire quickly? If we like the answer to those questions, we'll go pursue it with a single-threaded team that isn't distracted by the rest of the business. Sometimes that leads to innovation investments that seem...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,963,2022-11-19 20:13:18
18350," We like the answer to those questions. We'll go pursue it with a single threaded team that isn't distracted by the rest of the business. And sometimes that leads to innovation and investments that seem pretty obvious. Like, when I got to that company, it was a book's only retailer. And then we expanded to music and video and electronics and so it seems obvious to people. Other times that process does not lead to investments that seem obvious to people. I mean, AWS was something that people externally and internally thought was a little bit nutty at the time. But just imagine what Amazon would be today without AWS. And I think that you see the same thing here. You know, there are so many significant investments from making that I'm excited about. I'm going to have to constrain myself to a few. But I'm really excited about what we're doing in the prime video space. I think we're clearly on the right track there and building a significant business. That's interesting because Netflix also just announced some layoffs. The first subscriber loss in a decade, Disney cutting back on costs. Do you see Amazon strategy as fundamentally different from Netflix and Disney and if so, how? Well, we're very bullish on it. And remember, all the models are a little bit different. But for prime video, we have 200 million plus prime subscribers who get that entertainment for free by being part of prime. And so we have a little bit different pricing model than some of the others. But I'm incredibly encouraged by what we have coming. If you look, I mean, we launched this show Reacher earlier in the year. It was a huge hit. We had the New Maisel season. We just launched the new Boys season, which is a big boys fan. I am a big boys fan. Because Amazon bought. It's very good. Of course, we have one of the rings coming up in September and Thursday and football. So I'm very bullish about it. We also, you know, we're excited about what we've done with MGM. I think some of the assets there will go very well with the rest of what we're doing entertainment-wise. And so if you look at Warner Brothers' discovery and Paramount and stars and global, they're building really significant subscription businesses. So I'm very bullish about that business. I'm optimistic that we have a chance to build a significant grocery business, which is early stages for us. I am excited about Kuiper, which is our low-earth orbit, satellite that we're building. You've got to remember there are 300 to 400 million people in the world who have limited to no internet connectivity. I mean, just think about how different the world is when you don't have that type of connectivity. And so I think that's a really significant opportunity that has some AWS characteristics to it. I continue to be very optimistic about Alexa. You know, building the world's best personal assistant. We have 200 million endpoints already that are using Alexa. We're clearly onto something there. And then you know, our autonomous driving, ride hailing, service and zoos that we're building here in Bay Area. I just think with the way auto consumption is evolving, I think that also is a chance to be a really significant business. Now, I don't know if all of them are going to be successful, but if any one of them becomes the fourth pillar for us on top of marketplace and prime and AWS, we're a completely different company. Just like we were when AWS became successful. So I think they're very worthwhile investments and bets that I'm optimistic about. You didn't mention Astro, obviously, though, power and buy. Alexa, but I mean, our home robot's going to be doing where I don't yet. Where is it? It's not really widely available for sale. What's the status? Oh, I hope you get one. OK. Thank you. Everyone's very curious about Jeff's role these days. What kind of executive chair he really is. He said when he left that he'd focus his attention and energies on initiatives that he really cares about as Ed Amazon, but from the outside, it looks like he's really focusing on philanthropy. He's focusing on space. What kind of an executive chairmen is he? Well, Jeff is always going to be involved. And I feel very lucky to have been in Amazon for 25 years. I feel very lucky to have worked directly for Jeff for 20 of them. And we have a really close relationship and have for a long time. And I think we share a lot of the same values about customers and how important it is to optimize for customers and how high standards they need to be given how easy it is for people to switch and the importance of invention and speed. And so I just feel very lucky to have had the chance to work so closely with them. Shops.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,964,2022-11-19 20:17:47
18351," You know, given how easy it is for people to switch and the importance of invention and speed. And so, you know, I just feel very lucky to have had the chance to work so closely with him. So is your relationship, I mean, he was your only boss for 25 years, right? Is your relationship fundamentally different than it was when you were the head of... Yeah, of course. Every single job you have, the relationships different. You know, remember, the first couple of years I worked for Jeff, I worked as what we call the shadow then, which is really like a teeth of staff. And that was different than when I was starting AWS, which was different from when we got AWS going. And it was, you know, a business that was starting to do well. And it's different when I'm in the CEO role. But, you know, the constant has always been that we have a great relationship and we collaborate really well. Amazon has poised to become the biggest private sector employer in the world. Second, only right now Walmart is in that spot. But Amazon will probably soon surpass it. First vote to unionize at Amazon warehouse. I know you've been spending a lot of time at warehouses. When you look at someone like Chris Smalls, who I think some people look at as this modern day hero who got fired, pulled off this union vote, what's your message to someone like him? Your message to the folks who think maybe we should join a union? Well, I know, I think that the first thing to be clear about is that employees get to make that choice, whether they want to have a union or not. They always have had that choice and it continues to be their choice. And, you know, we happen to think they're better off without a union for a number of reasons, including the fact that, you know, it's much harder when you have a union to have a direct relationship with your manager and to get things done quickly. So if you see something on the line that you think could be better for your team or you or your customers, you can't just go to your manager and say, let's change this. You know, there's a whole process in bureaucracy that you have to go through to be able to do that. You know, and we get, you know, when there's a union, we're going to get the feedback filtered by what the union decides is worth bringing up and we'd much rather hear from every employee whatever is on their mind. And so, you know, I think if you want to continue to have the structure that we've had for all this time, you have to have really competitive benefits. And then I think if you look at Amazon's, they're very unusual in this space. We championed the $15 minimum wage several years ago. The starting salary is now over $18 an hour, which is more than double the federal minimum wage. You get full health insurance and 401K and up to 20 weeks of parental leave. And if you want to get a college education, you haven't had one. We have a career choice program that lets our fulfillment center associate be able to do so. That is a very unusual and compelling set of benefits. And those were all accomplished without a union. So, you know, I think that we realize that we, you know, we have to continue to work on the relationship with our employees and we need to continue to provide the right benefits. And, you know, we need to continue to work on safety. And that's our intention. You made a huge mark on Amazon with AWS, obviously. What is the mark that you want to make? Still.

The FTC has revamped its antitrust inquiry into Amazon and by some accounts is accelerating it. Are you preparing for an antitrust lawsuit from the FTC? If you are a large company that's growing to a significant extent like we have, you have to be prepared to be scrutinized and we have known this for some time you know many years and we have tried to run the company with that in mind and knowing that if if somebody looked that we would stand up to that scrutiny and I you know I think that's what we've tried to do in running the business. We can't control what you know whether organizations spring different suits against us but I think if you look at our business if you actually look at the fact if you take out of you know take out of the equation that there there may not be the most objective you know leadership when it comes to Amazon in that organization if you look at the facts you know in our retail business we're about 1% of the worldwide retail market segment share and remember 85% of is still offline and if you look in our AWS business we know about depending on you measure it 95% of the worldwide global IT spend is on premises you know and then we have a cloud business and then we have a portion of that you know we're leading market segment share in the cloud part of this but we operate you know who we compete with AWS is really on premises IT in addition to the cloud so you know these are relatively small percentages of the entire pie and you can kind of step through all the businesses and I think simply because you've been successful in a few different businesses doesn't somehow mean that you have a natural market power it just means you've been successful in a couple different customer experiences but we still have a relatively small amount of market segment share on those areas. What about the SEC or being sued by them over third party data and how you've used it do you think in the past Amazon main mistakes with letting employees internally see how those third party sellers were doing? We have pretty good control I mean we of course disagree with the premise of that but I would say that we have very good controls with respect to the data that the different employees sets are able to see and by the way I think that we can be better for sellers you know I think that you know we can have better tools from the get started we get better tools from the manage what they're doing across their different Amazon units I think we can communicate better there's a whole bunch of things we can do better and we agonize over every single email or communication we get from sellers and we do very regularly robust surveying and a lot more sellers are happy with Amazon than unhappy with Amazon and I think if you look at what what they're able to do is you know as a business by virtue of selling on Amazon versus not it completely changes what's possible sellers don't really long for e-commerce software that exists in lots of places and it's not very expensive what they love about selling on Amazon is that they get access to our hundreds of millions of customers and that completely changes what their prospects can be in terms of the businesses they're building so we have a lot of work to do there like we do in a lot of other places but I think we have a very strong partnership with sellers what's the view of the supply chain right now and how much pain there is going to continue to be and for how long well you know I think that there's a lot of challenges in the supply chain still I mean it's gotten better than it was but there are all sorts of challenges you know non-parasurable goods electronics chips is still really you know a significant issue for all sorts of businesses we have worked really hard to open a lot more points of presence and ports and increase our capacity and getting products in but I think it's going to be something that companies battle with for some time you made a huge mark on Amazon with AWS obviously what is the mark that you want to make still on Amazon I mean",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,966,2022-11-19 20:26:19
18353," with for some time. You made a huge mark on Amazon with AWS obviously. What is the mark that you want to make still on Amazon? I mean, in this new role, what's going to define the Andy Jassy era? Well, I don't really think of it that way, Emily. I mean, I don't think it's really about any Andy Jassy era or any one person. And by the way, AWS was not about any one person. If you spend a time on AWS, that is an unbelievable team, not just an incredible leadership team, which it is, but just top to bottom. The number of inventors and people care about customers and operate something where it has to work almost like a dial tone. It's always teams. And so I look at every single one of our businesses and take our retail business or our consumer business, which is the oldest for our businesses, 85% of it still lives offline. I think we have a lot of upside and a lot of growth. And I think as much invention as we've seen the last 25 years, the time I've been there, I think it's going to look small compared to the next 25 years. There is a lot for us to invent on behalf of customers. And so I'm excited to be part of the team that makes that happen. We are continuing to increase the amount that we give back to the communities in which we have big presence. And that really matters to me. I think we have a responsibility to do that. And so it's a long journey that we're working on. But I'm excited to be part of it and I hope to talk for a long time.

I'm François Lacqua here at the Plaza Hotel in New York City. This event powered by Bloomberg featured finalists selected by the Earthshot Council, launched by Prince William. A shot is a global initiative that drives innovation on solutions to climate change and environmental issues in the following categories. Protect and restore nature. Clean our air, revive our oceans, build our waste-free world, fix our climate. So over the next half an hour, we'll bring you all the highlights for this most important gathering. This is Bloomberg. Protecting the environment was of course close to my grandmother's heart. And I know you should have been delighted to hear about this event and the support you're all giving our Earthshot finalists. The next generation of environmental pioneers. Together in this room are the people and organizations who will help us to achieve the Earthshot mission to repair, restore, and rejuvenate our planet within this current decade. That mission is not simple. Just as President John F. Kennedy so famously said, as he challenged the United States for America, to unite behind the goal of putting man on the moon, we choose to do these things not because they are easy but because they are hard. I know that the world is an uncertain place right now that many families and communities across the globe are facing unimaginable challenges, from conflicts to energy crisis and food shortages. While addressing these in the short term, we must also remain resolutely focused on tackling the greatest challenges that threaten our tomorrow. Because if we don't, the changing climate will only serve to entrench these immediate challenges into fundamental global issues, severely impacting the lives of each and every one of us. That is why our collective mission is so urgent. But there is huge reason to be optimistic. The 2021 cohort of Earthshot winners and finalists is evidence that we can succeed. That we can protect our world for our children, our grandchildren, and the generations that will follow them. These pioneers exemplify the leadership needed in this decade of change. They include inspiring activists, brilliant innovators, a forward-thinking city, and even an entire country making a real difference. But they cannot do it alone. This must be a team effort. We must come together behind their innovative solutions to ensure they reach their full potential with pace and scale. While my message today is one of gratitude and encouragement, I also acknowledge that you cannot succeed in isolation. As governments, we have a responsibility to create the incentives and the space for you to flourish. A receptive environment for change and the accountability that comes with guardianship. In many nations, the foundation for this approach has been flayed for us long ago if we choose to listen. Where I come from, I'll tear our New Zealand a beautiful place, you must visit.

18355," It's connected. Our people, our plants, our animals, descendants of Ranganui, the sky father and Papa Tuanuku, the earth mother and their children. And so it follows that people and nature are kin, are family. And we must care for one another in the spirit of Kaitiaki Tanga, which translates into guardianship by the people of the land for the next generation. In short, kō ahō te tāau, kō te tāau kō ahō, I am the environment and the environment is me. Our life source, our economy, our future. Now I've seen this in action first hand many times, not least in my own backyard, the Pacific, where the ocean is a source of protein, income, culture and connection. Now that it is a source of challenge, as it rises up and begins to inundate small island nations. It can be confronting to hear and see the stories of just how real these challenges are, but none of us are here because we have given up, but because we believe there is a way to change the future. We are not only part of the nature, but we are nature. Nature is living element. For indigenous people, nature is whole. Our planet is alive. The rivers are her blood. The trees are her hair. The soil, her skin, the wind, her breeze. And indigenous peoples, our planet they know, they are the doctor. We are protecting 80% of the world's biodiversity. Because our way of life do not harm nature at the opposite. We are strengthening ecosystems. We improve biodiversity by cooperating with the birds and trees, listening to the winds, observing the cloud, learning from even the little insect. We protect nature by setting up our own limits. We don't take more that mother earth can give and we give back. We protect the sacred trees. We don't destroy the field of the medicinal plants. We choose, precinctly, the animal that we can kill to just keep the balance of the ecosystem. As all of us know in this fight, no one can afford to sit on the sidelines. No one can claim that climate change is somebody else's problem or to forget of for future generations to address. We are all affected by a warming planet. We see that every day. And decisions being made right now will determine our shared tomorrow. So we must choose and we must act as united nations ourselves. Our progress depends on collective action, on collective ingenuity. If we stick together, we can make fixing the climate the greatest project and greatest achievement of our lifetimes. We have the science, we have the solutions. Now all the world needs is political will. Together we can create a future where rampant carbon is removed from the atmosphere, where green buildings and green business transform the livability of communities, where easy access to renewable energy enables greater equity, where sustainable agriculture feeds a growing global population. The needs are urgent and the costs of inaction are worse than any nightmare. But let us not be driven by, let us be driven by hope not fear, by optimism not despair. Because hope is not passive. Hope is the ultimate source of renewable energy pushing us forward every day to try and try again.

We will continue to drive impact around system changing climate solutions and amplify the earth shop prizes call to accelerate progress to repair our planet through collaboration and innovation. But most importantly, we will remind ourselves what can be achieved when we turn pessimism to optimism and optimism into action. Coming up, more from the panelists and finalists here at the earth shop prize innovation side. This is Bloomberg. While Teslas and the like make for good headlines, the reality is that even if every car on the roads today won electric, it wouldn't be enough to curb global emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change. greenhouse gas emissions from transportation account for about 29% of total US greenhouse gas emissions. So what about the other 71%? Building to crowds America burned fossil fuels to operate. What we want to do is make that all electric. Instead of burning oil and gas to give us the energy and electricity we need, we want to do 100% clean energy, all electric. We want to turn buildings into Teslas. Just like a Tesla or an electric vehicle is all electric with no fossil fuels, we want to do that with our buildings. And if we can do it in one building, we can do it in all buildings. And if we do it in all buildings, we'll reduce 30% of US greenhouse gas emissions. Markets come down in Europe from the financial centers of the world. Bloomberg markets European closed with Guy Johnson and London and Alex Diel and New York. Real time numbers, real time analysis. Welcome back to the best of the earth shot prize innovation summit. The guests featured ranged from heads of state to leaders of grassroots environmental organizations. Well, amongst them was philanthropist and Microsoft founder Bill Gates. Yeah, it's too bad you can't do things overnight in either mitigation or adaptation. And you know, when I last went through Europe, people were the leaders were all saying, hey, give me technologies so I can tell Putin to get lost. And I said, hey, in five years, you're going to be able to call him up. And they were like, no, we'd like it. No, it's the year now. Okay, that, how's your planning permission regime and all the, you know, planning for that future grid? Seeds typically between the time you start and they get out in the farmers fields is about eight years. Now, we have a pipeline of innovations. You know, we've been funding the CG system for 20 years now. It's funded about a billion year. It's if people care at all about adaptation, that thing will be funded at two billion a year. I mean, there won't be anything close to the impact of climate related seeds, climate related maze, rice, wheat, sort of a millet. And thank goodness because of human genetics, we know how to do the editing, thank goodness, because of AI, we know how to find the alleles, because of drones, we can measure stuff in the field. So there's huge advance in terms of how the whole seed ecosystem moves at, at full speed. The timing is very tricky here.

18357," system moves at full speed. The timing is very tricky here. The warming doesn't stop the day you get to zero emissions. There's a lag in this system. It's about a 20-year lag. So you haven't seen that Earth Tempter's not equilibrated to the atmospheric CO2 content. So when you get to zero, it's not like 2051. Take my air conditioner away. No, it starts quite a bit later. And so you have to look at what the peak is. And you can't just plan for OK, 2030, 2030 is where your main production in central Africa is down 25%. By 2050, it's down 70%. And you will have switched in most of those areas from a fairly heat sensitive crop to Sorghum. Now Sorghum productivity is super low. So we'll get people to do better maize for these next 15 years. And then they are going to have to switch to Sorghum. It is tough when you see the floods in Pakistan. I mean, nobody expected that. If the goal of climate was to make us pay attention, wow, that is way beyond expectation. So some adaptation money literally will just be disaffirmative recovery money. The boundary of what is also pretty confusing. I mean, what is food aid? If climate's causing some food production losses, all world-proof program money is that all climate adaptation money? It's certainly the need for it's going up. That's a system that's about 6.5 billion a year, so relative to the systemic solution, which is the research piece, it's relatively larger. But the demand for that piece, which is the acute half of Pakistani rice, got flushed away. And so you're going to have malnutrition problems if you don't go in for that. That's also a type of adaptation. And so I do think we're going to bring some rigor to this because the pressure now, the goal of doubling the adaptation money from, they say, 20 billion here to 40 billion here, the pressure on that is the problem. Still peanuts. No, it's very small. I mean, literally, yeah, if you start sticking food aid in there, you can use it up very quickly, rebuilding after hurricanes. I mean, we had hurricanes before, but the costs there are absolutely gigantic. There are ways of stopping wildfires, there are ways of dealing with sea level rise. So the innovation agenda, not just on seeds, the innovation agenda is going full speed on mitigation. That's where there's 100 companies break through energy's funded. So by mitigation, you mean mostly energy, you mean everything to do with energy, you mean generation of energy, you mean batteries, you mean transport, you mean all of the new and there's some renewables that are already traditional, but more that need to come on. So that's the package that you're talking about mitigation. Or are you also talking about agriculture as mitigation? Yeah, so every area of emissions, the world tends to focus on past near cars and electricity. That's not a third of emissions. And so the focus on the easiest third, now 4% of new cars are electric. So that's the field that we're furthest along. About 4% of energy generation is wind and solar. And as you triple the size of your grid, you want that to be say, some people would say 100%. Other people might say 70 to 80%. The amount you have to build, we're not within a factor of 5 of the build rate of those. But those are the easy sectors. Cement, clean cement costs over twice as much as the way we make cement today. It's not, it's partly the heating energy, it's partly the basic thing, remembering chemistry. When you take calcium carbonate and heat it, you get calcium, that's what makes cement. But the thing that goes away, that's CO2. And so we have to have a way of making cement.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,971,2022-11-19 20:48:03
18358," carbonate heated, you get calcium, that's what makes cement. But the thing that goes away, that's CO2. And so we have to have a way of making cement, which a number of these innovative. And a steel and iron. Yep. There's a whole family of hard to obeyed sectors. That's true. If you get a dead industrial sector, if you get green hydrogen that's cheap enough, it actually solves quite a large number of those. Some of the industrial processes should go straight to electricity. And some you go through, you do your reduction using the hydrogen, where you would have used some hydrocarbon concept before. For steel, we actually have companies doing both. We have electrosyl and others doing electricity as the way of replacing the blast furnace. And then we have others that take hydrogen. And if you get the hydrogen cheap enough, you get the super magic thing, which is that the green product doesn't cost more. That's called green premium equals zero. And then your adoption scale is utterly different. If we tried to subsidize steel and cement, say rich countries say, OK, we want to get rid of that, which goes to our 15% of emissions, that's greater than all foreign aid budgets put together. And so over 200 billion foreign aid never will pass that number. It's just not politically possible. It's a number that's at about 170 and going down today. Coming up, more from the panelists and finalists here at the Earth's Shop Prize Innovation side. This is Blue Bright. So what's the best investment advice you've ever been given by anybody? The compound interest, the compounding of returns is an incredible miracle of business, finance, and human existence. Everything you learn is additive every day. And if you keep at it and don't quit, it's an incredible miracle. And it's not just interest. It was always said above compound interest returns, compound business returns, compound human returns. They're all very additive because you learn every day. And if you keep at it, it's very, very helpful. In your observation of investors, what do you think is the biggest mistake that average investors make selling it the wrong time? And they sell when the prices go down? Yes. Or yes. Not keeping. But people have conviction, or if they invest for the right reasons, just keep at it. You've got to explain this one to me. What does it mean when the White House says, we're watching markets carefully? It means they have a Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. They have been an insane it. Lots of Bloombergs. Lots of Bloombergs. Lots of Bloombergs. Lots of Bloombergs. Lots of Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. What does it mean? What does it mean? What does it mean? What does it mean? It means they have a Bloomberg. Welcome back to the Earth Shop Prize Innovation Summit. Finalists of the annual award appeared alongside special guests, including World Wide Business leaders, philanthropists, and non-governmental activists. Now while the 2022 finalists have been announced, our panelists have their eyes on the future, and here's what they have to say. This is the Earth Shop Decade. We are in a race to repair and regenerate the planet. Some will focus on policy. Some will focus on activism. We are focused on supporting the game changes, the innovators, the entrepreneurs, and the problem solvers. We believe in the power of human ingenuity, grit, and determination to create solutions that if scaled, could repair the planet. We have only 8% of the ocean protected today. And our Earth Shop is, as Paris said, 30.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,972,2022-11-19 20:52:17
18359," could repair the planet. We have only 8% of the ocean protected today. And our earth shot is, as Pati said, 30 by 30. 30% of the ocean at least, 30% of the ocean protected by 2030. And we know that if we protect the right 30%, not only we will prevent the extinction of many marine species, but also we will produce more fish. There's going to be these protected areas are going to produce a spillover that will exceed the forgon catch. So we're going to have more fish to eat, food security, livelihoods for people. And we know that for every dollar that we invest in a protected area in a marine reserve, that produces 10 dollars in economic output and create more jobs. So it's a triple win for marine life, for food security and for climate and of course for the economy. So that's the goal, the mission, to in the next 8 years. And that's where the earth shot is really, it's pretty crazy. In the next 8 years, we need to quadruple all the ocean protection that has ever happened in human history. Are you optimistic that I can be done? I am optimistic, there's no choice. I've seen firsthand the potential that a breakthrough idea can hold. And if we start seeing more of these transformative solutions across all the challenges facing our planet and suddenly our earth shot won't seem so improbable. The work will be difficult, it'll take extraordinary resources, determination, partnership. But we've got all the essentials right here in this room. So what is the challenge? It's the speed, scale, and cost of making these green hydrogen generators. Well that's exactly what we are working on. Because to make green hydrogen the fuel source of the future, it needs to be cheaper than fossil fuels. And that means, electrolyzers are going to need to be really, really cheap. If you want to take a solution around the globe as quickly as possible, you need to make it standardized, mass-produced commodity. A product that is easy to make and quick to build and cheap as well. And so while some believe electrolyzers need to be large machines, we believe the electrolyzer should be a standardized, mass-producible product that can make green hydrogen anywhere for anyone. In 2030 we imagine millions and millions of projects on restore. And not just places on earth where we see nature being brought back, but all of the other nodes that are key to ensuring success. So the technology providers, the nurseries, the seed banks, the funders, the government incentive programs, so that we have an ecosystem that really allows us to leverage the many, many connections within the nature-based solution space. And in 2030 we have been focused on another key area which is cities and cities require data and insights to take action on climate and to preserve nature, to create more nature and tree canopy. So we've set a goal that we want to- We need more nature in cities, exactly. Exactly, right. And we've been partnering with cities like Los Angeles to give them insights utilizing AI and geo mapping on where all the places that you can create more tree canopy which reduces urban heat islands improves air quality sequesters carbon. So we want to bring data and solutions to bringing nature into cities as well as of course preserving and restoring nature. And so one of the goals that we've set is we want to enable over 500 cities around the world, I know we're going to hear from the mayor of a Paris after this, to reduce a gigaton of carbon emissions by 2030. And so that's through data, tools, insights, whether that's evolving transportation systems or planting new tree canopy. So that's a big bold target that we want to see achieved by 2030. Anyway, I guess I'm in the wrong place. I came here to invite all of you to the Grouch Convention, but it turns out you're all about my least favorite thing. Helping. Oh. You've got me, Oscar. I do like helping people learn how to reuse repurpose and recycle together everyone in this room can build a world where nothing.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,973,2022-11-19 20:56:41
18360," Recycle. Together everyone in this room can build a world where nothing goes to waste. And that includes even you. Me? Uh, sorry, Mike. I gotta get going to that convention, but uh, just between us. Yes. I do have a recycling bin right next to my can. But no, let that get out okay. It'll ruin my image. But my father believed in the power of the idea. And over time, the vision, the purpose, the courage, it embodied, has inspired each generation to take on its own challenges. Not because they're easy, but because they're hard. President Kennedy understood that the effort to land on the moon would bring out the best in us, that everyone would have to contribute, that it would require innovation, creativity, teamwork, commitment, and faith. And that world would be better because of it. The earth shot prize has inspired the same spirit of optimism and ingenuity on a global scale to tackle the most pressing challenge we now face repairing the planet. My family and I are so excited that the Prince of Wales will honor this year's earth shot prize winners in partnership with the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston. A city that is committed to scientific excellence, environmental justice, and the fight against climate change. We're proud that President Kennedy's moonshot legacy still inspires hope, and we look forward to welcoming all of you who are working to ensure a better future here on Earth. And that's all from the earth shot prize innovation summit. You can find complete coverage of the event, including full interviews and articles on bloomberg.com. I'm Francing Lackwap from New York, and this is Bloomberg. So is there more pressure when you're trying to win a basketball championship than when you're trying to please investors? Where's the greater pressure? I think it's definitely trying to win a championship. It's hard because when you invest and you know this, when you're investing, you can control a lot more things. When in a basketball court, you can't control whether somebody's going to make a shot, you've got to get lucky. And what's the greater pleasure of making five times your money on a Distress Dead investment or winning the NBA championship? They're both fabulous. I wish I could do one each year. That would be great. I think there's a great feeling in being right on an investment that you've done a tremendous amount of work and you've made money for your clients, which I think is great. I think winning a championship is, it's a very surreal feeling because there's a whole city or state that is actually behind you. You know, we had 70,000 people at the finals and we had them all outside. It had 17,000 in stands and then literally like 60,000 people outside. And when we won, like just the joy that you had brought to the city was phenomenal. Bloomberg has enhanced search on the terminal to deliver what you need when you need it.

Can it sustain its normal at a time when everybody else is facing a very different reality? Bloomberg surveillance. Be informed. Be prepared. Be ahead of the game. My guest this week has been described as one of the greatest English soccer strikers of all time. As a player, Gary Linnaker scored 48 goals for England and nearly 250 for English clubs. Since leaving the pitch, he's become the face of football coverage here in the UK and is a big vocal presence on social media. When I sat down with him ahead of the World Cup, I wanted to ask him about concerns to do with Qatar's human rights record, the likes of David Beckham doing deals with the state and why footballers can never win. Gary, thank you so much for being here. Pleasure. Lovely to have you. Thank you. And it's an interesting time to talk to you because normally before a World Cup, there be a lot of the usual feelings, excitement, trepidation. This feels quite different because of the controversy around where it is. Believe you me, this is the same before every World Cup. There are different levels of it and this is high level, but you can go back. You go back to 1934 if you want. When the World Cup was in Italy, it was used as a vehicle to promote fascism for Mussolini. So this is not new. In 2014, we were all, there were rights on the streets by people in Brazil saying they shouldn't spend all this money on the stadiums, they should spend it on social care. We had Russia who invaded Crimea just a few years before they hosted the World Cup. So it's not something we're in accustomed to. Do you think it's on a different scale though because some of the reports, of course, about the number of lives that have been lost in the building of the stadium and the preparations? I think what makes this different is not just in terms of human rights and obviously workers' rights and what happened to them and lots of lives were lost in the building of the stadium. I think what is really different about this one is that we know when the bid was proved to be successful that it was corrupt. So I think that's what perhaps separates this from the rest. When rights wise, well, there's a few countries that have hosted it that would fail some tests on that. Well, let's go to that in a minute, but on the FIFA point, because the former FIFA president Sep Blatter has now said it was a mistake. He's waited a long time to do that as well. I mean, not in the clear as that. I couldn't tell him that the minute he opened the thing and it said Qatar on it. Do you think there's any value in that statement at this point or is it just pointless to hear it? I just don't understand why I would do that now. I don't know whether that helps or hinders or what. I mean, he's the ex president of FIFA at a time where there was a lot of dodgy goings on. So yes, it was a mistake. It was more than a mistake, wasn't it, really? Well, I mean, also FIFA just having put out this email. Let's not focus on the politics. Let's focus on the football. Do you think FIFA has learned as a body about what's the important focus? I do believe that the current, I should say, maybe I'm being naive, but I do believe the current people in charge of FIFA. And it includes awesome vendors in a really high role. I have certain amount of faith and trust that awesome vendors are decent, upstanding, non-corrupt person. So I don't think there are levels of corruption if there are any. There will be in certain branches of FIFA because it goes, it's global. But in terms of the very top, I think it's much more transparent. The voting system is much more transparent and there's less corruption. Do they still make mistakes? Yes they do, in terms of things that they said. And the thing you just mentioned was very tone death to say that. There's no question that this is kind of sports washing.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,975,2022-11-19 21:05:27
18362," into the view, the reason for the view. And if you were gay as a fat, would you go to this tournament? It's a great question. I don't know because it's a hypothetical question. I would, you would have to give it a lot of thought, I think. You know, I saw one of their main representatives, I think it's Al Tarni speaking in an interview saying that, you know, people gay people will be welcome if the question was asked, what about if they walked down the street holding hands? He said that will be absolutely fine. But let's see. But there's a risk. But I understand why people, if the LGBTQ, etc, would have reservations and thoughts and concerns. Absolutely. Whether I, you could say, whether I would go if I were gay, I honestly don't know. I don't know. I mean, you are going to work to... I'm going to work. Yeah. How are you feeling about that with this number? I'm fine, but I don't have the slightest problem about going to work. I'm not going there to support the World Cup being in Qatar. I'm going there to report. Yeah, to cover the numbers. For me, that's my job as a kind of sports broadcaster journalist. Yeah. As, you know, journalists will be sent to the war with Russia and Ukraine, but it doesn't mean say they support what we're going on. No, no, no, no, I just mean that. But I've meant more like if there was any nervousness, you know, just things like Qatar as UK ambassador has warned against public displays of affection. I'm not saying are we doing any affection with you? I'm not saying we're fine, thing. I'm not saying that. Happy single man, I understand. But also for the fans, I wonder if you've got a nervousness about that, not just on the human rights side, but the zero tolerance for drinking in public and being drunk. I know. Well, I always have concerns about English fans traveling abroad, because I'm afraid a small percentage of them do go there looking for trouble, looking to just get drunk, looking for a fight. And that's been part of something that has been detestable around the English world for years, and they ruin it for everyone else. What will happen to them in Qatar? I don't know if they go along that thing. But I think we've all got... I think all football fans, obviously, in their ranks, have the drinking side of things. Yeah, of course. Well, it's an nervousness, perhaps, around the whole thing as well. I'm sure. I mean, I think we'll all be thinking ourselves, how do we get a drink at some point? There might be that as well. Many footballers, as you've self-become pundits, ambassadors, journalists, commentators, there has also been criticism of, for instance, David Beckett, becoming a paid ambassador to Qatar ahead of the World Cup. He's got to promote tourism and culture and Qatar has become a face of it. What do you make of that sort of decision? Well, that's, again, it's a personal decision. I'm not going to say it would be judgmental. Would I do it? No. How it comes and I, obviously, played with him, has spoken out and urged him to think differently. Yeah. And I understand why he's done that. And, as I said, would I have done it? No. He's decided to go down that route. I would say about David. He's never really voiced his concerns about where the World Cup is, about... So, you know, it's not something he's ever got involved in. So, can you coos in a bit? He's not hypocritical. If I'd have done it, I'd have... I was very, very anti-the-bid when it was first revealed in 2010. I was in the room. I couldn't believe it. It seemed to me that it must have been corrupt because they were talking about staging a summer World Cup in Qatar where temperatures are in the forties, sometimes even approaching 50 degrees centigrade. It seemed unfathomable. So, it did... Then, obviously, laterally, it was moved to winter. And I was very vocal against it. So, if I was going to do something like that, I'd feel hypocritical. I don't think you could accuse Beckham of that. You might accuse him of doing something that you might feel is fundamentally a wrong thing to do. And a lot of people will think that. Are you disappointed by him doing that, though? Because he's a role model. For a lot of peers, a role model. As I said, I wouldn't do it. I think also people think, why does he need 10 million quid? Does he really need to do that? That's the other question. I don't know. I don't know. I have no idea how much he's getting paid, but I suspect he would survive without it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,977,2022-11-19 21:14:47

I suppose it's that, you know, the feeling of influence and how people have influence and what they do. Of course, footballers have become, obviously, sports a massive thing in the whole world anyway, football particular and just before a World Cup, it is and there's a lot of expectancy on footballers but there's a lot of criticism about how much they earn and stuff like that and footballers do get it in the neck. It's tough to win. Obviously they have a wonderfully lucrative life but it's funny. I always think they don't really get the criticism in other people with, in other sports even, you know, you go earn lots of money like gold for Formula One or you could even go in other routes like actors, huge actors get earned fortunes, musicians, brilliant musicians, they are, if you're in the entertainment industry you do get paid a lot of money but no one else gets that football. It's almost as though it's, all these are working class lads. It's a little bit different. It might be subconsciously but I think there's an element of that there a bit above the station. Is it also because they can and do, especially because they're so young earning so much money, getting into a lot of trouble at times, like the junk. Well, not many of them do. Not many of them do. So yeah, what's the other thing as well? It's absolutely a perception thing. Footballers are a cross section of working class society really. They come up and it's hard. They have to work really hard. They live very well. Every now and again a football will misbehave.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,978,2022-11-19 21:18:27
18365," Footballers are a cross section of working class society really. They come up and it's hard, they have to work really hard. They live very well. Every now and again a football will misbehave one out of the thousands of them around them. But that becomes a huge story. All the incredible good that they do for the local communities, visiting kids in hospital, doing loads of good things, raising awareness of whether it be racism or during the COVID pandemic. That doesn't become the big story. But one player goes out and a drunk and not out and gets pictured with a girl or something. Then that becomes like a front page story. And it's a little bit unfair. And that doesn't really happen as much in other areas. It's a disproportionate reaction around them. I mean of course when Axe has behaved badly or things, it also gets captured. But it's interesting to hear you think it is disproportionate. We should also say that there have been some really high profile cases and allegations made against top-class footballers in relation to behaviour with women. On the surface it seems a change in the culture when you were playing around the game. I don't know if that's fair and what you think about that. I don't know. I still think, when I played, I doubt it's that much different now. You'd have... It's a lot more money I suppose. Well there is a lot. Not people not settling down. There is a lot more money. There would be a lot more dangers and outside interests. I honestly think that mostly though, the massive majority of footballers would be really good lads, well behaved, work really hard on what they do and live properly because you have to now because it's so competitive. I think it was exactly the same. In my day, you will still get the odd drunk, the odd sexist, the odd homophobic person, like a cross-section of working class society and the odd person that will commit a crime. So, but it's not right. It's very occasional limited. I'm not trying to defend the actions of the... I can hear that. I'm trying to get a context and perspective of the overall picture of footballers. I suppose though, the other thing that's undeniable is we still don't have an openly gay male footballer in the Premier League. What could change or how could that change do you think? To make that a space where it feels comfortable? I don't know. I mean, it's a game and it's... I mean, it is distressing. And we've seen it starting to see it in other sports, aren't we? But, you know, Tom Daly we've seen and... Well, in the women's game as well. In the women's game as well. And I just would love it if we had an environment where they just felt... It seems absurd that anyone should... Because also if you're just scared of disobeying who you are. But it's just... I think it's a scientific thing as well. I mean, I kind of... Probably naively said something in an interview recently. We got picked up by quite a few... Smart gay people, which I've kind of learnt from. I was saying I honestly think that if a footballer came out it would be hugely positive and others as follow. And they... And they, you know, I was kind of told, you know, don't just... You've no idea how difficult this situation is. So... I mean, it's delicate. And it's an h-true. It's kind of baffling because it's obvious there must be lots of Premier League footballers and footballers around the country that are gay and are having to live not their true... And not be their true selves. And I think that's really sad. Did you like looking back on your career? Do you think you played a log of side men who weren't their true selves in that way? Oh, I think so. I think so. I'm pretty sure. I don't know for a fact, but... I think so. And if you have young footballers who come to you, say that... I've had a couple. Both anonymous, actually. One was... One was very close to coming out. And we were... He was actually the secret gay footballer. And he was... I was talking to my direct message quite a lot. And I was going to be doing the interview when... But then he got cold feet at the last second. And I said, by totally respect that, I totally understand. And then I was reached out through my agency at another anonymous football that was thinking about it. So I don't know who they are, but...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,979,2022-11-19 21:22:46
18366," But I totally understand. And then I was reached out through my agency and another anonymous football that was thinking about it. So I don't know who they are, but they're out there. Of course they're out there. And I couldn't understand how incredibly difficult it must be for. Do you think it's the fans, mate? I don't know. I don't know. It's probably everything. You know, they're kind of coming up. Who knows that mate not told their family? They might be scared about that. They might be scared about telling their teammates in the dressing room. I don't, it must be quite incredibly difficult, tough. On your coming out with your political views, a different type of coming out, and saying more what you think about things, it actually did take you a long time, didn't it? It took social media. I mean, I've always had to, you know, I was had to, I had nowhere to share them. And I think, you know, when you speak out like that, there are people who don't like the reactions and have ended up then self-sensory. Do you ever have that fear, that anxiety, after you've sent the post to all of that? I have a policy with, I've got three rules in total. One is not to eat when I'm, I had a few drinks, which I stick to. The other is not to eat if I'm angry, but I don't really get angry. So, but, you know, when I'm too frustrated. And my other one is that whenever I do any kind of tweet, I'll read it back. And then if I have 1% doubt, I won't send it. It's gone. Although that one occasionally, when I think of something, I think actually that's quite funny. I'll take a chance. But generally, over my three rules. Would you pay for your authentic case? I wouldn't have paid 44 billion for Twitter. Well, slightly separate deals. Would you pay? Well, I never asked for it in the first place. No, no, but the whole idea of how they're going to change a model, pay, I don't know yet. I'm going to weigh it out. I'm not going to make any rash decision now. I mean, you know, this is not, this is not. But the truth is, actually, most, I mean, a lot of people are on Twitter to follow people that they find interesting, whether they're blue, mostly blue tick people, whether they're like a politician or actor, or a sports person, or a musician, or real comedians, and you follow them. And they're the blue tick ones. So actually, I think it's the blue tick people that entice more people onto the platform. So Elon Musk, I think, should be paying us $8 a month, everyone on there, rather than the other way around. Well, you can tweet him direct, because he replies, it seems, to absolutely very well. Does it? Oh, right. Especially if you've got a blue tick. I doubt it. Agree with me now. I dare you to tweet him. You mentioned, of course, the reaction to footballers, former footballers, like yourself, from politicians at times. And you brought up the pandemic as well. And here in the UK, the former health secretary, Matt Hancock, when asked about footballers' wages during the lockdown, during the pandemic, said, quote, everybody needs to play that part in this national effort. And that means, primarily, footballers, too. He talked about taking pay cuts. You'll remember, all is. He's now in Australia taking part in a reality TV show called, I'm a celebrity, get me asked for it. Been suspended as a conservative MP. Do you think he's playing his part as an MP? I think he should have stuck to telling footballers to stick to football. Yes. I mean, I did do what he wants, but he's still an acting politician, so it seems a bit strange to me to disappear into the jungle. But I think maybe, did you see that thing when I'm really soon back with World Cup and he shook everyone's hand and he kind of ignored Hancock in middle? Yes. Maybe that made him go. That was it. I'm quite a bloody jungler. It might also be the 400 grand that he's been doing. It might be that one of the 400 pounds reasons for him going. I don't know if he's getting that, but they do pay well apparently. They're apparently so, but I suppose it was what you were talking about earlier about, who stays in which lane and who polices who. Well, of course. And with politicians, I always find it depends, they'll do it when it suits them. Yes. And then, of course, there are those who feel very passionately that our politicians shouldn't be celebrities and shouldn't be reaching for that because they're public servants. And then there's very serious points about him going in a space when those who were bereaved during the pandemic and feel... Indeed. I can understand people's reservations about it. It's almost a bit of comedy in a way, isn't it? But there are obviously more serious issues that he was a large part of the early days with... There's so many deaths in COVID and some, you know, some would throw the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,980,2022-11-19 21:27:11
18367," He's a large part of the early days with so many deaths in Covid and some would throw the blame at the government in terms of the lack of protection, certainly in care homes and things like that. So I don't know. I'm not, I don't know whether I'll even watch it. So you're not intending to do any of those particular shows? Good Lord, no. If you ever see me in one of those, you'll know things have gone on. We know it's really bad. That's your equivalent of taking some of these other deals, perhaps. Yeah, I think so, I don't know. I'd be my worst night. Thank you so much for talking to me. And thank you so much for being with us until we meet again. Take care and goodbye. However you get your news, this is Bullock Daybreak with Lake Blueburg. Welcome to Daybreak Australia. This is Count on the Close. Welcome to Bloomberg Crypto. On TV, Radio and the Web. This is Bloomberg. I'm going to name a couple of of your babies. I don't know if I'm asking you to choose amongst your children, but you know, some of the most recognizable buildings by you, of course, the Millennium Bridge, London City Hall, the Reichstag, and the Great Court British Museum. What was your favorite project to do? The Reichstag does stand out because, first of all, it's an energy manifesto. So it transformed something that was dependent on fossil fuels that uses all the technology to produce something which is essentially carbon neutral and there's a public building. That's a statement. It's a symbol of a city. It's a symbol of a nation. It incorporates works of art. It's recycling and existing building, which, as I mentioned earlier, is the ultimate in sustainability. If you can get a new life to a building, it also creates public space at the roof level. It's the most visited parliament in the world, so it puts the public above the politicians who are answerable to them. And that, of course, was made possible by the politicians. So it's a demonstration of democracy in action. Imagine simply climbing a cable into space. The concept is known as the space elevator. Not only could it significantly change how we leave planet Earth, but it could also completely transform humanity's relationship with space. And they're a scientist who think we could have already built it. We have the material, we have the technology, we have the lasers, we have the climbers, we have all of it. If a private entity wants to build it or a government, they can build it. It'll change society. We have no clue how colonizing in the space, how really spreading on the space, really change our society over the next 50 to 200 years. It'll be completely different.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,981,2022-11-19 21:31:27
18368," I saw a shark tank trailer. Yeah, that's me fun. That's me fun. What was the most like, surprising thing about it? Um, how kind, Mr. Wonderful actually, a softie is, I guess he is, yeah, he's a really nice guy. Did it give you any flashbacks to your YC days and the panic days of early entrepreneurship? Yes and that they do about 45 minutes of shooting for 7 minutes of airing. Yeah. And so if the entrepreneur makes a mistake and there are a few of these, it's totally fine. I'm Tony, how is the product editor at Square? And the four of us came together about six months ago to work on software for small business owners. That's the application video Tony Shoe and his door dash co-founders submitted to get a ticket into YC prestigious startup accelerator back in 2013. Fast forward nearly 10 years later and door dash has gone from a struggling food delivery story to a public company that's the US leader in delivery. But the big question facing companies now is how to navigate a potentially prolonged economic downturn. Joining me on this edition of Bloomberg Studio 1.0, door dash to EO and co-founder Tony Shoe. Tony, it's so great to see you. Great to see you too Emily. In person. I know. You went public in the pandemic, we were talking remotely, but there's nothing quite like an in-person interview. So thank you for being here. It's great to be here. You basically grew up in a restaurant as I understand it. What was it like leaving China moving to Illinois and starting this new life? It was a classic immigrant story. In many ways I would say looking back almost a fairytale like Journey where my parents came to the US with $250 in the bank. We immigrated to Illinois, Champaign, or Banna. My dad got his degree at the University of Illinois. My mom put food on the table by working three jobs a day, one of which did happen to be in a Chinese restaurant where I moonlight it as a dishwasher. So I got to hang out with mom that way as a way of growing up and I did that. I milled lawns and that's really kind of how I saved up money to buy Nintendo games and do all the things that were the wonders of my childhood. What do you think you learned from that? You know mowing lawns early, washing dishes early? I think two things. You know, one looking backwards, it's just that you have to work to actually get things done. I didn't understand what it meant to live off of food stamps to buy groceries or free and reduced lunch, you know, every day inside school. But it was a very empowering feeling to buy my own Nintendo or earn my way to buy my first Apple computer. The second thing was really just the power of independent thinking. You know, my parents, because they were so busy, just trying to make a life for our family that I was largely left alone. So I grew up playing basketball, watching TV. That's how I learned English. I grew up moving around a lot as a kid. And as a result, I think that gave me a lot of time to realize that it's pretty important to think for yourself. So you studied engineering at Berkeley. You went to business school at Stanford. And you actually started out as an intern at Square. I did. I can't tell you how many people have said to me, Tony Shoe was my intern. That's where. Like, that's how long I've been doing this and how, you know, Dordash just kind of came out of nowhere. Yeah, I, you know, it was, it was actually a pretty stiff competition between finishing school. Jack Dorsey and Keith were were trying to convince me to leave Stanford and work at Square full time. It was a fun and busy period of my time, but I enjoyed both. So how did the idea for Dordash come about and the decision to not work for, you know, Jack Dorsey and Square, which I'm sure was also kind of intoxicating, right? The idea for Dordash really came from this, you know, lifelong interest in helping these physical business owners, really people like my mom. So we talked to hundreds of small business owners and it was surprising to us that even in 2013, delivery was not a solved problem. There were business owners who would show us literally booklets of delivery orders.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,982,2022-11-19 21:35:48
18369," Rising to us that even in 2013, delivery was not a solved problem. There were business owners who would show us literally booklets of delivery orders that they would refuse. I mean, we're talking about thousands of dollars per week, which is the difference sometimes between making payroll and actually surviving, and they would just turn them down because they were delivery orders, which to us was a really novel and unfortunate phenomenon. And frankly, a necessary one, and that really became the impetus to start DoorDash. You started out driving for competitors, right? I was driving for a lot of different services to try to actually understand logistics. You know, my background, as you mentioned, more in engineering math, I thought I was going to be a cancer researcher. I mean, that's pretty much what I spent all of my undergraduate days at Berkeley doing that kind of 180'd into world of business. And so I think it's really important to really learn things for yourself, to think from first principles. Kind of, again, back to that independent thinking. Mindset, I talked about as a child growing up. Did you try for Uber or Lyft? I even drove for services that were a little bit older. And services like FedEx or Domino's and really try to explore how does delivery work. And it was really trying to understand every component part. I mean, it sounds really simple, right? Bring you a burrito from point A to point B, but there were actually 20 steps involved in that delivery. It just didn't appear as obvious to the naked eye. So the first two years of Door to Ashes life, we did deliveries almost every single day. So where did you go from there? I mean, I mean, early days, I know Elon Musk has said starting a company is like swallowing glass and staring into the abyss of death. One of the first ones came actually as early as month three of the company's life. So we were maybe 11 weeks, 12 weeks old as a company. There was a big Stanford football game in September and long story short, we were late on every single order. And we had no ability to turn off the sights. So it was just horrendous. Everyone in the company, all 12 of us were delivering. And everyone, rightfully so, was furious because of how late we were. And so we had a decision to make. Do we do the right thing and refund every single customer, which would have cost us about 40% of our bank account, or do a less right thing and survive another day. Because it was very hard for us at that time to raise capital, which was something true for Door Ashes early history. And it took us about 30 seconds to click, submit, refund. And the lesson for us always is a founding team. And frankly, even today, as a company, we'd rather die chasing excellence than live to be mediocre. It wasn't so obvious either in the earlier years. I remember in 2016, you did a down-round. I think you actually came on the show around that time. How did you weather the doubters and the people who didn't believe? There were about a thousand days in the desert between 2016, 17, and 18. Sometimes with company building, so long as you can convince yourself, because time is your most precious resource, you should keep going. And if you can keep going long enough, you might get lucky enough to make it. So over time, how did you balance quality with the need and desire to scale? And then scale globally. In these types of businesses where it's low margin, high complexity, you really have to figure out what your unit of business is. For us, that was a city. So in order to, before going to 7,000 or 10,000 cities globally, we made one city work. And after city one worked, we made city two work. And after we started getting higher and higher confidence that we can make baskets of cities, we're irrespective of the geographies or what, you know, the customer situation look like or what the merchant makeup was, then we gained the confidence to actually roll out everywhere. Then came the pandemic. Brian Chesky has said the pandemic was like a torpedo for Airbnb. Was it like the opposite for DoorDash? It was like the biggest wave behind her back, which had the ability to break us. And it almost did because we grew two X in two weeks. We went from a singular US restaurant delivery business. That's what you and I would be talking about in 2019. To today, five businesses in 27 countries, much more than just restaurants. And so all of that was created in the last two years.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,983,2022-11-19 21:40:04
18370," In 27 countries, you know, much more than just restaurants. And so all of that was created in the last two years. The big question is how much do customers keep ordering out in a high inflation environment? What do you think of when you think of a battery? For most, it's what we use to power devices for both work and play, and maybe even your car. Over the past few decades, they've gotten way more powerful, long-lasting and affordable. But all of this is just a prologue to what the next batteries are going to do. As we drive to an increasingly renewable power driven grid, we also need to be able to store energy and release it later to cover those periods of weather intermittencies that are driving this new grid that we're in. It's a multi-trillion dollar opportunity, and it's imperative that we figure out the solution here. How we store energy on a massive scale is in many ways the central challenge of the fight to stop climate change. You will put a woman on Mars. You will bring forth global cooling. You will be the first chief crypto officer. Because when you subscribe to Bloomberg, you won't just get news. You'll get insight into limitless possibilities, knowledge, and inspiration to feed your ambition. So before you invent pioneer, disrupt, before you change the world, Bloomberg. DoorDash went public, middle of the pandemic, and I remember actually you were coming on Bloomberg and the price doubled at the open. We were coming out obviously. Terrible economic times, you know, the depths of the pandemic. What did that feel like when you're going out into the world starting to sell to public investors and the price just doubles? It was certainly very exciting. It was exhilarating. It was the first time that our company went public. The first time that I had ever undergone any of those types of experiences before. But in the back of my head, it was that saying that you're never as good or as bad as they say you are. And so just remember that. So tease that out for me a little bit because the big question is how much do customers keep ordering out in a high inflation environment? How much long-term sustainability and growth is there really? Even though COVID is now effectively sustained and we understand how to live with it, customers are continuing to order. That joint is during the pandemic. They're still ordering at about the same rates as those who joined us before the pandemic. And that's because eating out and getting things delivered are pretty complimentary. On the second point around inflation, you know, I can say that in the last 60 years in looking at the data, spend in restaurants and in grocery have only declined in two of those 60 years, including high inflationary times much higher than what we observed today. And so what I think I take, you know, solace in even though I see the fact that there is high inflation, is that customers are going to continue spending on food. And our job is to bring greater and greater affordability. More broadly the economy is in a tough position. Your competitors have announced layoffs and hiring freezes and slowdowns. Is DoorDash considering any of these? I think we've been fortunate mostly because most of our investments that happened during the pandemic really were meant to build new businesses. And those new businesses have continued to grow. New business is, you know, beyond restaurants and categories like grocery convenience or retail. New businesses overseas. You know, we announced a large acquisition in Volt, where that really helped double our overall addressable market to 700 million people. New businesses in building an advertising business. New businesses expanding our services and building a platform to help businesses build their own digital operations. Do you see DoorDash as more of a super app of the future? Or is it something different? Well, I see DoorDash as really solving two problems. You know, problem one is how do we bring incremental demand to all the physical businesses as they kind of figure out their own digital in house capabilities. And the second problem we're trying to solve is bring...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,984,2022-11-19 21:44:24
18371," Problem one is how do we bring incremental demand to all the physical businesses as they kind of figure out their own digital in-house capabilities and the second problem we're trying to solve is bring tools to these businesses. There's still a lot of competition in delivery. Who do you think survives the delivery wars? Who doesn't and why? Well delivery is a scale economy's game. You know, at the end of the day, you can survive even doing deliveries from a singular story. There's still mom and pop pizza shops and Chinese restaurants that do their own delivery. Do you see DoorDash as a challenger to like Walmart, Amazon? Well, I see DoorDash, you know, as a champion of local businesses and physical businesses. I don't think that a world in which we just get what we want to buy or consume for a few places is a world that, again, is as worth enjoying living in. It's for our job is to make sure that all of these businesses, all of the millions of physical businesses globally, can continue to compete. I do a lot of DoorDash, helps me be a working mom. Whenever I interview you, I get pings from dashers and some of them say they don't get paid enough. Some of them seem pretty angry. What's your response to them? We want the local economy to grow and to thrive. That includes dashers. We have three million dashers that come to the platform every single quarter. And so it's really important to me what they say. And it's, in fact, why, you know, the company, myself included, we still dash due deliveries in other words, once a month. You still do, do deliveries once a month? It's why we have a Dasher Community Council that we started three, four years ago now. I want to see one of your memos after a delivery. Are you sending notes to the head? It's not even after the delivery. I'm texting, you know, not texting while I'm driving, but texting after I complete the order. From your deliveries, what have you learned? Everything. All of the details, everything from pay considerations, everything from operations at a store, you know, which stores are a bit faster in their operations or more consistent, which stores are less consistent? Where do you find the last parking space in downtown San Francisco? All of these details matter. They matter for efficiency. They matter for driver pay. They matter for merchant earnings. And so as a result, you know, what I say to dashers is, please continue to talk to me. I'm just Tonya, a doordash. And we're always trying to, you know, make things better. We're not saying that we're perfect, but when we look at, you know, the data that we've collected, you know, the average dashers making $24.25 an hour nationwide when they're on, when they're doing deliveries. And so, and most dashers are pretty satisfied. So door dash has been expanding internationally. Sounds like you're on the road a lot. I'm on the road. I am on the road. US, Canada, Australia, Japan, where else? Where next? Germany, you know, Israel, Finland, a lot of the Nordics. So we're in 27 countries. And a lot of that is run by, you know, the VULT's team that we were lucky to partner with. Beyond VULT, how are you thinking about M&A? Are there any verticals or areas in particular where you might be interested in acquiring? You know, we have five businesses, the US restaurants business, the new categories business with a focus on convenience and grocery. Non-US international 27 countries are B2B business and are ads business. So we have quite a full play on M&A specifically. It's a high bar. M&A I think sometimes looks a lot better on paper than can be achieved in reality. And I think it's because you're talking about at the end of the day, combining human organizations, not just businesses or products or lines on a spreadsheet. I think you have to deliver upon that promise. And so for us, the bar isn't just does it add to our business, but does it actually add to our culture? We've been piloting rapid delivery, right, rapid delivery, but rapid delivery seems to be contracting. What are you seeing in your pilots? Is this somewhere you think you'll expand or no? So I think customers are always going to have expectations that go in one direction, right? I don't think we're going to want things delivered more slowly over time or at higher prices or with less selection. Our core use case right now is lunch and dinner, which is highly repetitive, highly profitable, which allows us to invest in things like fast deliveries. I take that with great pride. I also take with great responsibility, remembering to invest in...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,985,2022-11-19 21:48:48

On the David Rubenstein Show, here to peer conversations, I uncover the untold stories of the world's most successful leaders. Watch Wednesdays on Bloomberg Television. Welcome to the world of decentralized finance, Bloomberg's covering all things crypto. The people, the transactions and the technology, Bloomberg Crypto Tuesdays. Everything you need to get set for the started US trading, Bloomberg the open with Jonathan Tarot. Drilling down in the numbers and preparing you as only Bloomberg can, weekdays on Bloomberg. You bought Chowbottix last year, but shut it down. This is robotic, robotic kiosks, right? I'm curious how you're thinking about AI and, you know, Uber shut down itself driving stuff and they've started it back up. How are you thinking about AI and moonshots and some of this, you know, potential new technology and how it could help DoorDash or not? Like, is it just not ready for prime time? When it comes to platform shifts or new technologies, AI, autonomy, you know, other types of technologies, I tend to like to make the investment. I think that's a more appropriate choice to not miss the shift. However, I think it's very important to get the pacing right. I still think that the merits behind what, you know, we were trying to do in partnership with the Chowbottix team was the right idea in which we can help restaurants effectively build. You know, a cheaper cost product. That's ultimately what we were trying to do. But we weren't ready yet with the technology. You recently joined MetaSport. What's it like working with Mark Zuckerberg? It's been fantastic. You know, it's been a terrific learning experience, you know, learning from Mark all the way to the incredible management team at that company. It has a broad mandate of different products and as well as initiatives, and it's been a privilege. Facebook had a better, you know, very controversial platform. There's, you know, controversy about whether Facebook is really good for the world. Whether Facebook should have as much power as it should. How do you think about that? And how are you advising Mark about how do you use that power? With great power comes great responsibility. And I think Facebook has a lot of influence. And Meta's, you know, different properties is, you know, I'm sure you cover, you know, serve billions of people, you know, every single day. And that's an enormous privilege and an enormous responsibility that they take incredibly seriously. Like, should any company be more powerful than multiple governments combined? I don't think I see it, you know, exactly that way, right? Because it's still a contract between, you know, the company and its users. I think what's important for Meta to do and they're doing this absolutely is how do we set the guardrails, you know, to make it fair, safe for everyone? And this is very, very, very difficult. You're also an investor. I'm a member of different startups. One of them is Alchemy, Web3 company. Yes. Any plans to accept crypto? Any plans for DoorDash to accept crypto? Crypto right now is going through a period where it's trying to, you know, figure out what's next in terms of its use case. You know, I think everyone, myself included very bullish on the technology of what the blockchain enables. What do you think could be the future of blockchain technology in food delivery, in delivery, in general? Well, I don't know if it's going to get applied.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,986,2022-11-19 21:52:59
18373," of what the blockchain enables. What do you think could be the future of blockchain technology in food delivery, in delivery, in general? Well, I don't know if it's going to get applied directly to food or to delivery. I mean, I think it absolutely has the potential to create a new economic infrastructure, right? An economic infrastructure that can really serve as the basis for new banking systems, and et cetera. And so I think that's something more that's 10-general to the world of delivery. Obviously, payments is one part of what we do, but it's not the central thing. So we're going to do a little rapid fire now, a little quicker, fun, questions, favorite food. I've ordered from 1,100 different door dash restaurants. So I actually like to try everything. Your business idle? There are people in retail that I've admired, the people that founded everything from Walmart to Costco, the team in Amazon, in e-commerce, the team Elon Musk, and what he's trying to do. What about Elon Musk buying Twitter? If he has time to run a third company, I think that'd be fantastic for the world. You grew up in Illinois. You live in California. You like basketball, you're your favorite team. Bulls. Bulls, bulls, not warriors. I grew up in the golden days of Michael Jordan, Scotty Pippin, and actually both the early 90s, as well as the later 90s, in which they won three in a row. I'm still a Bulls die hard even though we're in the run patch right now. I hear you also like to run. You run marathons? Well, I don't run marathons today, so just to be clear. But I do run every day. So that's been my sanctuary, if you will, for the past 10 years. Your kids are still pretty young. How do you think having kids has changed you as a leader? I think kids are amazing in that they're experiencing the world for the first time. Being able to listen versus to talk at or to dictate an opinion, I think that's been a big lesson. I think the second one is the power of curiosity, especially my kids at their ages of two and four are asking the question, why a lot? And I think it's the best question. It's also so hard. And it's so hard to answer because it requires clarity of thinking on everything, on the most basic things to more complicated things. How has being an Asian-American CEO impacted your experience? Well, I think being an Asian growing up where I was the only Asian, and that was kind of my experience in Illinois, certainly had a big experience. And where it very directly, I saw firsthand whether it was bullying or discrimination. But I think if I were to more broadly classify that to the privileged position that I'm in today, I'm still a minority in the sense that there aren't as many Asian-American CEOs or founders, as maybe founders from other backgrounds. And so I think it's that reminder to one always recognize that. And then I think secondly to always keep the underdog mentality. Do you think you faced more challenges than others? Because Asian-American CEOs are so underrepresented. I mean, Asian-Americans are underrepresented in leadership roles in tech, full stop. I can't say that for me personally, in building DoorDash, was that the experience? But look, I think you're writing, calling out that when I look around me, when I look at, especially, public company, founder CEOs, well, hey, there aren't that many B when you start filtering for those from Asian descent. It's a much, much smaller list. And so I take that with great pride. I also take it with great responsibility. Really, and then again, remembering to invest in those who maybe don't come from privileged backgrounds, giving them an equal shot at it and to always to stay so hungry. You change your name to Tony when you moved? Well, that's five, yeah. To the US, you're five years old after Tony Danza. Yeah. Who was the star of who's the boss? Correct. I loved that. I did.

18374," Okay, well, let's just make it easier. Yeah, and so I walked with my dad to the immigration office and legally changed my name. Did life change and it feel like life changed after that? It felt a lot easier to say hi, I'm Tony. What's it like being the boss now? Honestly, I think I don't see myself that way and and I recognize that that's probably not how others view me, but I really view myself as a teammate and you know for me I think it's trying to make that actually true, make the reality of how I feel true to the perception that maybe others have of me as the boss and making that distance shorter and shorter.

Back in 1997, I was interested in the following question, which is there are a bunch of the dinosaurs called Soropod dinosaurs, which had really long skinny necks. So Apodosaurus is an example. Now it's had really long skinny tails. So I made a computer model that showed that in fact, the tail of these Soropod dinosaurs could actually act like a whip. A bull whip. Now the way a bull whip makes that cracking noise is because the tip of the whip actually goes about twice the speed of sound. And that crack is a sonic boom.

18375," like a boring legal seminar, a conference on the new rules around name, image, and likeness in sports. But far from dry and academic, the first annual NIL summit was in fact a flashy star-setter event put on at the College Football Hall of Fame. And Mingling amid the biggest current and former names in sports and media, there was a crucial cohort, the players poised to redefine what it means to be a modern college athlete. And the winner of male athlete of the year goes to Chase Griffin. Among those up-and-comers, UCLA's Chase Griffin. The UCLA quarterback is among the students becoming as well-known for making deals as making plays. And even in that group, Chase stands out. My name is Chase Griffin. What's up everyone is Chase Griffin. It's your favorite quarterback's favorite quarterback, Chase Griffin. When you look at it as an empowerment equity opportunity, it's really been unmatched in the sports world for any point in time since Title 9. After hardly a full year of name, image, and likeness deals being a reality, he already has more than 20 deals with major brands, venture, and charitable groups. All the while bouncing, graduating undergrad in just two years and fighting for playing time on the field. Chase Griffin out of the gun. We are joined by UCLA quarterback Chase Griffin, not just UCLA quarterback, but name image likeness superstar. I am sacked for this one. This kid could actually be the president of the United States someday. Chase isn't the starting quarterback for UCLA. He's not even the backup quarterback, but back on campus in LA, his nickname is President Chase. And after spending a couple days talking about his approach to business, sports, and equality, it's not tracking to think he might someday hold that off. His level of focus and maturity at the stage, I only wish I had. If you want to buy stock and human green, buy stock and Chase Griffin. When it comes to building generational wealth, it's not about the money that you make in college. I'm very excited that I made the amount of money that I made last year. I am even ten times more excited that I know how to make that money. Summer on any college campuses, mostly for the athletes, who are on lighter, but still regimented schedules. Attending classes, working out, a little bit of hanging out, and then more working out on their own time. Chase is no exception. The 21-year-old is a backup, albeit an impatient one. In the topsy-turvy past couple of seasons, dotted with fan-less games and COVID protocols, he's been able to start three games for the Bruins. Griffin, go to throw to the end zone. Why open again? Touchdown UCLA! Eating Arizona and narrowly losing to both Stanford and Oregon. That was inches away from Chase Griffin and UCLA being in cold, fledged, comeback mode. For Chase, UCLA felt like destiny. He was born just a few miles away before his family moved to Texas when he was a toddler. But beyond being a sort of homecoming, the school's history of athlete activism was a massive draw. I always expected from myself to have some sort of impact that was beneficial for more people than I interact with on a daily basis. And choosing UCLA, a lot of that went into me seeing myself as someone who reflected the same want to make things better. That so many of the people that UCLA prides itself upon be in the home for have done in the past. The legacies of former UCLA greats like Arthur Ash, Jackie Robinson, Karim Abdul-Jabbar and Jackie Joyner Cursey have had a wide-ranging impact on society well beyond the Westwood campus. Chase reveres these people, but he's perhaps most keenly aware of the activism of a more recent-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,989,2022-11-19 22:06:10
18376," impact on society well beyond the Westwood campus. Chase reveres these people, but he's perhaps most keenly aware of the activism of a more recent Bruin alum, the basketball player at O'Bannon. At O'Bannon, who was an ace-meth player of the year National Champ, UCLA Sports Legend is also a legal hero. I think NIL could be the next installment where we look back in 30, 40, 50 years and God willing, if we give him the roses he deserves, we add at O'Bannon to that list of UCLA grades. O'Bannon, who played at UCLA from 91 to 95, initiated a lawsuit that's widely credited for finally opening up the possibility of college athletes being paid for use of their name image and likeness. He sued the NCAA in video game publisher EA for antitrust violations, arguing that athletes should be entitled to financial compensation when schools used their likeness for game. In 2014, a judge ruled in his favor. And then on an episode of the shop, surrounded by O'Bannon, Diana Tarrassi, and LeBron James, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed the first ultimately successful legislation to allow athletes to receive endorsement deals. The Fair Pay to Play Act led other states to follow suit and ultimately led the NCAA in 2021 to relent, seemingly reluctantly. NIL payments were officially allowed as of July 1st 2021. Today is the last day where name image and likeness laws will not be on the books and kids will not be, if you will, not allowed to make money off of their name image and likeness. Making money from Jersey sales and endorsement deals is a way for players to share in the massively lucrative world of college athletics. This NIL thing is the wild, wild west. The NIL change felt like many things that happened very slowly and then it happened very fast. And I wonder for you having contemplated that maybe this was coming at some point, how prepared were you, what was your mindset when the switch flipped? Right. I mean, I still think everyone's trying to get prepared for the industry. It's still sort of like a wild, wild west. I wasn't really expecting anything. I was more just thinking about honestly getting ready for that season and capitalizing on everything that was happening. When NIL hit and it turned out I had action, I was like, oh, okay, well after this degree deal, which was fantastic. I was like, okay, I see how I can be a staple in this game and I see how I can get better over time. That's why I teamed up with my friends at Shell. Now in Shell, they'll hit and then boost my old deal hit. Then you keep on building clear code. Like you keep on building and you get better in the meetings. And most of all, you start seeing where your value can be best placed in these new opportunities. The headlines and storylines in the aftermath of the NIL change introduced visions of instant millionaire strolling campuses across the nation. You might think the NIL athlete of the year lives in Splendor or at least in one of those athletic halices that put most of our coach dorms to shame. Well, it's all relative to chase. All right, Jason. So here we are, world headquarters. Yep, this is where it all happens. So there's the kitchen right here. I actually really enjoy cooking. Oh, yeah. Yeah, this gas oven gets really hot really fast. I make pieces in there. This is the best appliance since the iPhone Air Fryer could put anything in there. I need to do these dishes right here. So no trappings of success yet. More a pretty average college dorm room. The fridge filled with leftovers, a well-used PS4. And of course, the requisite Godfather poster. It's a far cry from the lifestyle seen in some local news reports for NIL athletes during this first year. These are Robinson made headlines with an NIL deal with Lamborghini Austin. Lamborghinis tend to make more headlines than Muhammad Ali are Bruce Lee pictures. Some athletes are living in mansions driving Lamborghinis.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,990,2022-11-19 22:10:33
18377," Lampriginies tend to make more headlines that Muhammad Ali are Bruce Lee pictures. Some athletes are living in mansions, driving Lamborghinis. As far as I know, you're doing neither of those things. I see where you're living right here. It is with all to respect, not a mansion. Okay. How much of that is a conscious choice and what does it say about your approach to this? Right. I mean, first off, I look at this as my own room. I got everything I need. I'm cool with that. I'm cool with living below my means. I think it's important to remember that the volume of financial gain is completely overstated. And that's what it y'all is following. The media. And someone hears about a five million or $10 million deal. You've got to report it like, oh my goodness, people are going to read this. Hey, I'd count two things. Like, how many kids are even getting these deals? And then for the kids that do get it, how much of that is in liquor cash? And how much of it is in assets? If you pay for a $2 million house out here in LA for a kid to stay in the college, that's great. But as soon as they're graduated, they're not going to have that $2 million house. I say the same thing, you know, for the kids who are driving around in Lamborghini's and stuff like that. That's awesome. Like, that's super dope. And I know some of those kids. But, you know, someone paying for your lease is different than someone actually giving you the value of that lease every single month. You're investing it, saving it for a $1K, et cetera. I say all that just to mention that product deals and stuff like that are overhyped by the media. And they also can land kids in some trouble if they're not paying taxes on it. That's one of the distinctly unsexy and easy to overlook elements of the new rules. Even if an athlete's not getting cold hard cash from a deal, the value of any products given are subject to state and federal taxes. So, suddenly, what a player sees as free year and returned for some social media posts actually equals taxable income. And that requires the same forms you'd fill out as an independent contractor getting a check. I made a fair amount in NIO deals and I invested all of it. In my opinion, NIO is great. Doing all this is great. Making money now is great. But the most valuable thing I've gotten from all of this is, in the fact, I'll always know how to make money off of myself. All told, Chase has done more than 20 deals with major brands like Degree, Shell, and Boost Mobile. Along with venture-stage companies including Discord, Duffel, and Creative Juice. He's also made a point to work with charities like the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank, where he's already raised funds for almost 60,000 meals. Big, expensive cities have a lot going for them. But if you live in one, you've probably noticed that these big, expensive cities keep getting more, well, expensive. You could always move away. You might have just started working remotely, so there's really nothing keeping you there. But then again, moving is a hassle. Well, what if someone paid you 10 grand to do it? What if they threw in free office space, a bicycle, or a gym membership? Programs and cities and states around the US are doing exactly that, and they're getting a lot of interest. We've had over 50,000 applications. About 90,000 applications. We've had over 1800 applicants from all over North America. So are these nascent programs actually beneficial to their communities and the workers joining them? Or are they little more than flashy advertising campaigns for places looking for an injection of fresh talent? No one covers the world like Bloomberg. The writings on the wall for the bank of England, just oil has spray paints at the front door. Recessioning in Europe, UK, and possibly the US.

This is Bloomberg Daybreak, but like, Welcome to Daybreak Australia. We will be back. Welcome to Bloomberg Crypto. Music This is a song by Javion. I heard the opening. I just took that opening and I pitched it slow, or I think I sped it. At his desk when he's not making music, he's either networking with CEOs or investors he seeks out, or who seek him out, or negotiating new deals. Hey Mallory. I'm sure you tell you doing. I'm doing well. I'm turning on my camera right now. You have no worries. This is an average NIL deal. A brand approaches an athlete who can help spread their message to a demographic they believe the athlete can help reach. In this case, Direct TV is looking to market their NFL Sunday ticket to college students. It would be two posts, one post late August and one post on the first week of September. And the compensation would be 1200 per post. So it would be 400 total. Right. Are they video posts or are they, you know, picking captions? They can be either. It's up to you guys. That was pretty good. 400 above, but they had originally asked. So that's a win. So yeah, I mean, at this point after I do a Zoom or something like that, I either chill out, go back to land down if I was watching a movie or something, or, you know, go to YouTube, just start looking for more samples. This is Presidential K. It's a pretty simple interaction for Chase and for Direct TV. Negotiated over a couple of emails and Zoom calls, and papered with a contract Chase will have his dad look over before he signs. And Chase, who's made himself as much of a student of the new NIL marketplace, as he has a public policy at UCLA, says he understands why it's working. A brand ambassador with, with an athlete is more attractive to these brands now as far as a terminal investment than even a post by a famous actor. If there's any place to learn that sports are deep in the hearts of Americans, it's on a high school football field in Texas. Friday night lights in the Lone Star state might be the gridiron equivalent of Frank Sinatra's New York City. Making it there needs your something special. Chase Griffin, quarterback, class 19, Otto Texas. And Chase didn't just make it, he excelled. Let's talk about some of the top quarterbacks in the state. And when you look at that list at the top of it, you got to talk about Chase Griffin. I was lucky to play three years as a quarterback for Otto High School, which is a one horse town. We have great success. And so the town really shut down and came out and supported us every Friday night. Chase, right there. He's right there. I hope that if he can catch it. He does touch it on the boat. Chase, one word to describe that finish that game. God, that's it. Coming from a town like that where football is so prioritized, it has its pros and cons, but I think on the pros side, I learned how to win, how to get better, and most importantly, what it's like to build a...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,992,2022-11-19 22:19:18
18379," Their football is so prioritize. It has its pros and cons, but I think on the pros side, I learned how to win, how to get better, and most importantly, what it's like to build a team where everyone gets better. Emulating his UCLA alumni like Robinson, Joyner Cursey, and Abdul Jabbar, Chase is looking at the impact NIL will have not just for him, but the athletes that will follow. When the predecessors who have come before you have changed the world and made life better for everyone today, you can't help but ask yourself how the actions that you're taking now and the companies and brands and the NIL space that you work with are all cumulatively building something greater than any of us could foresee. I've actually, I've never moderated, so this will be my first time. It should be fun. I know my handwriting's terrible. The last day the conference Chase was asked to co-moderate a panel with Monique Nelson, the CEO for UNI World Group. All right, I'm excited to be here. UNI World Group is one of the longest standing multi-cultural advertising and marketing agencies in the United States. The firm works with brands like Ford, Home Depot, and Johnson & Johnson to help reach the black and brown communities. And they have big ambitions in NIL. For UNI World Group, the idea of this was pretty epic in that because we serve the undervalued, overlapped, and the underserved, we knew that this particular group of people would fall into that category. And we plan on being the premier practice for NIL athletes that are looking to do purpose-driven, media advertising, community level engagement work. UWG launched a program called The NIL to help black student athletes partner with major brands. But to help them understand how to do that, they brought on Chase to serve as a student-athlete executive in residence. For me, I do nothing without tremendous amounts of data for all of our clients. I really wanted to be thoughtful about this practice being very athlete-centric. If I were to build it or anyone on my team were to build it, it would not have the athlete at the core. When you're 18, 19, 20, 21, 20, to the best way to have credibility as confidence and the only way for confidence to be authentic. I'm actually learning on the job. I'm learning about the brand side of NIL, but I'm also trying to make sure that empowerment equity is built in, especially for black student athletes in the NIL world. ROI, return on investment. Both Chase and UWG see NIL deals as something much more than making money for students. It's also a potential investment in a community long overlooked. I think we're getting ready to stop boxes on a few of the people of L.A. A piece of each of Chase's NIL deals go to his belief brand campaign, which has raised more than $13,000 for meals for the L.A. Food Bank backpack program. But athletes giving back is only one side. I'm here with legal zoom to give you five tips on the NIL game plan. UWG and Chase believe having brands investing in the athletes, especially athletes of color, can be a force multiplier for these historically marginalized communities. When you look at the revenue, JIT and rating sports for the Bombass, what 88% of those athletes are black. So when you're doing stuff to empower student athletes in the NIL space, you're also helping to deliver on your promise. Now student athletes are not the only ones who should receive this help by any means. But statistically, by doing that, you're going to be delivering on your mission. Additionally, student athletes on average come from lower levels of income. So you're also delivering on that promise. And a lot of these student athletes are first generation, their first gen college students. Some of them first gen high school diploma. Some of them first time receiving the amount of money that they have had that day.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,993,2022-11-19 22:23:34
18380," Student athletes are first generation, their first gen college students. Some of them first gen high school diploma. Some of them first time receiving the amount of money that they receive in their families. This has been a wild first year in NIL. We all knew that there would be bags of cash around, right? There's always been bags of cash. There's cash everywhere. What we know is that that's not sustainable. We know that athletics has an expiration date on it. So for us, inclusion ultimately means this is just a part of you. It is a tremendous part of you and we are going to celebrate that part of you. But we also know that you're bigger than that. So we want to empower you to live past your expiration date for this part of your life. And quite honestly have equity in everything that you have poured yourself into as an NIL athlete. It may still be the Wild West days for the NIL industry. But in the first year, about a billion dollars in business was done with NCAA athletes. For the early leaders in the NIL space like Chase, they're striking a precedent for athletes that follow them. And that's important because collegiate athletes don't have that much time to profit. Only an estimated 2% of NCAA athletes go on to the pros. Even the hardest working are often limited by things they can't control. For Chase, it's been his height. I'm 5'10 now in high school after my sophomore year went up through for 3,000 yards. I was probably like 5'6"", 5'5"". I mean, I could arguably say I'm one of the best in the history of Texas high school football. But you know, I've gone through the height test where they'll call you out of class, shake your hand, look at you up and down. And be like, nice to meet you, you go back to class. It's a sad but timeless story for student athletes. And for Chase, his story is something he's not shyed away from. But embraced when it comes to his NIL deals. I'm frequently the smallest person on the football field, but I always strive to be the most impactful. My middle school coach told me that I would never play in high school. Chase's deals with degrees breaking limits team and clear covers inspired underdogs, allowed him to capitalize financially from football. Even the last season, he never saw the field for UCLA. I play football because I love the game. I play the football because I'm a good competitor. I love to compete and I play football because I'm good at it. At the end of the day, I don't play football for my livelihood, which is important to remember when it comes down to identity. I myself chase Griffin as long as I'm that I got something in this world. As he moves into the new season and focuses more on football than business, Chase doesn't seem much of a differentiation between the two in terms of his mindset. I wouldn't be surprised if I wasn't playing football in five years and it was running in Fortune 500 company, but I also wouldn't be surprised if I was winning a Super Bowl five, ten years from now. And either way, I'm going to keep on working at the tools that would align myself and my future with both. At the end of the day, you're always going to have yourself. If you can make profit off of yourself and know where you add value, in any world you're in, you'll be able to adapt and find ways to generate wealth for yourself. Part of what I love about business is you get to build things from nothing. I don't have any investors. All this is all money and this is me just building it. It's pretty much full service shadow banking with nobody in charge.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,994,2022-11-19 22:27:49
18381," No doubt, no So as you look back on your career, what would you say is the best investment advice you've ever received? Probably the best investment advice that I never received, but that I've lived my whole life around, is surround yourself with really good people. I thought about it just today like I do many times, you know, what makes a great investor. A great investor firm is comprised of people who are optimists and pessimists and realists because in the intersection of the debates that go across that wide range of personalities is where you find truth. It's part of the reason I'm so focused on freedom of expression. I see it my own four walls, the robust and fulsome debates around how we commit our capital, what defines a good idea, what businesses to build or pursue. That's what drives the success at Citadel. And I've been very fortunate in life to have always had a group of friends who really push me, who make me better. And here I get to work with three and a half thousand colleagues who in their ways make me better each and every day and collectively as a team, we've had the opportunity to have an incredible impact on the financial landscape around the world. You've got to explain this one to me. What does it mean when the White House says we're watching markets carefully? It means they have a Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. They have been in and seen it. Lots of Bloombergs. Lots of Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. What does it mean? What does it mean? What does it mean? It means they have a Bloomberg. It's a really a reminder, isn't it? Just how sensitive the markets are to any commentary about trade. We did see pressure on the U.N. We did see some pressure on the future. That is now being reversed. It is crucially important. And I think we've moved from this attitude from its indulgence, a waste of time, almost an illness that needs a cure. For something as universally important to human life as sleep, mysteries surrounding its necessity and utility have only just been recently uncovered. Some of our biggest discoveries were in the 1970s or 1980s, and so it makes it a really exciting field because it seems as though we're uncovering new insights each and every day. Some scientists are going further to find out how sleep and what happens there can be harness to further expand our understanding. It's easy to memorize things that makes you smart if you can spit back a lot of facts. But if you want to be wise, if you really want wisdom, you've got to know when and how and why to use that information. And that's what you bring to figure out where you're sleeping. Hello, good. How are you? It's so great to see you. Thank you so much for doing this. What do you think about all this love getting into? I think that was more last year. I think it's kind of a way of that past. No, I don't think so, but I think it's like any time that frankly, it went a lot of other people get into crypto, right? Other audiences too. It's when it's in the news a lot. When does that happen?

I want to start with a vibe check. Okay. What state of the crypto cycle are we in right now? It was hot. Yep. And then it got pretty cold. Hmm. Well, look, Emily, zooming back, because I've been in crypto for a decade, if you can believe it. We've seen crypto be really hot and then all of a sudden not. And so we've seen this before, however, I think one of the things that's a little bit different now is with each new crypto cycle, more and more people come into it. And so it's more and more pronounced each cycle. And I would push back on it's not. I think it depends on what area of the ecosystem you're looking at. We think developers think crypto and Web3 is still really hot. I am seeing a lot less of those. We're all going to make it hashtags. I am seeing a lot less of them too, although I am spending less time on Twitter, so maybe that's why. But with each cycle, there are new acronyms. What hasn't happened is a crypto winter in the midst of really serious global macro conditions. So we have inflation, kind of at record highs for our generation, in our lifetime. And then we have also a war that's broken out in the Ukraine. And we have a number of other factors going on here. So that's very different. There was some serious carnage out there. Socius, Luna, three hours. What's been your takeaways from what? I don't want to sit here and tell you that algorithmic stablecoins are bad, because I actually think they're really interesting. However, I think what happened is you had, in this case you mentioned, Luna and Tara, you know, that was an algorithmic stablecoin that was getting pretty widespread adoption relative to what the tech could do. I didn't realize you spent your teenage years living in Egypt and learning Arabic. Tell me about your upbringing. I was always uprooted. My dad worked for a large company and we were always moving just when I would get comfortable in one space. And I think actually that's pretty important if you fast forward and look at my career. I'm comfortable being in uncomfortable situations. You know, I didn't know a lot about venture when I got into it initially. I didn't know a lot about crypto when I got into it initially. And I was okay asking questions. I was okay not knowing the local acronyms or the Namanclature of a particular field. And I'm, you know, I'm taken right back to my teenage years in Cairo, moving from Houston, Texas one day to downtown Madi in Cairo the next day. You studied law? I did. You clerked for Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy. That's right. You became a federal prosecutor. And we're taking on prison gangs and the mafia. That must have taken a really thick skin. I was doing it at age 25. And now if I kind of take a step back and you know, I think that happens at different points in your career. Like, whoa, if I would have analyzed that a little more at the time. And I'm kind of in some ways glad I didn't. I just dove right in. Because I felt it fascinating. There was a human aspect to it. And people's stories. And I felt like those stories mattered. So I was drawn to criminal law and became a federal prosecutor. And I did cases involving violent crime. But then really mistrying cases. Being back in the courtroom. Being before the grand jury. Like the prosecutor you would see on TV going to try those murder cases. Doing those two hour closing arguments. That's right. And so moved out here to California. I died at the largest prison gang in the world at the time. Outlaw motorcycle gangs. Hostage taking. Bank robberies. There was really not a kind of.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,996,2022-11-19 22:36:31
18383," California, I indicted the largest prison gang in the world at the time, outlaw motorcycle gangs, hostage taking, bank robberies, armed bank robberies, there was really not a kind of criminal case by that point in my career. I hadn't done it, it was right around that time, 2012, one of my bosses came in and said, let's have that same energy that you brought to those gang cases, to those murder cases and let's go ahead and have you investigate this new criminal technology that we really need to look into and possibly shut this down. So you created the first crypto currency task force? How would you describe it? Fortunately, several of us in the government realized at the time, it's not possible, also not desirable, because Bitcoin is not an entity, it's not a person, right? It's a protocol and it would be like saying, let's go shut down cash. Let's go shut down the internet. It's not possible. Probably wouldn't be a good idea either. I was using crypto and technologies like the Bitcoin blockchain, because that's all that existed then. This is 2012, 2013 to actually uncover criminal activity. So I didn't think that that technology was bad. Frankly, it was a tool that helped me uncover the various activity. And by the way, it was a step level function improvement better than compliance by banks. I'll just go ahead and say it. That's a little bit controversial, but I had spent a decade subpoenaing large financial institutions and five times out of 10 didn't get back what I needed. One case I worked on and people always say, oh, you shut down the Silk Road. What actually happened? I was looking into something completely, not having to do with anything at all of the Silk Road and came across some, what looked to be some kind of odd activity. And it turns out that a couple of federal agents on the Silk Road task force out of Washington, D.C. were cropped. And that is the case that I ended up in dieting and I ended up prosecuting those agents and they both went to prison. So that's the aspect of what Silk Road case that I worked on. I would never, never have been able to uncover that criminal activity by those agents because they were federal agents, they knew how to cover their tracks. Had they not used Bitcoin blockchain. Right. So that technology right there, if they had just used wires or cash or bank wires, we would never have uncovered that. Just how hard is it to launch a crypto fund in front scratch?

It was a lot of what I call legitimate actors and crypto who wanted to usher in this new.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,997,2022-11-19 22:40:50
18384," Here in San Francisco at the Federal Reserve Bank, and believe it was there that it wasn't just Brian, it was a lot of what I'll call legitimate actors in crypto who wanted to usher in this new wave, this new ecosystem. And then we brought together the heads of all kinds of agencies, really in an effort to kind of talk about building bridges. You know, the government and the crypto industry were never going to see eye to eye on a lot of things, but we did think there were some commonalities. Coinbase is a company that has suffered, they've been losing share, the valuation of public markets has plummeted. Why do you think that is and how do you think it can be fixed? Yeah, well I think again a few things it's tied to. One, a large aspect of Coinbase's business now, of course, is trading revenue. And that's down when prices are down. And you know, the company's been very transparent about that long before going public. I mean, also if you look at its S1, it specifically identifies that. And just how volatile crypto cycles are. So I think that's part of it. It's judged by public markets as a technology stock or as a financial services company. By the way, I think it's both. I think it's not just a financial services company. I think it's so much more. I think it's really a portal to this whole new ecosystem. You were also on the board of OpenC until recently there's an insider trading situation or accusation going on there. Coinbase has also had employees accused of insider trading. How much is this happening within crypto companies and within the industry and how big a problem is it? I think crypto is under the microscope. So where you have a case, two cases, three cases in crypto ecosystem, which now is a trillion dollar industry. I think multi-billion approaching trillion dollar industry, you're always going to be able to find examples like that. So I don't want to make too much out of a handful of cases. That said, the company, Coinbase, OpenC, take these things incredibly seriously. Along with your position at Coinbase, you became a partner at one of the most important and most storied venture capital firms in Silicon Valley. That is Andreessen Harwitz. What was your experience at A16Z-like? There I met Chris Dixon and I met Ben Horwitz and I met Mark Andreessen and I had worked with them for just about a year, maybe a little bit over when they asked me to come and co-run their crypto funds at Andreessen Harwitz. Again, I jumped at that chance and I think really that speaks to the fact that as I said before, things are a hell yes or there are no and it was a hell yes for me. So Andreessen Harwitz is the kind of place where if you make a partner, you don't leave. How did Mark and Ben respond when you said, yeah, why don't you leave to start a crypto fund of my own? As you might know, Emily, they're an anchor. They're an anchor check into my fund and I'm very grateful for that. Mark and Chris and folks like them are also personal LPs. So I felt very supported when I shared that decision and I will say that it was not running away from Andreessen Harwitz, it was running to another opportunity. And you know, crypto is not, what do they say? It's not a spectator sport. It's like you're in it. It's very young. It's 24-7. It's global and it's hustle. And that's a trade-off. It's a life trade-off. And at this point in my career and in my life, if I was going to continue to make that trade-off, I just wanted to do it and do it in a way that was really true to me. So you struck out on your own? Yes. In some ventures, what gave you the courage to do that? What was the spark that lit the fire? Yeah. That got you to say, I need to do this and do this now. Sure. What I set out to do was to continue to invest in this ecosystem that I think is so broad that decision was very purposeful and the timing was very purposeful. We have an early stage fund that does seed stage, series A, even series B. And then we have what we call an acceleration fund, which is, it's not a growth fund. It's a crypto growth fund. And I think those are different things. But it's later stage. It might be crypto publics. Certain kinds of public tokens were set up to hold tokens and participate in the token ecosystem. Or later stage companies. I mean, there are now several crypto, many crypto unicorns. Space has become really competitive. Even though you say, you know, crypto has had its kind of ups and downs. The thing is, a lot of people in some of those last cycles have seen the kind of venture style returns that can be had in crypto. And so you've had a lot of new funds enter the space. And that's driven up competition. So what differentiates on venture then from, you know, all of these other crypto funds are even the.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,998,2022-11-19 22:45:24
18385," a lot of new funds enter the space. And that's driven up competition. So what differentiates on ventures then? From all of these other crypto funds, or even more traditional venture capitalists, like entries in Horowitz or Sequoia, they also have crypto funds now. Well, I think a lot of traditional venture capital funds now have crypto funds. It used to just be like a regulatory designation. It was like, are you an RIA, which is registered investment advisor? I would say for crypto founders today, it's not enough to just be an RIA, right? They, frankly, I don't even know if a lot of them care. That's a regulatory designation. What crypto founders today want to know is do you live and breathe crypto? Do you inhale the discourse? Are you part of the community? Do you participate in governance? Are you going to be staking these kind of crypto verbs out there? And if you're not really in this space full time, I think it's very hard to run a successful crypto fund. We don't have a hedge fund component. So we're not sitting here buying and trading and selling. That's a hedge fund structure. And there are crypto hedge funds. We're not one. We're making seven to 10-year bets. Just how hard is it to launch a crypto fund from scratch? You know, it's hard, but it's not impossible. We don't have a crystal ball. I don't know. I can't predict cycles, but I knew that we were in a cycle where you saw so much further an excitement around the space. And I already talked about what makes this different, but I think one thing also is we are a nimble strike force. We don't fish in the same pond. We have the crypto natives. We have efficient execution. We have operators, seasoned operators who really know how to stick the landing. And I think that's reflected on our culture. I would say the only thing that's changed in our strategy as a result of the market correction is really more of a focus on early stage, but we still have our late stage fund. And when we see valuations, which I think will still see correct, spoiler. I think we'll continue to see some corrections. And so we might deploy our later stage fund a little bit more slowly. It might not be on an even 50-50 cadence. And that's okay. Long-term, our strategy hasn't changed. Long-term, we're committed to this space. How much do you think valuations are going to correct? You know, it's just, I can't give you a one-size-fits-all answer because crypto is not a monolith. You have some crypto companies that really follow more of an enterprise-sass business model. You have others that are layer one protocols. You have still others that are consumer-facing applications. And I think one of the things we're seeing right now is the infrastructure layer. And that's where we're spending a lot of our time, by the way. And we think more and more use cases will come about when the infrastructure layer is in place. So my own view is we are not rushing to deploy. We're certainly not getting caught up. You do get VC FOMO and I try not to avoid that. You know, look, I think it's very easy to get into that mindset, right? It's because it's a competitive sport. It's a competitive space. And I think I'd be lying if I said that that doesn't influence anyone. I try to, what I do, and I think I do differently, is I try to take stock of that. Oh, that's the FOMO mentality kicking in. That's bad. Again, you don't want to over-crack, though. What we look for is we look for amazing founders. It doesn't matter if I think valuations will correct. If there are amazing founders, there's a huge tam. We also look for what's your regulatory plan? If you're launching a token, what's your plan to comply with the law? What's your plan for security, by the way? We've seen a lot of hacks in the space. We want to really dive in there and make sure that the founders have been thoughtful about, especially if they're custodian customer funds, keeping those funds secure. If it's a cross-chain bridge, what are the exploits? Have you changed your strategy at all, given the downturn? What? Have you backed out of any deals or decided not to do certain deals? Because the conditions have changed. Don't you raise the phone? We have decided not to do certain deals. We've never backed out of a deal. We have decided not to do a few deals. Because we think that pricing was ahead of progress, candidly. And we might have been wrong about that, Emily. We might have been wrong about that. But I think if we were wrong not to do a couple of deals, better that we might have been right. Because if we were wrong about that, I think we can find a way to still invest in those projects later. Well, one thing I'm hearing is that a lot of dry powder has just stepped up. Because all these funds raised a lot of money raised. What was the biggest fund ever for a single person, not just a woman, anyone? Yep. Are you confident you're going to have a place to put all that money? I am, but if I don't have a place to put it, I'm not just going to go willing, nearly deploy it. One of the things that we told our LPs even during.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,999,2022-11-19 22:49:39
18386," You're gonna have to put a place to put all that money. I am, but if I don't have a place to put it, I'm not just going to go willing, nearly deploy it. One of the things that we told our LPs, even during that period when we raised our fund, which was when crypto was undeniably still on a bull run, we said that we are going to be pretty steadfast, sticking to a tier deployment cycle. And I think one thing that's changed is that might have lengthened. It certainly hasn't shortened, but we will, again, we have, we feel very good that we have the capital to back routines when we see them. So you think we're gonna fall behind the United States? I think we already are falling behind. Fall behind, China. And we're falling behind. Watch Bloomberg surveillance early edition for the news you need when you need it.

And I happen to think that if you live in a digital world, you're going to want to own digital goods in that world. You're not just going to be satisfied to rent them, which is what we do now. We buy our content from walled gardens without digital scarcity, which is what NFTs unlock. You don't really own anything. You're subject to the whims of a platform. And I think NFTs and digitally scarce goods fundamentally change that. I think you'll see NFTs back again, but we are spending a lot of time in the infrastructure layer. Like I tell you, zero knowledge, technology, scalability. We think of that as like the plumbing. If you think of the fiber-hubtic cables. Remember, you couldn't have had YouTube and Netflix with dial-up. You couldn't have streamed content. The same is true of crypto use cases. We think that there will be a lot of new use cases unlocked when the infrastructure is there, when it's more efficient, when it's more user-friendly. And so we're spending a lot of our time there. President Biden issues this crypto executive order. There are a number of ports that are coming due. What do you want to see from the administration when it comes to regulation? Are you optimistic that we will get there? Yeah. We were so delighted to see that executive order. This is not something you should normally be delighted about. But why we were is because it was to us a real recognition that this is a US government saying this field isn't going anywhere. This field is growing. It's growing so much that we are going to direct every single agency in the federal government to come up with a plan here. I think we take a step forward, but then you see, we're a big government. We're a big system. We have states. We have local entities. So we take a step forward with the EO. And then we take some steps back sometimes too. And I think what I see as crypto founders are confused by that. They're starting to think, well, I could go to this jurisdiction where there's a single regulator. And you don't have 50 states with different rules. It's the US government that needs to start taking stock of the fact that right now, Emily in China, there's a quarter of a billion ECNY wallets, a quarter of a billion. We're still talking about whether there should be a government central bank digital currency. We're still studying that. So you think we're going to fall behind the United States? I think we already are falling behind. Fall behind China. And we're falling behind. What are the dangers of falling behind China? And the rest of the world. This is years ahead.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1000,2022-11-19 22:53:54
18387," I think we already are falling behind. Fall behind. And we're falling behind. What are the dangers of falling behind China? And the rest of the world. This is years ahead, so I don't want people to take a headline and say, oh, I think the US dollar will be, you know, no longer the global currency. Reserve global currency. I'm not saying that now. But fast forward decades. And if you no longer need to use the dollar because you have an alternative, I think that's a real problem. What would we use instead? Well, I think that there are going to be stable coins out there that people who have access to a smartphone will use. There is a demand for it. We see our 285% year of your growth with stable coins. So people are clearly liking the idea of this. Now, again, there have been some spectacular failures too, but not all stable coins are created the same. But I think the important thing is that we really do need to not just quash innovation. What do you think of how Gary Gensler, the chair of the SEC, and how he's approaching it? One of the things that I hear from founders is that they're very confused because they get told, come in, register. Just come in and talk to us. But you have the one company who's done the ultimate act of going in and registering coinbase, filed an S1. And still, you know, there's a lot of saber rattling still going on, I think. And again, I don't want to single out the SEC, you know, and I don't want to suggest that anything they're doing is bad. I do think, though, that right now there's a lot of confusion. And one of the pieces of confusion stems from the fact that, you know, and it started with the ICO, Mania back in what 2016, 2017, I can't even remember which year now, where the SEC was very loud about securities. A lot of them were securities, but the space has changed. And so to still view it through the ICO lens, when so much has happened over the last five years in the space, I think is a mistake. What do you have to say to the skeptics out there who just don't believe in the future of Web3? And don't see where this is going. Yeah. I would say don't judge the current state of innovation by the end state of innovation. I hear from a lot of these skeptics. And by the way, I'm friends with a lot of these skeptics too. I don't only want to live in a crypto bubble. They want to see the use cases, especially if they're not technical. Well, when am I going to use it? What will I use it for? And I think one of the things that's not appreciated is how quickly the infrastructure here is catching up. And once you have kind of a, once you have really scalable blockchains that can handle a lot of throughput and are very efficient, I think that unlocks a whole lot of use cases. People are spending more time on screens. That curve is up and to the right. Whether we like it or not, that is the future. I mean, those who have kids know that kids spend more time online. They want digital things too. And I think to dismiss it, it is a bit generational. I do find not always, but it is a bit generational. If you talk to kids about being able to have money online, they instantly get that concept. They're comfortable not having to hold something in their hand to think it has value. Take us to the end state. Do Google and Amazon and Facebook and Apple still exist? I believe they will still exist. I mean, it depends what you talk about when you talk about the end state. I mean, I think that, you know, I think for decades, those companies will still be around. But the important thing is I think this new ecosystem is going to represent a challenge to them. I do think that those entities, decentralized forces are coming. And we'll cut into those entities, profits and revenues. So we have a little rapid fire section. If you could belong to any altcoin tribe, which would it be? Gosh. There is no way I'm answering that because I will get trolls on Twitter by every other altcoin tribe. I'm a crypto maximalist.

18389," You for a chain that now has about 3,000 restaurants, he insists on staying true to the values that have defined Chipotle from day one. I think I'm really open-minded, but I really do want to protect the heritage of Chipotle and make sure that we don't lose the essence. It's a powerful blend, a consistent mission that sustains the brand with a commitment to innovation that drives the business. Chipotle's future depends on investments that address both priorities. Jack Hartung embraces that challenge. He's always had a passion for what we do next in our company because he's always been really a champion of growth. I've got to make sure that the financials, the balance sheet, the way we source through, the way that we provide through, the way that our business works, needs to be strong so that we reach our full potential. I love working with people that can figure out how to thread the needle between the numbers and the purpose. Frankly, not everybody can do it, but luckily Jack does it really well and we're pretty fortunate to have him at our company. Chipotle's growth in the last five years has been nothing short of spectacular. The companies market capitalization has more than quadrupled. All this, despite a global pandemic that's disrupted the restaurant industry and all this following a food safety crisis that caused sales at the company to crater and forced a shake-up in the sea suite. Individually, the team was phenomenal. Individually people were very talented, but it's almost like they didn't have the right people in the right places to handle how big the brand and the platform became. The enhanced food safety procedures, enhanced standards and training. They really enhanced the management team, took marketing dollars, transitioned them to more effective marketing, brand building efforts with a big focus on reminding consumers of why they love Chipotle. The breakdown was the human capital. The breakdown was in culture. That's what they've repaired. That's why they're coming back stronger. What have you learned in your CFO position going through those crises? Which one was the most challenging? The food safety issue was the most challenging because we were alone in that one. That was unique to Chipotle. The pandemic is certainly a challenge, but everyone's in it together. The things that really got us through it is we stay true to our purpose. So during each of these challenges, we made sure we invested in the things that made Chipotle special, invest in higher quality food, invest in our people, and then invest in our growth and invest in things like technology. We have the same around here. I think it actually comes from West Point. We will choose the harder right over the easy wrong. How do you and Jack work on things like that? Those black swan events, those things that can be fundamentally changing for you as a company? When we are successful in focusing on the really important things that can strategically drive growth for us, they seem to be having resiliency in these things. These unexpected events. The other thing I think is to make sure you have a strong balance sheet, to make sure you can weather the storm. And we've had a strong balance sheet, we've never had debt. We've always had more cash in the balance sheet than we need for our normal ongoing business. And that has come in, you know, great, you know, really handy. Chipotle carries no long-term debt, and its free cash flow almost tripled in 2021. When you think about the future, how do you take advantage of this? And what is the flexibility that that enables? What it really affords us is we're going to be able to invest in our future, no matter what. Like we accelerated our open, we accelerated our pursuit of new restaurants sites during the pandemic when some of their restaurant companies were laying off their development team. Chipotle not only expanded its footprint over the last two years, it reshaped its restaurants, a venture to drive through dining that began several years ago became a thriving profit center when the pandemic struck. The thing that's changed the most is just most of our restaurants now have a Chipotle. So three years ago, we had maybe five or six Chipotle and now we have over 350 and 80% of our new openings have a Chipotle. The sales and our...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1003,2022-11-19 23:06:53
18390, So three years ago we had maybe five or six chipotle and now we have over 350 and 80% of our new openings have a chipotle. The sales in our chipotle restaurants are higher and our margins are higher too because the digital orders are our highest margin transaction and when you can serve the customer through the chipotle without the delivery fees that we pay and the customers pay it's a great margin opportunity for us. The convenience of chipotle means contributed to soaring digital sales in 2020. There was little erosion in 2021 even as in restaurant sales returned to 80% of 2019 levels. Meanwhile membership and loyalty programs has boomed giving chipotle valuable insight into its customers omnichannel preferences. What we've seen is that our digital customers they come the most often and they spend the most each time they come. Customer loyalty could face a test if inflation continues to push higher. Chipotle hiked menu prices roughly 9% in 2021. Jack Hartung says it's not just wages and food costs that are putting on the pressure. It's hitting everything. Titting material is too for a restaurant so our new restaurants are costing more as well. You guys have had incredible pricing power. Is there kind of a tipping point where it's like enough? We haven't seen it. Why is that Jack? Well part of it is we've over the years been slow to raise prices. We've always tried not to go to the menu board to raise prices whenever we've had a challenge from a cost standpoint. We'll do other things to try to find efficiencies somewhere along the line. We raised prices in the second quarter of last year. We did that just to cover the cost of raising wages. We raised wages up to 15 dollars. It was an average of 15% increase and we raised prices just to cover the dollar cost of that. So we didn't increase our margins. Our margins actually went down but our profitability stayed the same. Our customers actually said we really applaud what you're doing. We're fine with a 4% price increase. Not a chicken burrito that's 30 cents but the fact that you increase wages to that extent we'd like you to eat a more Chipotle. CEO Brian Nichol has warned that Chipotle may raise prices again if cost pressures intensify. With the cost of eating out already at historic levels consumers may just have to get used to paying more. The industry is used to have type of inflation call it 2% you know level inflation. They take you know a little bit of price to offset it flows through and margins are just naturally restored. The fact of the matter is labor was the pressure point. So the industry today is definitely sitting on a high single digit price versus what is typically a low single digit price inflation or level of menu price increase. In relative terms everyone has to do this. In fact I would say Carl we could be more patient than others because we own all of our restaurants. When you're a franchise organization when you have franchise ease that have borrowed to invest in their business they can't necessarily afford to let inflation eat away at their at their ability to pay the debt for very long. It is full speed ahead when it comes to store growth. Chipotle just up its goal to 7000 from 6000 restaurants in the U.S. thanks in large part to strong performance it's seeing its smaller towns. Based on we're already in more than a hundred of them. Based on the ones we're in based on the results so far which are extraordinary we think there is as many as almost a thousand more restaurants. So even though you're talking about a small town with you know maybe 20 30 thousand people the sales volumes are almost the same as if you know we're in a city like Chicago or a Chicago suburb but the investment costs are lower the rents are certainly lower and the operating costs are lower so you end up getting higher margins and higher every time. Chipotle reaps the full benefit of these return since it owns and operates all its stores and advantage that's not lost on Wall Street. It's extremely unusual in not only restaurants but from a restaurant stock perspective to have a large cap stock that's growing its unit level economic model meaning the revenues are getting better and the margins are getting better as growth is accelerating it's just it's like almost unheard of. So there's little reason for Chipotle to begin franchising in the United States but for the chain's 45 international restaurants Bloomberg intelligence notes that partnering with local operators overseas might boost margins and accelerate expansion. We're open to the idea of some kind of franchise model you know there areas of the world.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1004,2022-11-19 23:11:07
18391," operators overseas might boost margins and accelerate expansion. We're open to the idea of some kind of franchise model. There are areas of the world where it's going to be harder for us to own and to run the businesses ourselves when they're a process of bringing our digital system to Europe that's going really, really well. We've also opened up some alternative sites. It gives us great optimism that international is going to be a core force and hopefully not to this future. Coming up, Jack Hartung shows me around one of Chipotle's newest restaurants and he explains the economics of menu innovation. When you bring something new, does it bring in additional customers? Does it bring existing customers more often? This is Bloomberg. Lots happening on Wall Street. I'm quite encouraged. The center is holding. Need to catch up. This is Bloomberg Wall Street week. I'm David Weston. We've got the information and insight. A lot of these areas still have very, very good valuations. From businesses most influential and instrumental. It's knocking it out the bolt. Well, it's not a great time to be speculative. It's time for a pivot. We're talking about a significant hit to our standard of living. Bloomberg Wall Street week. Live tonight with Replays All Weekend on Bloomberg Television and Radio. No one covers the world like Bloomberg. My team thinks 2023. We avoid a recession. I'm a little more skeptical about that. China and the US both do not want to see nuclear force in the European continent. The regulators here in the Bahamas are ongoing with their investigation into ATIAC. With unmatched reach in resources from more than 120 countries, the moment news breaks 24 hours a day. Bloomberg, your global business authority. Like to Poetlay's menu, Jack Hartung's professional resume isn't patted out with exotic ingredients. After earning a bachelor's degree in MBA at Illinois State, he went straight to an accounting job at Cooper's in Lyberton. His next stop, 18 years at McDonald's. They called me up and McDonald's was just a few miles down the road. And this place is great. And what they told me was great about it was you started in one area, but then when a job opens up, they would post it. And you can interview for it. So I felt, well, that's not great. So I could learn a job. And then if I'm looking for another opportunity, I can interview for it. And if I've done a good job, I'll get those opportunities. Which is what happened? I am curious when you went from McDonald's to Chipotle where folks like Jack, here you've got the established company. You're going to a startup. I mean, did people think you were crazy? Yeah, I mean, a lot of people thought I was crazy. In fact, one memorable person was a CEO of McDonald's at the time because I had a great career at McDonald's. And the future looked really, really good. At Chipotle, it was in its infancy. And it had this vision for food that was like no other than I've seen. How much of it was? McDonald's owned 90% of Chipotle. How much of it was, all right, Jack, keep an eye on these guys. You know, that's how it started. And it wasn't keep an eye on it, but it was more, their food culture was very advanced. Their business culture was not. And so it was more of bringing some of your experience to Chipotle, just so you can get them on a stronger track. Once I got into Chipotle environment and I realized, oh my God, I want to be part of this. There was a passion about what we were doing. So it wasn't a finance job anymore. It was a job that was really changing food culture in this country. And it was a mission and it was a mission that I totally bought into. Chipotle's culture and mission have long differentiated it as a place to eat. With restaurants competing fiercely for employees in the wake of the pandemic, companies are going to have to show that they are great places to work as well. It's not just about that person coming back to work in the restaurant. They're going to come back, but they're not going to come.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1005,2022-11-19 23:15:32
18392," so that they are great places to work as well. It's not just about that person coming back to work in the restaurant. They're gonna come back, but they're not going to come back and work the way they did before. I think that the companies that win are those that are investing in their employees, their teams that are developing a strong culture that people wanna be a part of. The real win on a micro level is if restaurants can figure out how to make that employee work better and more efficiently, but in a way that makes them more satisfied. At this new location just outside Chicago, Jack Hartung told me what it will take to build a workforce to meet Chipotle's goals. You've got to start with attractive wages, but then you gotta go wavy on that. You've gotta offer developmental opportunities, promotional opportunities. We have 100,000 employees, as we grow from 3000 restaurants to 7,000 restaurants, we're gonna need 200 or 250,000 employees. So our future depends on hiring great crew today, that will be great managers in the future. Double the locations, double the staff, and along with investing in people, Chipotle plans to invest in technology to support them. There is so much still that can be done with artificial intelligence, robotics. When you think about our system, there are a lot of processes that frankly, people don't love doing cutting, incurring avocados in the restaurant, not a fun job, very repetitive. I think there's a way where we could use robotics to help us do that. And then as you think about artificial intelligence, we could be better at figuring out how many avocados we have to cut and court today, so that we never run out of walk-in-mole throughout the day. As digital orders have surged, Chipotle has adapted its processes. The most dramatic change has been the addition of a second make line. This is very familiar to customers, our front line, and this is what for the first, you know, call it 18 years of Chipotle, this was you come in each Chipotle along the line, you interact with the crew and you customize your meal. We've got this separate make line, and it's digitized, and so the orders come in, and they're really kind of staged so that, if you say, at noon, I want to come in at one o'clock, we hold that order, and we will send it to the crew like a maybe 10 to one. So it's ready right when you pull up your car. How do you manage these kind of two different staffing needs, right? So you have the right amount of people at the right time. We spend a lot of time projecting sales. Of a lot of it is, you know, it's part, our part science, we're trying to bring more science and more AI into it. Because if you get the right sales projection, then you know exactly what your staffing needs to be. So if you get the sales right, you can get the entire restaurant staff perfectly with just a couple of people. Our average restaurant now does about over a million dollars per restaurant in digital sales. Data science meets culinary art and Chipotle's commitment to menu innovation. By releasing several new items each year, management hopes to boost same-store sales. It seems to be working, but it's more complicated than it looks. The most important thing is to make sure that the economics work, meaning when you bring something new, does it bring in additional customers? Does it bring existing customers more often? There's always going to be trade off from, you know, one menu item to another. And there could be economic either advantages or disadvantages. So we just want to understand that, you know, when a customer comes in, if they're trading from a high margin item to low margin item, that's going to be a loser for us. And any new offering must meet Chipotle's rigorous sourcing standards. It will take us a year and a half from the time that we are experimenting in the test kitchen to will put it into a few restaurants to see how does it work operationally and do customers like it. But it'll take us a year and a half because we've then got to build up splicing. It's a challenge, but we take our time, and we're not going to roll it out before it's ready. Jack Carton clearly places a high value on the customer experience and the experience of those who work at Chipotle restaurants. He's a people person and a family man with five children and 10 grandchildren. Even his favorite hobby brings family into play. It's a passion for collecting and restoring classic cars. I drive here very conservatively, so I'm not ripping down the highway or anything. But these are cars that I really cared about, and really admired, and aspired to when I was young. And so I still love these cars. There's a bonding that goes on as well, one of my sons is a mechanic. I feel like, I feel so teilpacked already.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1006,2022-11-19 23:19:59
18393," These are cars that I really cared about and really admired and aspired to when I was young. And so I still love these cars. There's a bonding that goes on as well. One of my sons is a mechanic. So he's a mechanic for Tesla. And he loves cars. And so we send time to car shows together. We'll go to auctions and look for cars. And so we have a great time. And he knows how to fix the cars. And I know how to drive the cars. And so that's kind of the partnership that we have. But we have a great time together. Up next, sustainability is much more than a buzzword for Chipotle. And it's more than figures on a spreadsheet for Jack Harto. Jack is 100% bought into our purpose of cultivating a better world. And he tells me what a chief future officer has to learn not to do. Every CFO knows how to read financial statements and go through what a CFO is supposed to do. But I think what you have to do is put those aside at some point. This is Bloomberg. The top names in climate change are on Bloomberg. I want everybody committed to the kind of action that we need. We have a global emergency now. You know, we're still putting 162 million tons of manmade global warming pollution into the sky every day using the sky as an open sewer. That's trapping as much extra heat as would be released by 600,000 erosion of class at Tom and Tom exploding every day. That's what the scientists tell us and the data shows it. That's crazy. That's why we have a third of Pakistan underwater. That's why we have the historic heat wave in China. Nothing comparable to that. That's why the heat records are broken every year. And we're seeing an increase in the flows of climate refugees crossing international borders that are due to vastly expand unless we take action to solve the climate crisis. Nobody covers climate change like Bloomberg, your global business authority. Essential pillar of Chipotle's business has always been a commitment to fresh food and support of sustainable agriculture. From responsibly raised meat to local and organic produce, the company's crafted a supply chain carefully over decades. Every company is facing supply chain challenges. Chipotle has a great infrastructure. They have a sophisticated team. They have relationships with their suppliers. A lot of whom are local. And a lot who have gotten to know Jack Hartung. He's done much more to build those relationships than just sign checks. Within my first year, I was spending time on hog farms, cilantro farms. Believe it or not, I drove a combine. That's the size of this restaurant to harvest rice, organic rice. And these are things that they had a lasting impression on me. Because when I would go back to my office and I would be working on spreadsheets of financial analysis, I saw how the hogs were raised. And I saw how they were raised eventually versus with our farmers. And I'm like, I've got to make sure that our financials and all everything we spend money on needs to be thoughtful so that we can invest in the better way, raising food. It's more expensive to buy this food. I would try to make sure that the economic model supported investing in this food and not through higher enterprises. Jack is 100% bought into our purpose of cultivating a better world. One of those key plants, this sustainability, and doing the right thing through the planet. And as a result, he's all in bored with investing and even understanding the implications on the business, and then obviously our purpose. We know what matters. We know what matters, not just to our customers, to our crew as well. We do the right things. We do what's right for our people. We do what's right for the farmers. We do what's right for the environment. For the last 20 years at Chipotle, Jack Hartung has made strategic decisions based on what matters, even in times of turmoil and crisis. Looking back, more often than not, it's paid off. So I wanted to know what he sees when he looks ahead. What's the opportunity for Chipotle in the next 10 years that excites you the most? Well, I think the most exciting thing is that we're not even halfway to our potential in the US. So when I joined a company, it was a few hundred restaurants. And we were talking about 1,000, maybe 2,000. Here we are at 3,000 talking about 7.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1007,2022-11-19 23:24:13
18394," We're going to have a way to our potential in the U.S. So, you know, when I joined a company, it was a few hundred restaurants, and we were talking about a thousand, maybe two thousand. Here we are at three thousand, talking about seven. I believe as we approach seven, that number is going to be higher. A lot higher? Well, I don't know how much higher, but for sure it's going to go up. And international, we're just scratching the surface. And we've been very responsible in the international where we've taken the same food ethos. We've owned the restaurant so far. And so it's been a very slow, let's make sure we get this right. You know, sometimes you have to go slow before you go fast. And that's kind of been our approach. We've gone slow, and now we're positioning ourselves to, I think in the not-to-distant future, go fast in the international. So those are the two things that are exciting the most. All right, what's the challenge for the next ten years that is on your mind the most that maybe and keeps you up at night? People. When we run all of our restaurants like we do today, we have around a hundred thousand employees. As we grow, we're going to need more employees. We promoted 19,000 people last year. 90% of our promotions were in-house. So we always have to be on our game in terms of hiring great people that believe in Chipotle and our purpose today. That have the desire to learn how to cook, learn how to run a business, learn how to lead people. If we do a great job with that, the future only gets brighter. So we're in great shape from the people's standpoint, but that's something that I'll always worry about. Are we hiring and developing the right people? You don't want to be losing people. If we lose people, then we might have to resort to franchising. And it's hard to follow a purpose during tough times, like during a pandemic. It's hard to invest in things like food and people. You win margin to under pressure. When you own your own restaurants, you can make those investments. How do you see your role as CFO changing in the next ten years? Save to say it's changed a lot in the past ten years. How about the next ten? It has, you know, I think it'll just evolve with the challenges. I mean, again, I'm already fortunate that I've been able to get involved in real estate and supply chain. I spend time in a restaurant, spend time in suppliers, you know, spend time in international as well. So I always, I already get to spend a lot of time in a lot of these areas. I think in terms of evolution, it's probably more a matter of the folks on my team, some of which are new that you've been following in the last few years, some of which have been with us for a long time, to help them rise up so they can take on bigger responsibilities. And we become a bigger company. Everybody in the company will need to step up and take on bigger responsibility. So my main goal will be to make sure that they're ready to take those on. What's the skill set that you think every CFO should be acquiring in this environment? I think being a digital savvy is probably the most important thing. Trying to stay, you know, keep up or even stay ahead of where technology is going. Not just in the next five years, but in the next ten or fifteen years. I think that's the most critical for CFO. What's the best advice for the future that you give to somebody a person who just got promoted to CFO today? I would say be really, really curious. Try to learn as much as you can about every part of the business. Every CFO knows how to read financial statements and go through what a CFO is supposed to do. But I think what you have to do is put those aside at some point. Go spend time in your business. In our case, spend time in restaurants. Spend time with suppliers. I think get to know how other people within the business, what their challenges are, what their opportunities are. What really makes the customer care about your brand or your business? And I think the more you do that, when you go back to the spreadsheets, you're going to be thinking about things from a different standpoint. Your priorities might change a little bit. And it might change how you make investments to make sure that the customer experience is better next time, rather than the margin is better. If you invest in the customer in a way where they become loyal to your customer, the margin will come. Hard felt and hands on. Jack Hartung is put Chipotle in position to go forward by always making sure the business goes back to the start and stays true to its roots. That's what makes him Chipotle's chief future officer.

One covers the world like Bloomberg. My team thinks 2023. We avoid a recession. I'm a little worst skeptical about that. China and the US both do not want to see nuclear force in the European continent. The regulators here in the Bahamas are ongoing with their investigation into ATIAC. Unmatched reach in resources from more than 120 countries. The moment news breaks 24 hours a day. Bloomberg, your global business authority. Thank you so much for joining us. Thank you for having me. What drives you? What drives me? Oh my God. I have the idea of as simple as this uninclusive world, a world where people see themselves reflected. Because I was supposed to be invisible by your accounts. I was supposed to not be where I am. I was supposed to have disappeared a long time ago. And every turn in my life was about visibility. Yes I will be this person who's not supposed to be here. Yes I will fight through the hard times. Yes I won't give up. But even though I was sort of the token black editor in the industry in the 90s, I knew even then that I needed to bring people up with me. I needed to bring other people up with me. And so that's really been a part of maybe it was growing up in a family of six. I don't know. When you run a team, how do you instill that work ethic that kind of answering emails at all time? I mean you know I think you see an example, if you're an editor who leads and has launches and is never in the office.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1009,2022-11-19 23:32:45
18396," answering emails at all time. Yeah, I mean, you know, I think you say an example, you know, if you're an editor who leaves and has lunches and it's never in the office, you know, you don't really sort of instill faith. My team know that, you know, we're on a mission, we have to reflect the world we live in, we have to, you know, reflect the, you know, the beauty of multiculturalism, we have to reflect, you know, the beauty and diversity and inclusivity. So everybody takes it really seriously, and we really have intense conversations about the side guys and the world. And so, you know, I'm very lucky to have a team who are as passionate and, you know, I could call my team, you know, I could call somebody at 6 a.m. or they can call me at 6 a.m. and I'll pick up, they'll pick up. So, you know, we have something very special that we've built over the past sort of five years. But there were difficult moments, right? I think the first time, one of your first issues, you thought that you could have been fired for it. Is that right? I mean, I lived in America, I lived in America for a bit and I was working for W magazine and there was talk of Brexit and of course Americans were like your country's really, you know, xenophobic. So, you know, I came back and I thought, you know, I'm going to be welcome with open arms and they're going to love me and oh my god, literally back to them by fire. But I remember thinking, you know, I wanted to create a magazine where every woman could see themselves, you know, where every woman, regardless of the backgrounds, regardless of their age, could just literally see themselves. And at the time, now it looks like it's the norm when you look at other magazines. But in 2017, that was, that was a radical idea. But I also remember thinking, you know, with my background, you know, I've lost so much and gained so much that I thought, if I'd loo, if I'm fired, I'd rather be fired for what I believed in. I'd rather be fired for creating a magazine that reflected the world as it was and try to sort of create a second-rate version of someone's vision. And that continues. I mean, there's this idea of always pushing forward. Yeah. Right? What's the end? How do you measure success? How do I measure success? I'm definitely not not financial. I mean, I think it's more about, for me, when I'm really exhausted, when I'm really tired, when I'm really questioning if I can go on, you know, I walk on the street and I see a little, a little girl, a little black girl who's, who's seen the magazine and it's the norm for them all, a curvy woman on a traitor palace who's like, thank you for, you know, seeing me, you know, that makes it worth what that for me is success. And anybody who knows or has known me for a while, will witness that that for me is success. You know, my jaw is done when that happens. Do you think, I mean, do people come up to you? They do, but it's always, it's always in a positive way. It's always thank you for seeing us, you know, but I can relate because, like, as I said, you know, by all accounts, I was meant to be invisible, you know. So for me, shining in light on people and making them seen, it's natural for me. They say that the fashion industry is changing, you're changing it. Are others around you changing it? I mean, now, you know, you look at other magazines and seeing real women in there, it's no longer a radical act, seeing, you know, people of color, women of color on covers is no longer a radical act. So it's being normal, you know, it's been normalized. And for me, I'm quite happy when I see that, you know, when you put Dame Judy Dencher on the cover, and she's 85 years old, and the world just laughed at it. Nobody questioned her, you know, should she be on the cover or, or you put, you know, a girl with a, a hijab on the cover. And it's not a problem. That for me shows that, you know, we're advancing, we're progressing. So, you know, progress on me is very important. Which is important. And so how do you take care of your team? How do you build a team around you? My team, I mean, some, you know, somebody said to me once, when you build a team, make sure you employ people, you like people, when you see them working towards your office, you're just so excited to see. That was it. Being good at your job and sort of a connection and being excited to see, you know, team members, because you only have good as your team, you know, no.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1010,2022-11-19 23:37:12
18397," and sort of a connection and being excited to see team members because you only have good as your team. You know, no man is an island. I don't create the magazine on my own. And so it's great to have a team who you respect and who's views you respect. How do you think you're seen by your team? Do you have to be fearful? Do you have to be... I'm a worker, I work very hard. But I think I'm pretty open. You can have conversations with me. Ultimately the final decision rests with me, but I do listen. I like conversation. I like interaction. I hope they think I'm a good boss and that's really all you can hope for. They work on a very good magazine. They can get other jobs anywhere. So the fact that they have there makes me think that they must be happy. How do you see the publishing world changing? So people buy less magazines. You've been doing pretty well in terms of selling more. But in five years, how does it look? Five years ago, let's go back to ID when I was 18. I inherited a magazine. But you'll come out. It was all about club kids. You had to be out there. The only way you could see street fashion was through ID. In 2017, I inherited a magazine. But now I oversee a brand. The magazine is sort of the highest, the best paper, the best photographers, the best cultural messages. But at the moment, when you manage a brand, it's not just about that. It's about digital. It's about video. It's about audio. It's about events. For somebody who's so forward looking, it's so great for me. People always ask, oh, it's a magazine instead. When we launch a cover, Instagram is our cover essentially. We find a way of sort of making it work hand in hand. It's so great for me. I think how do I just been doing the magazine? I probably would have been bored. The magazines aren't dead. They're going to work in hand with digital platforms. Also, I'll tell you something. New readers of folk, young readers, don't necessarily come to us through the new stands. They come through that, did you sell platforms or audio videos be put out? Yes, now it's increased 10fold. Do you think that will change the kind of readership that you will court, the age of your readers, but also where they come from? Yes, I mean, at the moment, I think the readership is getting younger because of the whole digital landscape. I hope that as we move forward, we have new readers and we also keep our loyal readers. Do you think there's ever a time where we actually won't have print magazines anymore? No, I think print will always exist, sort of at lunchtime digital, but it'll probably be something more precious, sort of better paper, something more collectible that you want to keep in your house, almost like artwork. So, no, I don't think print is going to die. So fewer copies. See you a copy. But more quality. More quality. You know, almost like a book. The table book. I love that. I find that. Me too. While Tesla's in the like make for good headlines, the reality is that even if every car on the road today won electric, it wouldn't be enough to curb global emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions from transportation account for about 29% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. So what about the other 71%? Buildings across America burn fossil fuels to operate. What we want to do is make that all electric. Instead of burning oil and gas to give us the energy and electricity we need, we want to do 100% clean energy, all electric. We want to turn buildings into Tesla's. Just like a Tesla or an electric vehicle is all electric with no fossil fuels, we want to do that with our buildings. And if we can do it in one building, we can do it in all buildings. And if we do it in all buildings, we'll reduce 30% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1011,2022-11-19 23:41:26

Because when you subscribe to Bloomberg, you won't just get news. You'll get insight into limitless possibilities, knowledge, and inspiration to feed your ambition. So before you invent pioneer, disrupt. Before you change the world, Bloomberg. You're recently on TikTok. Yes. Is that fun? Well, not so much fun. I literally have to be held back. But the brilliant thing is, I'm so curious. I mean, I like all the digital platforms. I really like to keep my finger on the poles. I'm not one of those people that leaves work and just shuts themselves in. I really want to be out there seeing the world as today. All is beauty. So I'm very curious. I have a very curious mind. And I'm glad. I'm glad. It keeps everything moving and exciting. So is that for Gen Z? Is that a commercial purpose to get also get closer to that? No, it's just out of curiosity. I've always been like that. I've always wanted to know what's next. I didn't want to be the one that's just being told, oh, you're 50 or whatever. I pay attention to everything. But the world is such a beautiful place for me. And it goes back to my childhood again. Well, the biggest challenge to grow the brand in the next five years. We still keep it relevant. We have such great digital traffic. Almost 6 million every month to Britishville. But I'm really excited about overseeing the European Volves as well, Spain, Italy, Germany, and France, and mentoring a whole new generation of editors. When there was this whole agonization, the whole world thought there was a global view that was going to dominate. But it's very much about local conversations, as well as global conversations. So I learn from these content leads. And I hope that they also learn. So the local global conversation, I'm very excited about moving into the future. Do you think it changes if we're in a recessionary environment? So you have such a glamorous lifestyle, or what you sell is so glamorous. Is it impacted by the cost of living or inflation of what we can live through? I mean, you know, I remember a few years ago, I put Taylor Swift on the cover, and the by-line was by better, by less. And it was a radical concept at the time. But now we all talk about sustainability. We know we can't keep shopping every day. We know we have to buy things that last. Things that help the planet. Things that we can pass on to sort of other generations. So I think that really is the conversation of the fashion industry is having right now that I find so exciting. And it's going to be sort of, you know, people are going to have less money, so they have to buy things that last. And I'm really excited. And these are real changes. It's not just a real change. It's not just conversation. It's actually happening. Do you think fashion brands always need to have a political point of view when they're great injustices? I think fashion brands can do more. I feel that having a black model in your show or having, you know, a feed on your Instagram post, it's not enough. We need diverse voices.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1012,2022-11-19 23:45:47
18399," Black models in your show, or having a feed on your Instagram post, it's not enough. We need diverse voices behind the scenes. I always say that I talk to all the CEOs I know we need to employ more people from diverse backgrounds, because that's the only way you can reach out to more people. A variety of voices is always better than just one. I also say let's not just have interns, let's have people on all different levels. That's what I keep talking to people about. Do they listen? Some listen, but I think since George Floyd was murdered more and more companies, sort of made pledges to people of colour. It's a slow process, some have taken it seriously, and some are still working their way through it. But we have to keep on. The problem is that you can make a pledge and then follow through. You have to really focus and keep asking that question for people to follow through. Do you feel like you're a guardian of making sure that when you get promised something, they'll do it and you'll hold them into account? Yes, if they promise something that I ask for, then I will literally wear you down. I'll literally chase you until you keep your promise. That's just who I am. We actually have one of the diverse cabinets here in the UK with Liz Truss. Is that important to you? It is so important as somebody who came from another country and was well-canned by the UK. It's very important to have a diverse cabinet. That's how change happens. Going back to what we discussed before. That's how you understand people who are on the periphery or who've been others. It's so important to have a diverse cabinet. But this you think in terms of policies and what they can bring to the table or just also seeing a daily cabinet. How many effects on policy? How many effect on the parties themselves? As well as policy. For me, it's about policy that makes people's lives better. I know you're also very close to Ghana still. There's a pretty scandalous anti-LGBT bill getting through. It's so funny. I was invited back to Ghana a few years ago by the President. It was the year of the return. I remember the last time we were in Ghana, we were fleeing. I really supported the changes. I love the changes that we're going through. But yes, they do have an LGBT problem. Some friends and I signed a whole. I don't know if you saw it. We're doing what we can to change things on the ground. I think you can't also sit in the West and tell the country what to do. It's about forming alliances on the ground and seeing what is needed and how we can help. Whether than standing on our soap boxes, going, do this, do that, do this. That's through what grounds were trying to change from with it. Yes, from with it. Trying to change from with it, talking to LGBTQ members and asking them what they need and what we can do to help. Rather than I say, do this. This is how you do it because we don't live there. You have a memoir out. Why put it down on paper? You know something about when you turn 50. What? Something about when it's your 50th year at Vogue. I got married this year. I'm normally not someone who looks back all the time, but it felt like the right time for me to do that. I just felt that a lot of young people see people like you and I and they think we just got here and we were always here and for me it was really important to share the story of a journey about successors and failures. That's the reason why I got here. I just wanted to share that story with young people. I just want to see people who feel like they're on the outskirts.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1013,2022-11-19 23:50:08
18400," I got here, I just wanted to share that story with them, sort of young people, as well as people who, you know, feel like they're on the outskirts of, you know, the outside of the industry, really. Do you feel like an outsider? I think I always feel like an outsider, but as I said before, you know, I grew up African in an African household in England, you know, different languages, different foods, and I go to school and I've been in England. So I've always been about duality, I've always seen myself as an outsider, but also an insider. And even when, you know, I took the job at British Folk, I was the black gay working class outsider, but, you know, I've been in the industry since I was 18, so I was, in essence, an insider. So that's really, it's the other duality that plays out in my life. No. Well, who do you think made you the person you are today? I know you left home twice, right, Ghana, but also you had to leave your home. Yes. I mean, the puzzle made me who I mean really is my mother. I mean, I mean, I love my mother. She taught me about sort of beauty. She taught me about clothes, about fascism. She also taught me that beauty came in all forms, that, you know, women were beautiful, no matter what shape there were, no matter what color, what religion. And so that really stayed with me. And, um, I guess that my creativity comes from her. And of course, I also had a military father. So the idea of precision and organization and sort of thinking ahead also comes from him. So the best of both worlds. How did your father, I know you had a difficult relation with your father. How did your father shape the person you are today? It's a funny, I should ask this question, because I never thought I was like my father growing up. You know, I was very shy, very sensitive, you know, a little, a little spacey. I prefer the company of women. To men, my dad was sort of, you know, a sort of, that's how we're there in disciplinarian. You know, you had to, you know, be here at a certain time. You know, he grew up as an iron fist. And I thought, you know, I'm never going to be like, here, you know, he kicked me out of the house, you know, when I was 18. And, but I found out that over the years, when it comes to work and discipline and sort of organization, that is him to a T. Japan's critical role in the global economy is changing as the world we calibrate. After decades of stagnation, Japan's leaders are forging a more innovative and sustainable path forward to revitalize the nation. Corporate giants, policymakers and pioneers tell us how they're doing just that. Every week on Japan ahead, right here on Bloomberg Television. I think that it's hard to put your head around any narrative. Let's just be honest. We've had sort of a shift in our we in some sort of circulation fears moment. People were talking about that all day yesterday. No one covers the world like Bloomberg. The writings on the wall for the bank of England just oil has spray paints at the front door session in Europe, UK and possibly the US. We are out in full force celebrating election victory. A former president, Lula, that's with unmatched reach in resources from more than 120 countries. The moment news breaks 24 hours a day. Bloomberg, your global business authority. So at some point you lose your eyesight. What was that like? Yeah. Basically I have sort of very high myopia. So I've never had great eyesight and I went through a series of sort of repnod detachments for to be exact and with each detachment I was.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1014,2022-11-19 23:54:29
18401," And I went through a series of sort of repnall detachments for to be exact. And with each detachment I would sort of have to end up looking down in a contraption for about three weeks. And in the dark room, it was very harrowing, it was very harrowing time in my life. But I always say you know you don't have to have vision to have vision. So in those dark rooms my imagination was even bigger. I dreamt bigger. And I came out to sort of the last surgery and the cover I did was for W Magazine with Rihanna as the queen, with a golden eye. And I looked back at it and I thought oh my god there are the eyes, some limit, some limitily. So yes, it was very challenging. And even to this day, you know, I go for checkups to make sure my eyes are okay. They're great right now. And you know, the more I look after myself the better. The better I'll get. But it's amazing you power through adversity. Do you ever think actually this is too much? Have you ever thought this is too much? I mean there have been times when I felt this is too much but it's not in my vocabulary to start. It's not in my DNA to start. You know, I am my mother's son, my father's son. You know, the edge to move forward is always there. And that's why you know, when I was young I would always get up and work. I had a reckoning touch when I still got on a plane to go shoot the Hollywood put folio. But now I'm learning to say no. Now I'm learning I can't do that job. I can't fly. No. It takes time but it comes with age. It takes courage to say no. Right? So when you look at all your covers and there's so many beautiful ones, is there one that's special to you? Well, I say to someone, they're like my children. I always have a favorite child. But I'm especially proud of the covers we did in lockdown. When the world had essentially shut down, you know, the teams were sort of scattered all around London. And I had to go back to the days of I.D. when you know, you had to really create user imagination. And we had a series of four covers, Judy Dinch. When they said, you know, anybody over 60, she stayed at home. The essential workers cover a cover of landscapes just so people could take a breather. And the activists cover when George Floyd was murdered. And I really think we create covers that, you know, in years time people can look back and see what the time, that period was like for me, an artist always has to reflect their times, to paraphrase Nina Simone. And that's really important for me. I mean, there was a bit of controversy with Linda van Gelista. Yes. Yes, I mean, you know, there was a complaint that, oh, you know, she should have looked a certain way. And for me, I've known Linda in the 90s. I've known this incredible icon who really defined what a model should be. And I also saw my friend go through really dark days, you know, due to the complications for surgery, literally disappear from the world, really not the Linda the world news. So when we were doing this cover, it was the collaboration. She wanted to be that Linda that everybody knew. She wanted to feel good about herself again. And I wasn't going to deny her that act. And also, you know, whatever I would like to say, whatever a woman wants to do with her body, it's up to her. So, you know, I'm very proud of Linda and I'm very proud of that cover. I mean, sometimes you're almost like an activist. Is that how you're like a fashion activist or a political fashion? I'm so, but I'm definitely a creative, but you know, I've always believed, you know, look at my life story in my book, you know. I wasn't like I kept saying I wasn't supposed to be here, you know, had my dad not left. I don't know even what would have happened to my family. So even when we ended up in a room, two rooms in a voxel, six of us, we were so happy to be there, penniless, but so happy to be there. So, you know, every day, I just, you know, I'm an optimist and I know it's not the most fashionable thing, but that's why I'm sitting here with you today. Bye. Edward, thank you so much for your time today. Thank you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1015,2022-11-19 23:58:52
