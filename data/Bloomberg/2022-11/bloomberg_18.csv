17447," C is from a work in progress version of the game. Everything you see is potentially subject to change. Po-ly. This, if they can live up to what they showed me, it's game over. It all looked incredibly impressive. They had enough action, enough narrative beats with just the right amount of tension. They touted how each of these NPCs, there are thousands of them, each one with their own daily routines and everything. We've greatly enhanced our crowd and community system to create the most believable city in any open world game to develop. So yeah, so people were certainly blown away by this demo at 1E3 awards and just people left the theater just in awe. What they didn't know, of course, is that the demo was completely fake. Fake demos are common at E3. Studios put together builds of games to show off what they tend the game to be like rather than the actual state of the game. What was unique about this demo was that it was impressively long. It kind of plays into this idea that CD Projekt is very much a market and driven company and so demos were really, really important to them. So it was really important that they make this demo blow people away, which it did, but that might have come to the cause of like some time they could have been spending on the game. A year later, at E3 2019, fans will get another big surprise. Whoa! No way! Oh, what?! Oh! Please, look! The audience is so excited! I'm being there, I'm walking the streets of the future, is really going to be breathtaking. You're mistaken! You're a brisk! The Cyberpunk trailers showed gorgeous cities, beautiful lighting, really cutting-edge technology when it comes to the rendering of the game itself. People were very excited to be immersed in this gorgeous Cyberpunk world. They saw over 8 million pre-orders, which is a ridiculously large amount for any title to sell, let alone pre-sell. And you saw the stock price start to go up and up and up and up into the right, you know, pretty much in a straight line. If you just look at like the Polish stock market, like the Wig Index, when CD Projekt stock was at its high, it was the largest stock in the index. And that was around the time that they announced that the game would be coming in April of 2020. Behind the Seaheens, people were pretty shocked that they were saying April. I don't think a single person who worked on that game actually thought they had a chance of coming out in April of 2020. So in April of 2019, I published an article for Kotaku about the making of a game called Anthem, which was a game from Byware that was disastrous in many ways, and the article kind of ran through why that was. And afterwards, they started hearing from other developers who had stories to share that they said sounded a whole lot like Anthem. The deadline is unrealistic, the direction keeps changing, things are floundering, we're going through a lot of problems. This sounds exactly like what you wrote about Anthem. Around that same time, perhaps coincidentally, I heard from VCEO of CD Projekt Red who wanted to reach out to me specifically to talk about Crunch. CD Projekt Red had a reputation for Crunch, especially during the development of Witcher 3. Their management wanted them to have a reputation for treating workers well and not forcing them to go through Crunch. So Marchinewinsky, who is a co-founder and co-CEO of CD Projekt Red, came to me and said, hey, I want to make a vow right now that we're not going to force anybody to Crunch, that people will not have to work mandatory overtime on this project. Over the course of reporting, Bloomberg has conducted interviews with more than 20 current and former CD Projekt staff, most of whom requested anonymity, so as not to risk their careers. CD Projekt declined a comment on the process, or provide interviews with this story. The company would end up delaying the game three different times, first pushing from an April 2020 release to September, then November, and once again to December.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,61,2022-11-17 02:12:04
17448," The company would end up delaying the game three different times, first pushing from an April 2020 release to September, then November and once again to December 2020. In order to meet the deadline, the studio would scale down the size of Cyberpunk's main city, as well as canceling some features. And while those measures helped, developers still said they were under significant crunch, including one former audio programmer who claimed to work up to 13 hours a day, five days a week, and stating he had seen friends with lost their families over this. This was not a big secret in the office that the game was not going to be ready. But a similar sort of thing happened with Witcher 3, and a similar sort of thing happens with a lot of games, where they don't seem ready until suddenly everything just clicks. Some of the best games ever made, like we created through this process. I don't know that it's the most efficient or the wisest way to make video games, but it's what a lot of people do. I think that management there has genuinely tried to change it, or at least said they wanted to change it, but it has proven very difficult to change that when you make games in this one specific way. Some of them see crunch as part of their core culture, that all of their games that they've made under crunch have been successful, so it must be a core element to the magic recipe for creating good games. And that's really not the case. We've run studies and seen that at eight weeks of working 60 hours plus, the output of a professional is the same as if they were working 40 hours a week. So chronic overwork degrades how effective someone is to the point where then it becomes negative, and overworking them is just getting a less and less productivity. And so these guys, the people at CD Projekt, having made the Witcher 3, were kind of riding on that high, you could call it arrogance or confidence, or whenever you want to call it, of having made the Witcher 3. And I think that like having a certain level confidence can certainly be a good thing, but in this case it could also be dangerous because it kind of blinded them to the reality, which was that this game wasn't going to call us. And the reason why I felt ashamed is because I think it was going to fall in. And what he did is because level 1 must wake him up, not in his qualities of being different than the other people in the game. So many pictures entertainment is reeling from what may be the biggest and most devastating computer hacking in Hollywood's history. Hackers attacked in waves, first crippling Sony's internal systems, then leaking five Sony movies online. Today the US government pointed the finger of blame directly at North Korea for the devastating cyber attack against Sony Pictures. Sony pulling the plug on the interview, saying it will not show the controversial comedy about an assassination attempt on North Korea's leader. The Sony Pictures hacking was taken very seriously because it was an attack on the free world. What we have been building in terms of our civilization and our freedom and our ability to exchange information freely have been disrupted by a country that we knew very little about. North Korea has reportedly made attempts to steal COVID-19 vaccine technology by hacking from the Citigua giant Pfizer. The Justice Department has charged three North Korean hackers over a wide ranging scheme that included the attempt theft of billions of dollars for multiple companies. Despite so many attacks blamed on North Korea, there was not much known about the people behind the hacking attacks and my aim was to reveal who these people are and what they are like, what their operations are like, and on what their dreams and fears were.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,62,2022-11-17 02:16:18
17449," And my aim was to reveal who these people are and what they are like, what their operations are like, and on what their dreams and fears were. My name is Sam Kim. I'm a reporter for Blue Murg News, and I wrote a story for Business Week about North Gun hackers. My story is about people who are sent from North Korea to countries like China to hack the regime, spy on enemies, and make money. North Korea's cyber abilities began about in the 1970s with a lot of students going to countries like Russia, China, and even East Germany to learn coding. It was aimed at improving the productivity of factories at home, but in some time in the 1980s and 1990s, the current leader Kim Jong-un's father Kim Jong-un thought that it would be a good idea to develop a team, an army of people who could hack for North Korea's military. They began this team of hackers who would spy for the North Gun regime and also go out there and make hard currency for the regime. I think Kim Jong-un takes the hacking ability more seriously than his father. He also enjoys a bit of tech sadness as well. He's often shown traveling on his airplane where on the desk there's a Mac computer. He understands the importance of computers, he understands the importance of employing technology to improve productivity of his economy. North Korea is an isolated country with its economy pretty much dilapidated nowadays. It's been under increasing pressure and sanctions from the US and the international community basically. It does not have the resources and money to build a kind of conventional weapons that other countries are able to build. So what happens is North Korea concentrates its resources on building nuclear arms and missiles, which exports called a symmetric weapons. It's the kind of weapons that gives North Korea an instant edge. In terms of cyberhacking abilities, in that context, it doesn't cost them much money. But if you have the right people and if you have the right training, you are able to cultivate an army of people who are able to penetrate into computer systems of other countries. That's what North Korea is after. But if you consider the fact that there are only about 1,000 IP addresses in North Korea available and many of them are basically loaned from Chinese communications companies, you can kind of tell why North Korea is willing to send its hackers abroad rather than operate from within. What's the matter with operating from within? Well, first of all, it would mean that a lot of information would have to be coming in from the outside world, which could risk exposing the government and the people to whatever truth there might be about them. So they're sending their trained hackers to China and other countries where access to information is better. But at the same time, because these are allies, and also because they have their diplomats stationed in countries like these like China, they're able to regulate and control these hackers better. But formally, North Korea denies engaging in hacking and described accusations to that affect as enemy propaganda. It took me at least half a year to track down these people. It felt like a war goose chase in the beginning.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,63,2022-11-17 02:20:30
17450," No. It took me at least half a year to track down these people. It felt like a wild goose chase in the beginning. Because, see a lot of the people like these are protected by the government in South Korea. But, at the end, I was able to find a person who had pretty extensive ties to the North Korean defective community here. And then, I was also able to gain access to the people who had actually done programming hacking from North Korea before coming to South Korea. And Jung is one of them. Jung actually is not a real name. I knew before meeting Jung that he was in his late 30s. But when I actually met him, he looked at least a decade older. He wouldn't open up. I mean, it took me, I think, at least an hour to make sure that he would trust me enough that he would share with me his life story. When he was first sent to China, he was a student studying computer science at a university near the border with North Korea. And he came back and realized that there was a lot more to do in China because he had more access to information. And he asked that he'd be sent back to China. And there was also recruitment going on for people who would actually do coding officially, but really hacking from North Korea. So, he applied and he got the job. Once he got to the border, he crossed by foot and from there, he took a bus. And then, when he arrived at the station that he would spend years in later, he learned that that three-story building in the heart of a city was actually provided for free, actually, by a Chinese man who had business ties in North Korea. There were actually two other people that I had met. They all said that they'd go on to this freelance website for programmers and clients from around the world would come and give them orders, give them jobs to do. Some of the jobs given to Jung were cracking open, commercially successful, antivirus programs. And once he was able to open that up, he replicated that program into another product, which his client would repackage as a whole different product to be sold to other people. He also created what we now call BOTs. They are very popular online games, including lineage. He would create a BOT that would just roam around without any supervision from the user and basically trade items without the users on that game. He would grow that BOT on lineage and sell it for almost $100. Another defector said the money from clients was wired primarily via PayPal to accounts controlled by minors because they were the only ones with access to legitimate bank accounts. Jung had to make at least $100,000 in a year and he doesn't get to keep most of it. Actually, most of that money goes to the minors to the North Korean regime. But if you don't meet the Korea, the minors will make sure that they'll put enough pressure on you. And if that happens repeatedly, you will face the growing odds of being sent back home. Among the three people that I spoke to, there's a common thing that they all tell me, which is that on every Saturday, they have to do this propaganda session, which is basically about gathering all the hackers together into a room and they have to recite whatever message, whatever lines come from Pyongyang about the Kim family, about socialism. If you're especially someone with a free set of mind, that's stressful. One person actually was really stressed out what he heard about North Korea. Once he was in China during the propaganda sessions, he just couldn't take it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,64,2022-11-17 02:24:51
17451," Once he was in China, drinking the propaganda assistance, he just couldn't take it. The Chinese were the Chinese, the Chinese, the Chinese, the Chinese, the Chinese. Jiang was a senior member of the unit he belonged to. He was good at Chinese as well. Whenever a senior North Korean official came from North Korea to check on the hacking units in China, Jiang would accompany that official. He doesn't provide me details, but he calls it unsavory instant that happened between him and an official that he was traveling with. And that altercation prompted him to defect. But there was no one that he could turn to after defecting. He would, in disguise, roam around China. He called me that he actually enjoyed it. He actually enjoyed the freedom of, you know, not being known to anybody. Just roaming around a country that was huge. How did he make the money that he needed to carry on? He did the same thing he did at the North Korean unit. He would take orders, he would reverse engineer a software to make money. But at one point, he said he was just sick and tired of it all of a sudden. He wanted to find a place where he could just settle down. And he contacted South Korean authorities. Now, he lives in Korea. He met a woman here. You know, last time I checked, they had a baby. He worked for a software company. Ironically, an antivirus company. What keeps coming up in my head, even long after I spoke to these people, is there was one common thing about them, which was the sense of disillusionment. One day had access to outside information. One day, we were able to freely roam in the Internet. There was a spark. And once they realized that there is a discrepancy between what they think is really happening and what notary is telling them every Saturday morning, that's when the spark gets bigger. That little fire is what eventually drives them to decide to leave, even if it takes a huge risk on their lives. Music Music Music",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,65,2022-11-17 02:29:14
17452," Will we become the roommates of the 움직ed Beat? Since they started popping up in the 1950s, malls have been the quintessential American shopping experience. Ustling temples dedicated to the wonders and excesses of retail, food service and entertainment, the rise of the mall coincided with the growth of the suburbs. The heyday of the malls really is the 1970s, sometimes referred to as the malling of America. They really thrived at providing some sort of public gathering space, some sort of social life in addition to actually getting people places to shop. Over the past few decades before then, lots of developers were building malls and it kind of coincided with the growth of highways. So as more people started traveling and interstate started being built, developers really wanted to put something to attract people to stop. To look at an average American mall today, however, and you'll see a very different picture. Closed stores and empty hallways became the norm in many malls even before COVID-19 delivered them another set of problems in 2020. So what happened? This is the story of the rise and fall of American malls. When malls work best, they survived and thrived thanks to their anchor stores. Those are the stores that are on the edges of the malls and that are outward facing to the parking lot. So if you're a shopper, you're going to walk through one of these big, usually a department store. So if you're thinking about macy's or sears or jc pinney, those are called the anchor stores. So once shoppers are done shopping there, maybe they wander to the middle part of the mall, shopping at the other apparel shops or even going to buy some food. But you really had to have a reason for people to shop in the first place. As anchors bring in all those people, they tend to pay very little rent. Around 80% of income from mall owners come from the inline stores inside the mall. Over the past few decades, malls have been facing challenges from all sides. The first being, there's just too many of them. As early as in the 90s, the malls were beginning to compete with each other. We have a lot more retail square footage per capita than Canada. We have only seven times more retail square footage per capita than Europe. After the 2008 financial crisis lowered retail spending across the board, malls and especially their department stores also had to contend with a new challenge that was growing fast. Mall started to suffer in the early 2000s with the rise of online shopping. Suddenly, they didn't have that captive audience who had to go to the mall to buy something. You didn't have to get up, get in your car, drive all the way to the mall and then see a bunch of other people. You can just do it from the comfort of your own. Department stores overall have become less relevant over the years. Many have fallen totally off. That's Sears, JC Penney. Several bankruptcies in this space have really hurt the industry. But as department stores go, so does the mall oftentimes. So if department stores start closing locations, that means they're usually leaving malls. This is the Green Briar Mall in Southwest Atlanta, Georgia. It's in many ways emblematic of the problems facing malls today. It's been there since 1965. So for more than half of a century, it's been serving this area of Atlanta.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,66,2022-11-17 02:33:36
17453," Lums facing malls today. It's been there since 1965. So for more than half of a century, it's been serving this area of Atlanta that's predominantly black and also as middle-class neighborhood. It started with anchor stores that were department stores. So you had JC Penny and then Riches, which was later bought by Macy. So you had these two national chains. It had the first Chick-fil-A in a mall, like that type of format. So when you think about the history of malls, like Greenbry had like the perfect template, but now Macy's will be exiting the mall, meaning that the mall will be left without an anchor, which is vital to attracting other shoppers to come into the stores. Greenbryer then because it's kind of an example or a test for all these other middling malls across America about what do you do when these large department stores as a business decision on there and are trying to just stay in the high quality malls, how does a middling mall survive? What's their next strategy? Yeah. Greenbrier is a textbook example of how closely the deterioration of the middle class in the US is tied to the health of its malls. The median income for the surrounding area has reduced by $6,905 over the past 15 years, to a total of $20,756 per year. And yet, residents and store owners hope that Greenbrier mall will see better days. Maws are made up of the people and communities that help fuel them. Greenbrier is still a place that people go to and cherish, even if on paper it doesn't have the elements that make it a thriving mall. A lot of the existing constituents and residents there feel in many respects that they worked hard their whole lives to be able to experience the American dream, the single family suburban house in a leafy yard near a big mall that had a great nieceies. They're very reluctant to see that taken away from them. Now that Macy's is gone, Greenbrier may try to take inspiration from what many malls were doing in the years following the financial crisis, focusing not on shopping, but experiences. That was a trend we were seeing in 2016 up into the pandemic pretty much. And by experiences I mean everything as dramatic as a water park or hosting concerts to have people want to come other than just to buy stuff. Having Instagramable moments, making sure your store is pretty that people want to take a photo and post it on Instagram or Twitter. Historically the mall has always been a place for teenagers. You like to hang out, see your friends and also kind of be seen at the mall and that hasn't completely changed like before the pandemic, about 95% of Gen Z. So today's teenagers had gone to a mall in a three month period. So teenagers are still going to the mall and they've always been key to having thriving malls because they're coming into their spending power and once you win over teens hopefully you're really winning over a loyal customer for life. That thanks to lockdowns across the country, most malls at one point or another were shuttered in 2020. That means no one using the multi billion dollar American Dream malls indoor ski slope. No one going to the King of Prussia malls indoor skydiving attraction. Basically the pandemic game.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,67,2022-11-17 02:37:56
17454," using the multi-billion dollar American Dream mall's indoor ski slope. No one going to the King of Prussia mall's indoor skydiving attraction. Basically, the pandemic gave malls what they didn't need. Another problem. What would your net income or net operating income have been in 2022 without COVID and what is it now in a post-COVID world? So our view is roughly 10% hit to net income over that period. That's Vince Taboni from the analytics from Green Street Advisors, which rates American malls from eight a deed just like a report card. And if malls did have a report card they wouldn't exactly make honor roll. Here in the US, out of the thousand malls in the country there are roughly 250 malls, we grade a minus or better. The DNC quality malls, which is the vast majority of the malls by count, we think are on a negative trajectory and it's going to depend on a lot of the local dynamics, ownership decisions around how much money to invest in the property. We'll determine whether this mall can survive as retail or so, you know, rapidly melting ice cube. While there have been a few bankruptcies among real estate investment trusts that own mostly B2D malls in the past few years, A malls really are doing just fine. Some of the most productive shopping centers in the country are super high-end. So I'm talking about bal harbour shops down in Miami, Florida. There's Americana and Manhattan, asset in Long Island's Gold Coast, the Grove in Los Angeles. These are places that have all high-end stores and have done quite well. A lot of that has to do with efficiency of their properties, so their sales per square foot are really high, but also they've invested a lot in their actual mall because it has to look beautiful. It has to have all the services that a wealthy shopper expects. So what will the future hold for less sought-after malls that can't revive their golden years? For many of these malls, it will mean closure and then hopefully conversion. If they can't get a new use to come in, it's expensive, but you can just demolish it. And there are still quite a lot of sites just sitting waiting. Amazon has been picking up more and more of those building their big fulfillment centers. Also, a lot of communities think this is an opportunity to redevelop, re-enhabit this dead mall. To help that community meet the challenges it was never originally designed for. The number one reuse of an existing mall is as workspace. It's actually pretty easy to just throw some carpeting down, cut a few more windows, and turn it into office space. The number two reuse of malls is either medical, healthcare, or education. Lots of great examples of community colleges all the way down to elementary schools. Moving into malls, then the third strategy that I wish happened more is actually just demolishing the mall and re-grain it. Either reconstructing the wetlands that used to be there and that frankly we never should have built on in the first place or providing community parks and gardens. While most analysts say post-pandemic retail shopping could breathe some life back into the American mall, many are not long for this world. Depending on where you live, it might be time to make one last visit, grab some food, do some shopping, and say farewell.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,68,2022-11-17 02:42:15
17455," So President Trump traveled to Utah today where he dramatically cut back the size of two national monuments in that state. When former President Donald Trump announced plans to scale back two national monuments in Utah, there was outcry from a lot of people. One company in particular. Patagonia really is a resistance brand. They embraced the liberal resistance against President Donald Trump and really put themselves at the forefront of that movement. In 2017, it sued the Trump administration for sort of slashing the size of these two national monuments in Utah that were kind of mechas for climbers. It's said at the time joining the legal fracas was both extraordinary and obvious. The company's general counsel said it took exactly one email to the board to decide to actually do that. That's in the case is still out. Well, I think the only thing this administration understands is lawsuits. We're losing this planet and we have an evil government and I'm not going to stand back and just let evil win. This year it got even more active, it changed its mission statement to quote, Patagonia isn't business to save our home planet and then it manufactured these little tags on some of its clothes that if you flip them up, it says both the assholes out, very implicit, running up to the election and it launched a digital tool to help people find the polling place and on that digital platform, it says both the climate deniers out of office. Again and again on the loop. This isn't the first time that taking a stand has paid off the Patagonia. The business which is now worth over a billion dollars was built on it. I couldn't care less about making more money but by doing the right thing it always ends up making me more money. So is this all a strategy, a sort of premeditated strategy, who knows? I mean, Sean Arts has been very vocal from the start and makes no bones about, he calls himself a dirt bad climber and an accidental entrepreneur. So I don't think he's fudging this but what's important is that it's sort of a textbook marriage of philanthropy and profit. If you want to understand the entrepreneur's study that you and I have the link with, because you know they're saying you know this sucks. And I'm going to do it my own way. Of course, like every other teenage kid I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. When I was 16 years old I took off and drove across the country, went into the Wind River Range and discovered mountains. Patagonia was born out of rock climber Abonchioan Arts first business, Schuwan Art Equipment, which made and sold climbing supplies. Abonchioan Art was...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,69,2022-11-17 02:46:43
17456," Patagonia was born out of rock climber of Bonchium Arts first business, Schuwenart equipment, which made in soul climbing supplies. Yvonne Schonard was a blacksmith in the 50s, and he started selling climbing gear out of the back of his car. That was less harmful to rock faces. This is sort of the origin story of the company. It's called itself the activist company, a activist company. Yvonne Schonard Six months out of the year, Yvonne Schonard is a blacksmith. He makes mountain climbing gear. The other half of the year he climbs. In 1968, Yvonne Schonard and four friends, including Dag Tomkins, the late founders of the North Face brand, embarked on the ultimate road trip from California where they were based to Patagonia in Argentina. The mountain was in a good mood, dazzling sun, calm air all day. If this weather holds, they could be on the summit within days. This trip became a documentary about these friends who were hippies in the 70s climbing in Yosemite where the sport became a lifestyle. And how these friends became pioneer of the outdoor industry. Schonard moved from selling petons to polyester and in the 70s Patagonia was born. In 1973, Schonard and his wife Melinda opened the very first Patagonia store in Ventura, California where the company's headquarters remained today. Melinda Schonard was the driving force behind many of the employee benefits like on-site childcare that helped the company achieve an impressive 4% employee turnover rate. The retail and consumer product sector average is more than triple that at 13%. I do think that Patagonia was a leader, one of the first corporations to take into account, you know, the human capital and make sure that their staff, all their employees were cared for in many ways, not just wages, but also they just cared about their people and knew that that's a good business model. Patagonia began donating 10% of its profits to grassroots organizations in 1985. This later became the 1% of sales that Schonard labels and Earth tax. I don't think it's for land free. It's rent for us living on this planet. While Patagonia was creating the blueprint of how to be a socially conscious brand, it was also turning a profit. It even made ink magazines list of the fastest growing privately held companies. So every time the company makes a decision to do something socially environmentally active, it is met with success and that isn't lost on Schonard or any of the other leaders of the company. The more money Patagonia made, the more it gave away under its philanthropic program. Between 1989 and 1991, the payroll grew by 40%. But trouble was on the horizon. I think for 1991, we are looking at a recession. The question is how deep that recession is going to be and how long will be in it? Sales fell flat and the bank called in the company's revolving loans. The company that prided itself on taking care of its own laid off 120 people, roughly 20% of its workforce. That was when we decided that we were going to start doing things different. And we're going to start running the company as if it's going to be here 100 years ago. With a renewed sense of purpose, Patagonia was ready for what it called business unusual. It started with the costly move to recycle an organic materials before launching a clothing repair service to discourage fast fashion. And Patagonia's influence was growing. What was intended as Schuernard's philosophical handbook for employees became an international blueprint for sustainable business printed in time languages. What's interesting to me is that all this, I hate the term on brand, but it's very on brand. It really works for the kind of company he's created. It works for the kind of employees he's been able to recruit and retain it all.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,70,2022-11-17 02:50:59
17457," Term on brand, but it's very on brand. It really works for the kind of company he's created. It works for the kind of employees he's been able to recruit and retain. It all is very seamless in terms of the identity of him and the company and what it means in the marketplace. So over time, the company's mission and its marketing have become the same thing. The inflection point came in 2011, actually Black Friday, Patagonia took out a huge ad in the New York Times that said, don't buy this jacket. And it sort of got into the mini-gritty on the carbon footprint and the water footprint that goes into a piece of a peril like a parka. And at the time, Seanard said, the best jacket for our planet is one that already exists. So the company at that time said it needed to address the issue of consumerism, which coming from a for-profit business hits pretty hypercritical. As the company encouraged its customers to buy less, its annual sales increased by almost 40%. The stance on this is hypercritical is loud and constant talking about consumerism in a critical light while very much being a part of it. Fast fashion is top on the list of environmental destruction and not just destroying the environment but impacting human health. They are in the fashion industry, they're clothing retailer and to come head to head with that is courageous. You're not only just trying to create a product that'll last but you're also educating an entire generation of people to understand that whole ideology that we don't need to change out our outfits. In 2014, Rose Macario was appointed as CEO. During the next six years, she grew Patagonia into a billion dollar company while also scaling up its environmental goals and bringing a more political voice to its activism. Ivan had this model where he was basically saying you can have a great business, you can make quality product, but you can also do the right thing by the environment, by your employees, by your community. That to me was like the most holistic vision of business that I'd ever seen. So right now Patagonia has a team of about 20 people solely focused on activism and grants. And this all comes at a time in the past decade when consumers are paying much more attention to the social footprint of companies and where they buy their goods. So what's happened is all this is good business for Patagonia in the past 10 years. Revenue and profit at the company of roughly quadruple, it's private but estimates are it does about a billion dollars in annual sales, which is sizable. And that's part of the reason why it's been such a for two-odd cycle as it's ramped up its activism and become more vocal on these things. It's resonated with the market. As the company branched out into other areas including Adventure Capital Fund for Environmental Causes and Sustainable Food, Revenue reached a new peak of over one billion dollars in 2017. But this was still small change compared to fast fashion heavyweights like Nike, who made 37 billion dollars that same year. Patagonia's conscience hasn't always been reflected in its customer base either. Personalized bests have become the go-to corporate uniform and the expensive price tag has helped the brand and the nickname Patagonia. It's expensive stuff, it's expensive apparel and that is part of their calculus in terms of the activism, you know, a lot of the more sustainable parts of the supply chain are there's a premium for organic cotton or sustainable down. The Patagotchi label is a symptom of that. So Patagonia products are very popular of course with people who are active in the outdoors but also with people who are not as active. For instance, you know, people in finance where the Patagonia has to go to the office and that's because of the image that the brand projects and so they have",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,71,2022-11-17 02:55:12
17458," going to finance where the Patagonia vests go to the office. And that's because of the image that the brand projects. And so they have to leave with the fact, although they preach for the environment and want to stand for good, they're victims of their own success. Patagonia set sales records in the first three years of the Trump administration. Now, in 2020, things have changed. Is COVID-19 brought the business world to a halt? And the American people voted in a new administration. Patagonia appointed Brian Gellert as CEO. As far as its CEO transition goes, this one's happening quite strangely. There's no real budget for next year yet because of everything that's going on and all the uncertainty around that. Patagonia's new focus is going to be on forging a relationship with the Biden administration. It should be a more close relationship. But Gellert still has his guard up. During the Obama administration, they didn't always agree and he expects the same with Biden in the White House. They plan to bring litigation wherever needed against any government needed about the issues that they care about and that's climate change in the environment.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,72,2022-11-17 03:00:09
17459," Luge I think you built this. So this is all. This is new since the pandemic. We assume Googlers would want more indoor outdoor options. I mean it's so exciting. It's such a fun. It is. It is. But I would say the thing we're really excited about are these new buildings because we were building sustainability and everything we do. So really forward looking. Good. Okay. From one of the newest workspaces at the Googleplex in Mountain View, California, this is Bloomberg Studio 1.0 with Alphabet CFO, Ruth Porat. We're not far from her childhood home. Her father was a physicist at Stanford, her mother, a psychologist. After graduating from Stanford herself and then earning a couple more advanced degrees, Porat landed her first job on Wall Street in 1987, where she would spend almost three decades until Google's co-founders lured her to Silicon Valley. It's wonderful to be here with you. It's great to have you here at the Googleplex. Thank you for having us. So we are at Google headquarters in Mountain View and at this very same time you are making massive investments in New York Office real estate. You're expanding headcount in Atlanta and Chicago and Washington DC. What's the strategy behind all of this? Well, at the core, we believe in hybrid work. So we do want to bring people back on campuses, but not full time. We're thinking it would probably be a three, two, work week, but we think coming together is just such a core part of innovation, serendipity, culture, every element of it. We're growing at a really rapid clip. So we are excited to be expanding our real estate footprint. And then we also wanted to make sure that we're meeting people where they want to be. And so enlarging the number of sites that we have available for people in particular sites where you have great diverse populations. So we soon are just told me that Googlers will have this option to work in a hybrid mode forever, literally forever. Obviously you're embracing this massive cultural shift, but what are the risks? You know, what are you worried about? So the positive we've seen is there's a productivity uplift. We believe in giving people the opportunity to be at home some of the time, not do the commute, be able to deal with everything else in their life and coming into the office. So the risk is, I think about my career and so much of the benefit in my career was the informal coaching being pot brought into meetings, all of the touch points that you have.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,73,2022-11-17 03:04:05
17460," career and so much of the benefit in my career was the informal coaching being pot-pronented meetings, all of the touch points that you have. And so I think that one of the most important things for all of us as leaders is we need to evolve the way we lead. We need to make sure that we're thinking about this hybrid work life and why that's the way to be the best magnet for talent and make sure that we're continuing to reinforce all of those great practices while opening up new great practices. Speaking of your career before you were CFO of AlphaBat, you were CFO's Morgan Stanley and you started your career on Wall Street in 1987. Talk to us about the journey of going from big banks to big tech. Why did you make that leap and what impact did you want to have? Well I love seeing it work in Stanley and I became CFO the day James Gorman became CFO, yes, needed to join them in that journey and that was January 2010 and we were still recovering coming out of the financial crisis. There were still some pretty rocky days and a lot of decisions that needed to be made and then I got to a point where I felt like we were in a great spot at Morgan Stanley and obviously it's continued to do really well and I just wanted that next chapter. On my view in my career I've always been focused on and I've continually learning and I feel like when you hit a plateau the right questions what's my highest and best use and it's been an extraordinary time. You also survived Wall Street in the 80s and 90s which is notorious Boys Club and Silicon Valley has sort of come to be known as a Boys Club of its own. How would you compare those two cultures? Well when I was starting my career many decades ago it was tough and much worse than it is now and it evolved. No question about it not where it needs to be but certainly evolved and I saw it through my career. I would say the biggest difference out here is the level of impatience and I love it as the view is if you can do some of the extraordinary breakthroughs that we have out here if you can do natural language translation everything we do with AI with VR with self-driving cars why can't you fix this now and that level of impatience I think is fantastic. Legend has it that when you got to Google you were going to rain in the spending tighten up on the moonshots your nickname I believe was Ruth Vader. Was that a tough job to take on? So I think the the narrative was written before I got here and what I find most interesting about that is I firmly believe the single most important thing in capital allocation is investing for long-term growth. I think if you don't you are sowing the seeds of your long-term decline and I learned that really early on in my career now if you're investing in an industry like this and trying to do truly transformative things by definition everything can't succeed and so by definition you should have the metrics and data and milestones to assess is it working or is it not because if everything's working or if you think everything's working I would say one of two things are wrong either you're not reaching high enough or you're not being honest enough with yourself about the pace of breakthrough whether you're going to get there so to me a really natural part you know kind of the sister organization to investing for long-term growth is actually thinking about how are you doing with the risk that you're taking stack rack them and figure out what's at the bottom so you can redeploy those resources to the top they go together actually and so I find the narrative it's a false choice to think that it's either about growth or it's about pruning stack ranking they go together and you have to think of them as actually empowering one another. You advised the Treasury Department during the great recession what lessons did you take away from that? What struck me is a lot of the lessons from the financial crisis are relevant in good times and bad times so the most important is it's easier to prevent than to fix and and so you know there was that was really clear during the financial crisis the financial crisis was about liquidity and it dried up quickly and it would have been really easy six to 12 months prior to build in durable liquidity you couldn't do it in the moment and so this notion about really building a solid foundation on which you operate you need to do that ahead of time it needs to be all of the work we do on trust and",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,74,2022-11-17 03:08:18
17461," and do it in the moment. And so this notion about really building a solid foundation on which you operate, you need to do that ahead of time. It needs to be all of the work we do on trust and safety and content, moderation, security. That is the foundation on which you can build everything else. The hangpaws at one point said to me, you have to have the will and the means. And too often, by the time you have the will, you no longer have the means. His comment was, be decisive, act early, even in the absence of information. I think that's true in this whole notion of investing for long-term growth. Because if you're not actually assessing progress along the way, and you just assume, you know what, we can keep investing in everything. At some point down the road, you'll say, I wish I had made those tough calls to double down on the things that really mattered. What times are we in now? What's your read on the economy today, especially with rising inflation? Well, look, I think back to March of 2020 and where we were. I think of all of the intervention and steps that have been taken since then. You've certainly seen the recovery coming out the back end. It's been really gratifying from those painful days to see the breakthroughs that we've had not just on the medical front, but we've also seen the improvement across businesses. I think one of the biggest concerns in particular, as you're seeing us, go through a digital transformation and the acceleration of it is ensuring that everyone has the skills, the digital training and skills to thrive in this new economy. Google now reaches more than half the people on the planet. Why shouldn't we view Google as a monopoly? We often say that people come to Google not because they have to, but because they want to. We're opening the world for so many people, so that's the intent. I want to talk a little bit about regulation. You were drawn to M&A in your early days at Morgan Stanley. Microsoft is making some big acquisitions, deals that some think Google maybe would have wanted to win in a former life, is antitrust scrutiny constraining any of your business plans, your ability to compete? The main thing that we've done throughout the life of Google is really invest in innovation, its organic growth, and we're continuing to do that at a really rapid clip. We have then layered onto it, tuck in acquisitions and larger acquisitions, and we're continuing to be active, more on the smaller ones and the add-ons to be fair. We think there's a lot of opportunity still ahead of us. We're continuing to invest in partnerships and in some acquisitions, and do you think that there's still upside in a lot of different areas? So would you say this regulatory scrutiny isn't slowing you down? It's really important for those of us in certain leadership positions to be very focused on constructively engaging and working with regulators on what are the issues.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,75,2022-11-17 03:12:46
17462," It's really important for those of us in certain leadership positions to be very focused on constructively engaging and working with regulators on what are the issues, what is it they're trying to solve, and how can we constructively engage with them. At the same time, our engineers should focus on innovation and continuing to kind of up the bar on everything we're doing, address what is most helpful for our users. Google is facing more serious legal threats at this time in the United States than the other big tech companies. How are those conversations with regulators going? Are they frustrating at this point? Well, there's certain elements that are frustrating because I listen to the outline of some of the proposed legislation, and I think it's inconsistent with some of the priorities for public policy. So as an example, there are a lot of focus on what is called self-preferencing. Are you putting too many of your own products together? But during the pandemic, one in three small businesses said they would have failed without digital skills. Why? Because what they were able to do is connect with their users in different ways. So if you go search for a small business, you can then go to a map and you can get directed to the small business, that's a good thing. We have 6,000 small businesses who wrote in and said, you know what, we need these digital tools and skills. Same with a number of things on racial equity. Real surge in searches about where can I, where's a black owned business near me, and the ability to direct people through search and maps. So I think that what's really important, and that's why I said it's about constructive engagement, let's make sure we understand what they're trying to solve and work with them on what is it that we're trying to address through products so that the products are helpful in the ways that they want. Facebook has taken a serious reputational hit. Has that had ripple effects or created collateral damage for Google? Well, I think that whenever there's a backdrop that's challenging, it has ripple effects. But what we're really underscoring is all of the steps and investments that we are making to really protect the ecosystem the way we are commitment to our users. So we know how sacrosanct that trust is and it's all about privacy and what are the steps that we're taking to make. Privacy could protect it for our users. What is it that we're looking at to protect content and content moderations? Google now reaches more than half the people on the planet. Why shouldn't we view Google as a monopoly? So, you know, I go back to the earliest days when Google, I first learned about Google back in 1998. And in those earliest days, when I heard about this like eighth search engine, the question is why do you actually need it? And back at Morgan Stanley, it's working with our research analyst Mary Meeker, she actually had her team put up white pages all around the conference room and was doing this comparison. Well, provided the most responsive results most rapidly. And all of a sudden, you could see, well, when did this Google thing actually maybe we do need something new? And that's been the ethos at Google since inception. It's just continued to innovate to make this eight and ever better experience for users. And so if we can, if we can deliver on that, which is what drives people here, it's really opening the world for so many people. So that's the intent. Facebook and Twitter are exploring digital currency. What is your thought on the crypto market? And is there a play for Google? So we look at it. There's nothing to comment on now. I think we're much more interested in blockchain and the underlying technology and the implications for the business and also for the way we can support our cloud customers. So certainly a lot of effort there. There's considerable chatter in the crypto universe that Web 3 and the blockchain could circumvent the power of Facebook and Google and more. What do you think about the next frontier of the internet? At this point, I think there are a lot of different things ahead of us that are actually studyingly exciting that enable us to actually continue to address different needs and requirements. Like I look at, for example, in something like health where I think blockchain will be very valuable when you think about health and health records, there's also a whole host of other areas where the data analytics that we provide are absolutely critical.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,76,2022-11-17 03:17:04
17463," Areas where the data analytics that we provide are absolutely critical. Should we make excuses to our employers? Should we tell our like, if I have to head to a parent's teacher conference or take a kid to the doctor, do I tell my boss that I want to? You don't tell your boss. You've got to get over the guilt. What was your biggest fear at that time and how did you overcome it? Well the biggest fear was I wouldn't make it and I remember when someone at some interview while I was going through chemo said, where do you want to be in five years and I froze? It was I want to be alive. And I learned a couple of really important things. One, given breakthroughs in medical technology, I learned to love the word manageable. This journey does become manageable, not for all cancers, but for many more cancers. And that gave me a lot of confidence talking with other survivors about it is manageable, get the best care. And just plow through it. I was just very grateful. I'm grateful for all of the investments people have made over the years, but for anybody out there and I think everybody sadly will be touched by cancer either themselves or someone they know and love, many of these cancers are manageable and just go at it with gusto. So that's what I did. You're a mom of three sons and I find that especially remarkable because I also have three sons. How have you managed that over the course of this incredible career? How do you find that right mix of focus and free time to spend time with your family and doing the things that you love? Oh my kids give me energy, they're remarkable. And I think one of the important things for me is this notion that you do have to have a mix. It's not about trying to find balance, the physics of which is really challenging. I think when people try for balance, they always feel they're failing on something because something's out of whack. So this metaphor that life is like a kaleidoscope and you need to have different shaped pieces of glass and different color and sometimes one is larger than the other and what's beautiful about life is when it's constantly moving around. And so to me that metaphor has actually been sort of an anchoring principle. The other is you have to put the kids first. So like they know that I'm there when they need always. And I think that just making sure that you're setting the boundaries the way you need to, I would say it's much easier today than when I was growing up in banking. We had a cubicle, there was a computer room, you were anchored to the computer room.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,77,2022-11-17 03:21:31
17464," You need to. I would say it's much easier today than when I was growing up in banking. You know, we had a cubicle. There was a computer room, you were anchored to the computer room. One of the many beautiful things about going through this evolution in work is understanding that hybrid works. So how do we get rid of mom guilt? Especially in this new work world. I want to shake my mom guilt. How do I do that? Okay, so even when you feel it, just say, you know what, it's an investment in my career because I can stay in this longer and be operating at a higher level. If I'm really getting the stimulus from all parts of my life. So you've got to drop the mom guilt and when on the other side mom guilt with kids, I think they get it. I think they understand what we're doing. And you know, they'll never forget during the financial crisis at one point I was working on AIG. We went around the clock. I came home to shower that one like right as we were landing AIG and my three kids had each written me a yellow sticky note with a message on it. And one of them was based, you know, the essence of which was, I get why you're doing this. And they saw it as the right thing for the country. I don't need to over dramatize what it was, but that's what it felt like at the time. And that level of pride, I still have those three stickies right by my bedside because I get it. I get the mom guilt. I wish there were certain elements I could have done differently. But I also see the relationship we have and they understand what it means to actually be engaged in society and doing something you care about. No mom guilt. No mom guilt. Thank you. It's not allowed. Should we make excuses to our employers? Should we tell our like, if I have to head to a parent teacher conference or take a kid to the doctor, do I tell my boss that you don't tell your boss? You don't tell your boss. Guys don't tell their boss. So what do we say? I don't think you say anything. I actually made this point at an event at Morgan Stanley. I'm like, do not tell your boss. You've got to get over the guilt. The only way to move on from it is realize I'm a professional. I do things when I, when I can. And it makes sense and I get it all done. I just do it on my own timeline. And I actually had a woman who emailed me afterwards and said, I know you said I'm not supposed to tell my boss. So I won't. But I can't not tell somebody. So I'm going to email you. And I'm like, okay, that's step one. I'm on five step journey. Do not tell your boss. Tell your boss, you know what? I need to do certain things for myself. And I'm getting, I feel guilty doing it. But I get everything done. There's no question you are so beyond having to check in with people. Well, thank you. So not. We're in the middle of this so-called great resignation. And people are reflecting and changing and making big decisions. What's your advice to people in this big evolution? You know, huge choices ahead. Well, I think you framed it really well. I don't think it's the great resignation. I think it's the great reshuffle. And people are reflecting on what do they want? And how do they want to work? And how do they want to live their lives? So I think for all of us thinking about what does that mean for our institutions? It is about evolving the way we work, the way we interact, the expectations that we have. To say, but I grew up in a cubicle on the 26th floor of a skyrise. It doesn't work anymore. And so what should we do as leaders? And I think that our, this generation appropriately, and it's very exciting, expects more from all of us. And so it's not just in how we work, but it is in what we do. And I think all elements of what's the mission? Are you delivering on the mission? Is really important. Okay, so if you rapid fire questions, someone you'd love to have dinner with? Oh, well, I'd love to say my parents because they passed away in over a years ago. Favorite family ritual? We do this crazy thing that we've done for years, which is everybody gets to pick where we travel. We come up with the five different locations and then we all vote and then we get the grid. And that's where we go. What's your favorite getaway? Probably, I would say maybe Iceland was the vast. That's an amazing one. New York or California? Ooh, so unfair. Well, sitting here outdoors right now and knowing I can do that for the rest of the years for you guys for the energy from New York. So I'm not going to, it's like my, I don't pick amongst children. So, in closing, Google's a massive company, multiple divisions, many beds. Where?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,78,2022-11-17 03:25:50
17465," Rest of the year is pretty nice, but the energy from New York, so I'm not going to, it's like, I don't pick amongst children. So, in closing, Google is a massive company, multiple divisions, many bets. Where are you spending most of your time now? I'm spending most of my time on your very important question about capital allocation, because if it really goes to this core point, you've got to invest for long term growth and making sure that you're investing with the right intensity, I often say, I don't want to get to the two-yard line but not score. So, you need to make sure you're investing with the right intensity to support long term growth. That's the most important area where I would say I spend the bulk of my time. And then, of course, you have to prioritize in order to recycle to support those efforts. What kind of discussions are you having with Larry and Sergey now about this next phase of Google? So, when they made the announcement about the role of change, they were very serious about moving to this board role, and they're amazing board members. Sundar, of course, relies on them for council wherever, whenever. But most of the interaction is really around what are we doing at the board level? It's been great. And you have your freedom to allocate capital as you like. I work closely with Sundar and Phillip and Thomas. Yes, we work as a great team. So, what's the vision for Google then, 10 years from now? You know, it's fascinating to... I think I had the same reaction you did when I heard Sundar say search is the biggest moonshot. And I think that continuing to find ways to be helpful to users, to solve what they need where, so many people are coming online, and it is video going to be the way they understand it's going to be about... Search is going to be a different type of experience, so much of it's going to be about voice, first, and language translation. So, it's going to continue to evolve. And what about for you personally? Where will you... It's been so amazing to hear about your journey, and I'm just curious about your personal growth. What you feel you've accomplished in the last, since you've been here, and what you hope to accomplish. I find that the opportunity to try new things and to invest in new things, and as we think about, well, what does that mean for each one of our areas? I think that intellectual curiosity keeps you young, and I think that continuing to learn is like your brain, is like silly putty getting pulled in a lot of directions. So, to me, it's continuous learning. Ruth Porat, thank you so much for joining us. It's been wonderful to be here. Thank you. Great to have you on campus. Come back anytime. Thank you so much for doing this. Thanks for doing it. Sorry I'm late and I'm kind of late. Not at all. It gave us more chance to tweak the lights for the 50,000th time. You're doing well? Yes.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,79,2022-11-17 03:30:15
17466," William late and not coming late, but not at all. It gave us more chance to tweak the lights for the 50,000s times. You're doing well? Yes. How often are you coming into the office these days? About two to three days a week. Yeah. How about you? I guess you come in. Yeah, I'm in every day now. So no more kids on the set. I have to ask, is your son still mining Ethereum? He and I literally were talking about it last night. He's like, that you are the one who made me give up on it. I'm like, no, I didn't. But yeah, the thing that's good about this is I think it excites a whole new generation about technology, which is good. I really appreciate you taking this time. Well, thank you for doing it and thank you for coming down to do it. I'm ready to go when you guys are. From Google headquarters in Mountain View, California, this is Bloomberg Studio 1.0 with Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai. Born and raised in India, Pichai had almost no access to a computer until college. But just years later, found himself rising through the ranks of the world's largest search engine. In 2015, it was Pichai that Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Bryn chose to run Google and later Alphabet. Now valued at more than $2 trillion, it's one of the most powerful companies on the planet. Sundar, it's great to be with you today. Thanks for doing this. Great to be here in person. Google just hit a $2 trillion market cap. Alphabet, I should say. Where is the next trillion dollars going to come from? You know, I've always felt, you know, your market cap valuation is an effect of the value you provide. And I feel fortunate. Our mission is timeless. You know, there is more need to organize information than ever before. I still feel searches are biggest moonshaws as a company. You know, people will want radically more conversational experiences. They will want what we call multimodal experiences. They may speak to search. They may look at something and ask what the information is. Being able to adapt to all that and evolve search will continue to be the biggest opportunity. We are so excited about the YouTube cloud or hardware products. Google Play. So we're building a diverse set of businesses. But an underlying all of it is the investments we are making in AI. You know, we've invested $100 billion in R&D in the past five years. And so applying AI in a deep way is probably where we will create the biggest opportunity ahead. Microsoft is making some big acquisitions. Apple's anti-adtracking technology is shaking up the industry. What do you make of these competitive moves? Your competitors say they're on the right side of history. Are they? I look at the fact that there are three billion people who have access to knowledge of their fingertips. I look at the opportunity we provide. I look at the skills people are learning through YouTube. You know, I feel it everywhere when I go talk to people. And providing access to information and knowledge. I think we'll end up being on the right side of history as well. Your predecessor, Eric Schmidt, told me that he feels the latest Facebook revelations are disturbing. Google also has access to massive amounts of our data. Why should half the world's population, more than half the world's population, trust Google to do the right thing? We are trying to do more with less data. One of the biggest changes we made was making auto-delete the default setting for new users signing in. And now, over two billion users have their data continuously being deleted. Look, we rely on trust for people. You know, every day when people come to Google, you know, they place their trust to us in vulnerable moments. Maybe a healthy shoe on which they are trying to understand. You know, there's no more important responsibility we have than doing right by that trust. You know, when we provide Gmail to journalists and realize that their accounts may be under attack by an authoritarian government, I mean, that's what motivates us to make sure be privacy, be security, be trust.

17467," We are doing the right thing. Over time regulation will have an important role to play here. I think privacy regulation is important. In areas like AI regulation will be important. And so I think those who will be part of the answers as well. The Facebook follow out, that Instagram can be toxic to teens, for example, has this raised more or new concerns for you about the impact of technology, tech addiction, algorithms, YouTube even, on our children and their development and their mental health. When you're a parent, and you also have a lot of power over how this plays out. You know, I mean, like you, bringing kids up in this modern digital world is something I think all parents are anxious about rightfully so. I think it's part of why a few years ago when in YouTube, we were exposed to a set of concerns. We invested. It became our number one priority to work harder to work harder. The reason YouTube invested so much in developing YouTube kids as a safe destination for young children, so on. Technology is going to play a big role in helping give children the next wave of opportunity as well. So the answer is to develop it responsibly. We have changed our balance in these areas and saying, we think about content responsibility first, and then the pace of development for new features approach it for a while. Facebook and Microsoft are all in on the metaverse. What do you think about the metaverse? What's Google's metaverse strategy? It's always been obvious to me that computing over time will adapt to people and people adapting to computers. You won't always interact with computing in a black rectangle in front of you. So just like you speak to people, you see and interact. Computers will become more immersive. They'll be there when you need it to be. So it's always been excited about the future of immersive computing and being computing AR. And we are in that count as the metaverse. Is that what that is? You know, metaverse is, I think it means different things to different people. The way I think about it is evolving computing in an immersive way with augmented reality. As part of that, there'll be many experiences. Some of which will be immersive, interactive virtual worlds, which is the metaverse concept. And I think this doesn't belong to any company. This is the evolution of internet and the web, the internet, all of it will continue to evolve. Google was famous for its campuses, where you could go and never leave. You had everything you ever wanted. Now you've said they can be flexible. They can work from home. They can work at the office. They can be hybrid. They can work remotely, permanently perhaps. Are you committed to really letting them do this forever? And if so, how does that change the future of work and society? Look, we have really embraced the fact that the future is going to be flexible. At Google, we've always tried to give agency to our employees. But we do realize the importance of bringing people together the creativity, community, and collaboration that comes with it. So the balance we are striking is this notion of 3.2. And what we are giving, the strength of our company is we have more locations than most of the companies. So we're giving people a choice to move anywhere in the world. Four weeks they can work from anywhere. We're going to accommodate 20% of our workforce to be remote over time. So we're going to embrace that flexibility. Forever. Forever. Yeah. And we're committed to it. Through it all, it forces us to design better products. And since people use Google Workspace to run their companies, I think gives us a chance to innovate and bring all that out. I think there is so much value in giving people more flexibility between their personal and professional lives. And I think it will lead to people being happier. And I think companies can be successful in that model. And so we are trying to get the best of both worlds, but embrace the flexibility and see where we go. How confident are you that when you look back, you'll be able to say Google did enough to help save the world? We are putting so much energy and resource into it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,81,2022-11-17 03:38:48

We are putting so much energy into it. We are putting so much energy into it. You grew up in India, you lived through droughts, water was scare. How has that experience shaped your feelings about the urgency of stopping climate change? I grew up in Chennai, India and a big part of my childhood was a really pretty severe water scarcity. We would get water trapped in for the streets and stand in lines and carry a few buckets of water at home. I had a few years ago, Chennai had 100-year flood, which was an extremely dreamy moment. I was so excited to see my children's faces and explain it to everyone in my life. I remember waking up to those orange skies too and having to have that same conversation with my kids. Do you think the commitments at COP26 went far enough? We have to tip our hat to the people who are working super hard. You have to keep the economy growing. I can see the progress. Google has set some aggressive targets to run entirely on clean energy to be the first tech giant to do so 24 hours a day. We are putting so much energy into it. We have set our goals to be 100% by 2030. We have to solve the new things we haven't done.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,82,2022-11-17 03:43:00
17469," The number is now 67%. We have set our goals to be 100% by 2030. And to do it globally, that means we have to solve the new things which we haven't done before. Wind and solar alone won't be enough. We just started geothermal in Nevada. We will be investing in newer technologies, including carbon capture, et cetera, over time. So that's what excites me. We are a technology company at heart. So part of there are many answers to this problem. Some of it is that we are going to have to innovate our way out of it. And we want to push as hard as possible in doing that. Our Bloomberg New Economy Forum is happening this year in Singapore. And the Asia Pacific region is one of the fastest growing internet economies on the planet. Where do you see the most room, the most opportunity for Google to grow there? It's such a fitting time frame. Glad you're focused on the region. It's the most vibrant region we see. It's our 20th year, since we opened our office in Tokyo. It was the first office outside the Bay Area. You have two and a half billion people on the internet. There are many areas in which they are leapfrogging trends which are here and embracing the future. Digital payments is a great example. So many of our products originated from APAC, Google Maps, Google Pay. A lot of our journey to bring computing to more people is playing out in Asia as well. I am excited about also the work we are doing through cloud because the companies that are rapidly transforming themselves digitally. So a chance to provide that is something very exciting for us. So super dynamic region. I feel like we are learning as Google being in the region. And so I think it will transform. The first 10 years I would have said we took products here and brought it to APAC. Or the past few years, we are beginning to build things there. And some of our future global products will be APAC first and rest of the world later. You can't talk about APAC without talking about China. And you're facing stiff competition from Chinese tech giants there and beyond. What should US policymakers know about competing with China? There's a lot of conversations about US and China. The competition is fierce. When you look at areas like AI and quantum computing, where we are investing a lot, Chinese companies are neck to neck. What I think about was encouraged by the news coming out of Glasgow, what the US-China agreement on climate. To me, while we talk about all the areas where we are competing, some of the biggest areas which are common challenges for all of humanity, the pandemic was one. AI and safety over time will be a shared one, obviously sustainability is another area like that. So I think these are all areas in which the countries can come together. And so I think that's a way by which we think about as when we compete on the internet and there may be different versions of how the internet plays out. So I see opportunities both sides. What are the chances that Google search will ever come back to China? Or that Google Cloud would ever come to China? Today we don't provide most of our signs in services in China. And I don't see that changing. But there are ways, as I said, in areas like AI or sustainability. I think there'll be opportunities for us to work together. Through Cloud, we will support multinational companies which have presents everywhere. And so maybe there are opportunities to work that way as well. AI is advancing at an astonishing rate. And it is hard to understand sometimes what this really means. In concrete terms, how will our lives look different? Let's say 10 years from now as a result of AI. You know, done correctly. In many ways, it's going to be helpful to you. You'll take it for granted. The same way today, for example, in India, over one-third of the queries on many phones come through voice. But it's something people take for granted. You can do it. So over time, you'll expect to speak and be able to understand any language in the world. And those are all ways it's going to make it better. You may go to a doctor's office and go through a scan. And the system may be prioritizing for the radiologist.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,83,2022-11-17 03:47:26
17470," get better. You may go to a doctor's office and go through a scan and the system may be prioritizing for the radiologist so that they don't miss some important things, maybe giving them a second opinion. So these are all ways in which it will seamlessly start playing a role, and I think we'll see that if it's a fact. You mentioned if done correctly, and there are concerns, there are fears that AI will replicate the worst of society, even under Google's own roof from your own researchers. What scares you most about AI? What keeps you up at night? It's the most profound thing we are working on as humanity, and anytime you're developing technology there is a dual site to it. I think the journey of humanity is harnessing the benefits while minimizing the downsides. The good thing with AI is it's both going to take time. I think I've seen more focus on the downsides early on than most of the technology we've developed. So in some ways, I'm encouraged by how much concern there is, and you're right, even within Google, people think about it deeply, we publish a lot of research. I think it's more important that there are outside academic institutions, governments, nonprofits looking at this issue as well. So I think it'll be an issue which will have a lot of attention, which gives me a lot of comfort as well. You said you'd pick up some new hobbies in the pandemic. What did you start? The cooking pizza is learning cook, which I was never good at. I'm caught on a little bit better. You have presided over Google through massive social movements that reverberated in and outside the company. What have you learned as CEO since the walkout? For me, it was a moment. I think it changed the company for the better. We've always been committed. It gave us an insight on what more we could do. We undertook deep commitments. The biggest overall and diversity and inclusion, I think, if you're committed and you actually put in the effort behind it, you can make a difference. Now we have stated clear goals. We are on track to meet those goals. But it forced us to think about new answers. For example, tech companies used to talk about the pipeline problem. But we are now going to places where the talent is. We are working much harder. We are going to Atlanta, DC, Chicago, New York. That's improving our diversity and representation at all levels. The war for talent is even more competitive now in this new world. What are you offering? Elon Musk has said, big tech is a place where talent goes to die. How do you-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,84,2022-11-17 03:51:49
17471," All levels. The war for talent is even more competitive now in this new world. What are you offering? Elon Musk has said, big tech is a place where talent goes to die. How do you respond to that? Okay, I look at the fact that, you know, we are looking to hire 30,000 people next year. I look at the impact we have on many people coming and working in the latest cutting edge things. And many people come and people leave Google. We are proud of people who have left Google that are, I think there are over 2,000 companies that have been started by whom we call as Zooklers. I'm equally proud of that, right? I think we are one part of a big system. And, you know, I think I think I'm proud of the role we play in bringing in people and the impact they have over time in the outside world. All right, that's most of the heavy stuff out of the way. We're going to do some rapid fire just to get to know you a little bit better. You said you'd pick up some new hobbies in the pandemic. What did you start? Hi, you know, pizza, cooking pizza, just learning to cook, which I was never good at. I've got on a little bit better. Cricket or soccer slash football? Wow, stuff. Both. Please don't make the quiz. Okay, squid game or Ted Lasso? I watched both. The Ted Lasso is much more calming. And so I'd rather take Ted Lasso over to the games any day. I know you're a voracious reader. So what's the last good book that you read? You know, I've been on a podcast bench. So a lot more podcasts than books nowadays. Okay, favorite videos you watch on YouTube with your kids. A lot of music videos, music videos. This whole notion where creators are watching other things and commenting on it. It's a trend which my kids are really into. And I've kind of gotten used to it now. So, you know, watching other games, it's a phenomenon. Screen time policy that's worked for you as a parent. And what's what's not worked? You know, I've kind of given agency to my kids. The only thing I tell them is that I can look at their digital well-being once in a while with them. And so... How do you do that? I asked them to show it to me and they show it on their phones. So, you know, so that's pretty much the only thing. So beyond that, you know, it's agency and and you know, talking to them about it and making sure we are spending time doing other things. And making sure they develop good habits, basically. That's right. Metaverse or real world? Done correctly. You know, you shouldn't feel and feel the need to make a choice. You know, you always want to be present in the real world. And when you feel the need to do something, you want to do that. But, you know, I do think presence and the realness of the real world will end up mapping for humans for a long time. Do you own any crypto? I wish I did. I've dabbled in it, but you know, in and out. In and out. Okay. Larry and Sergey, I'm not going to make you choose. How many times a week do you talk to them? I talk to them regularly. You know, it kind of ebbs and flows. You know, and so there are times we get excited about something and we spend a lot of time talking it through, but it depends on, you know, what I need. A piece of advice you wish you had in your 20s and a piece of advice you wish you had in your 40s. 20s would be, you know, being patient. You know, I think when you're young, you're very impatient, which is a great thing. But sometimes you do amazing things by slowing down and being really focused and doing it over a period of time. And so I would advise the young, you know, the younger version of me to be more patient. Maybe at 40, I would say, you know, when I look at climate, you know, I want all of us to be impatient. So, you know, I feel like when there's an urgency towards something, I think the world needs to be impatient. So that's the advice I would give to a older version of me. How much do you personally wrestle with the decisions that you have to make? And how much longer do you see yourself being the CEO of Alphabet? Not just Alphabet, but also Google? Yeah. On the first one, there are moments we all have to make tough decisions and, you know, and some decisions weigh on me. But it's a privilege to do it. I have very good people helping me think things through. So I think the combination makes it all, you know, fine.

I didn't have much access to computing growing up. It changed my life a lot. The one laptop or child goal really motivated me to come into technology. And and when I look at last week, us launching a affordable smartphone in India, the chance to bring the next billion users in Asia and in Africa online. That gives me a lot of energy.

17473,"<|pl|><|translate|>ed Jeff Bezos shocked the world when he stepped down a CEO of Amazon. Less shocking was his choice for successor. Annie Jassy was not only one of his longest tenured lieutenants, but the architect of Amazon's multi-billion dollar cloud business, Amazon Web Services, a moonshot that helped transform Amazon into not just e-commerce, but enterprise juggernaut. Jassy then needed to find his own successor, tapping a former colleague who helped grow AWS in its earliest days, but had since left to run Seattle software giant Tableau. His job to continue the reinvention of AWS and in turn, Amazon. Joining me on this edition of Bloomberg Studio 1.0, new AWS CEO, Adam Salipski. You worked for AWS for 11 years and then went on to become CEO of Tableau Software in 2016. Then you get a call from Amazon to come back and run AWS as CEO. Tell me about that call. Well, I was having a one-on-one at my prior company and my Apple news alerts went off like everybody else's did. It's at Jeff Bezos, who's taking on a new role and Andy Jassy's taking on the CEO role of Amazon. Of course, Andy and I worked shoulder to shoulder about 20 feet apart for 11 years. So of course, I reached out and congratulated him and we started talking. You know, the conversation turned to some of the possibilities and next thing I know a little while later. Here I am back at Amazon, absolutely delighted and honored to be the CEO of AWS and helping to shepherd this amazing business for our customers. In that process, did you talk to Jeff as well? Yeah, I had some communication, but it was principally with Andy, who of course was new to AWS business best and of course was taking on the CEO role. But yeah, there was contact as you might expect with a small handful of other people. So what did Andy tell you he wanted in the next chapter for AWS? Andy reminded me, nothing I needed reminding, but that it has really still day one for AWS and for our customers. It is still so early in this business and we shouldn't think that just because the business has grown rapidly or just because we're currently the leader in the cloud, that it's anything close to mature. And so he really reminded me that we have to stay hungry, innovate as quickly as we ever have done in the past. You're about half a year into the job. What changed while you were gone that surprised you? Well, I think that so many more customers have really adopted the cloud and really decided that they're going all in. So I mean, it was a pretty decent sized business when I left, but it's...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,87,2022-11-17 04:05:00
17474," So many more customers have adopted the cloud and really decided that they're going all in. So I mean, it was a pretty decent sized business one I left, but it's really grown and the customer base is really expanded. And so now we have very deep relationships at the CEO level, the CIO level across every country, every industry, every use case. And we're regularly interacting with the most senior people at our client organizations. So you were working at real networks in the early 2000s and I understand you were offered a job at AWS without even really knowing what it was. I guess AWS was in stealth mode. Well, it was very secret. So it was it was it was hard that the company didn't want to talk too much about it. But of course, you know, we had to talk a certain amount about it. So the call I got went something like we have this initiative to turn the guts of Amazon inside out and expose it to other people. And it sounded intriguing, although I confess I didn't fully understand what that was all about. So I came in and started talking to Andy and a few of the other senior leaders and eventually to Jeff. And I would have to say that even by the time I took the job, I thought I mostly understand what they're talking about. And it sounds like a good idea and I'm in, but I also was like, well, you know, we'll just have to see how it goes and, and, you know, Amazon's a big, big place. And so I think we got a lot of a lot of intent to succeed here. And that's the thing that impressed me was Amazon really had the desire and the intent and the belief that this could be a really good business. AWS comes out of stealth mode and is the first to market with a cloud infrastructure service in 2006. How important was that first start and do you think AWS still has an advantage today because of that? I think the the time to market advantage that we had, which was probably honestly five to seven years. Head start before other companies really started to take this seriously was an enormous. Frankly, it was just one of the biggest things that happened to us in the early years. Because at the beginning, a lot of people didn't get it. I would get asked a lot in 2006. So what does this have to do with selling books? And I mean, I even had a slide with kind of a pilot books on it and a question mark next to it. And the answer was it has nothing to do with selling books, but the technology which enables us to sell books, being global, being at a massive scale, being secure, being low cost, being highly performant. All that technology has everything to do with offering these types of services externally. Now AWS isn't a scrappy startup anymore and you do have big rivals, even though AWS is still the leader. Microsoft and Google are big rivals. How do you make sure that being big doesn't slow you down? It's a great question. We are currently the leader and I mean, depending on which third party you look at, we're probably a little bit more than twice as big as number two. And it's really important to continue to act as if we're insurgents and to be insurgents and not to start to act like incumbents. And I like to talk about actually managing the business. We want our senior leaders to be managing product and managing customers. And I think as you get bigger and you put more and more layers into your company, it's all too frequent that you start managing math. You start managing ratios and percentages and growth. And I think it's a real disease if you stray away from really focusing at a deep way on the product you're building, and at a deep way on what your customers are telling you. And so we try and organize both with our org structure as well as just with our culture and what we choose to focus on, on really making sure that everybody is thinking about one or both of those two things, product and customers. And if you keep even the most senior leaders engaged at that level, then all of a sudden you maintain the urgency. And you keep acting like an insurgent. We got to feel that urgency every day. So keep acting like an insurgent. That's the motto. Absolutely. And structure yourself and build a culture that allows you to. It's one thing to say it, but it's easy to say it, but it's much harder to put in place enabling mechanisms that enable you to do so. And we focus a lot of effort on those mechanisms. Now, do you think the cloud keeps getting bigger? And that AWS and Microsoft and Google just get bigger pieces of an ever-expanding pie? Or at some point, does it become a zero-sum game? And...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,88,2022-11-17 04:09:15
17475," Do you think the cloud keeps getting bigger? And that AWS and Microsoft and Google just get bigger pieces of an ever-expanding pie? Or at some point, does it become a zero-sum game? And that fight for market share becomes more brutal and more bloody? Well, I mean, this is a very large market segment. If you look at global IT spend, it's in the trillions of dollars. I've seen estimates like $3 trillion. It doesn't really matter how many trillions it is. It's very, very large. And we've always believed that this was too good a market segment opportunity for there really to only be one winner. And sure enough, you've seen robust competition emerge, and we all compete vigorously. But it is, the segment is just growing so rapidly that I think really for us, we believe that the winning business strategy for a long time to come, and I would maintain forever, is to focus not on the competitors, but to focus maniacally on customers and wake up every day understanding exactly what it is that they need us to build next, and then work backwards from there, back internally to how can we build those things. And if we do the best job at building the most quickly, the things that are most important for our customers, then I'm really not worried about what the competitors will do. You worked 10 feet away from Andy Jassy in the early days. Tell us something about the Amazon CEO that no one knows, but you. You're going to get me in trouble aren't you? I'm going to get you in trouble aren't you? I'm going to get you in trouble aren't you? I'm going to get you in trouble aren't you? I'm going to get you in trouble aren't you? I'm going to get you in trouble aren't you? I grew up in Seattle and Andy coming from New York has this fascination I don't understand with New York sports teams. I've had to endure that for a lot of years. New Yorkers. I think come to adopt some of Seattle teams, particularly the new hockey team, the Kraken here. How do you expect Andy will be different from Jeff? We're all different as leaders. It's important that we all bring our own stamp to it and operate within ourselves. I don't think I would be a very good Andy. I don't want to presume that Andy wouldn't be a great Jeff. Jeff is Andy's Andy and I'm me. Andy was certainly bringing a great depth of experience from AWS, which is one important part of the business and we'll have that business for so long. I expect that will also give them enough.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,89,2022-11-17 04:13:24
17476," of experience from AWS, which is one important part of the business, and we'll have operated that business for so long. And I expect that it'll also give them an opportunity, although he was involved in other parts of Amazon, certainly for a number of years, we'll be able to bring a fresh perspective to the whole company, just as I hope to bring to AWS. And I think that fresh perspective is often helpful, I think, just the mere act of change is useful for the business, for customers, for employees, and just to shake things up a little bit. So I think just a fresh perspective. How will you be different from Andy? Well, I think that the world around us is changing so much that we're going to have to be different. It doesn't matter what we did yesterday. And right after I joined, we actually added two new leadership principles, which is very exciting. One's around striving to be Earth's best employer, and the second around focusing on the fact that success and scale bring broad responsibility. And those are things about which I personally am very passionate. And so I really personally look forward to digging in and helping the company to figure out what are those things that we have to figure out? Where can we innovate to be Earth's best employer? And then also to figure out externally, what can we do to really be great citizens of our local communities, to be great citizens of our national communities, and to be great citizens of the global community? And I care a lot about those things, as a lot of other people do here, but I plan to put a good amount of energy and time and focus and hopefully help Amazon innovate in all of those areas. How closely do you work with Andy Day-to-Day? Does he regularly weigh in on AWS decisions or not? Well, he's got a pretty broad scope of things to worry about now, so he's got a pretty intense day job, I believe. So he's really focused across the company as you would expect him to be. But that being said, obviously, AWS remains an important part of Amazon. And so we touch base regularly, be it in person or via email, just on the most important things going on in the business. Does Jeff ever weigh in on AWS decisions? Yes, I mean, really from the beginning, Jeff was involved at the very, very beginning at some of the most fundamental decisions. How do you price EC2? What do you name? S3? What does the detail page look like? Obviously, over time, the business grew. But Jeff was always available when we needed him. And I certainly anticipate that'll be the same going forward. So is he still available now? And what do you understand that Jeff's priorities are? Sure. Well, I'll let Jeff speak to his own priorities, but certainly, Jeff has been available when, for example, we've been doing our annual planning cycle as many companies have. And it's been great to have Jeff weigh in on really where we're heading for the next year and beyond and to just make sure it's easy to get focused on the details of the business. And it's great to have multiple people who can help you pick your eyes up a little bit. Now, you joined AWS in the middle of a pandemic. You came back to AWS in the middle of a pandemic. That's hopefully moving into the rear view mirror. Moderna is one of AWS's biggest customers. If it weren't for the cloud, if it weren't for AWS, would we have had a vaccine as quickly as we did? I've got to tell you, I'm Iuse, but it's been an absolute privilege for us to work with Moderna because what they're doing, obviously, is literally life-saving. And they've been so innovative and so creative. So Moderna took a drug development process to get to a vaccine candidate. That process would typically have taken them 20 months. And doing that on AWS in conjunction with all the innovation on their side reduced that 20 months to 42 days, 42 days to get the vaccine candidate, the mRNA vaccine candidate for COVID-19. And those really running on, running multiple parts of Moderna on AWS. So if you look at the drug design part, they had their drug design studio running on AWS, all the way to manufacturing with the new digitized manufacturing that they call their digital manufacturing platform. So it's really end to end and the ability to use massive amounts of resources and to pick the exact type of service and capability for each part of the job. And truly...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,90,2022-11-17 04:17:47
17477," to use massive amounts of resources and to pick the exact type of service and capability for each part of the job and to really bring the full set of resources to bear. In addition to not having to focus on the IT and the infrastructure and the technology, and rather letting Moderna focus on the all-important job of drug discovery. So working in partnership, it was just magnificent to see what they accomplished. Since you joined AWS, a number of longtime AWS leaders have moved on to Microsoft, to Stripe, to Tableau, does that concern you? Well, actually retention has been very good. If you mentioned the senior leaders, if you look at the VP Plus ranks, the VP and above ranks at Amazon, the average tenure is over a decade, over 10 years. So that's actually very, very strong retention. So of course, you're always going to have some level of people coming and people going. And at the end of the day, that's actually healthy for the business. You want new perspectives to come in. Of course, in the right proportion. Amazon has opened an investigation after 550 employees supported a petition, claiming a culture of discrimination, harassment, bullying, and bias. What's the status of this? Well, we are incredibly focused, and I personally believe it's incredibly important to really have a very diverse, inclusive and equitable environment. And we're going to make sure that whatever it takes that we've got that. So we believe that we're really doing a lot of things to deliver on that. And we've got a lot of innovative efforts around bringing in a diverse workforce, which we have to have both because we're going to serve our customers best, their diverse. We have to match that diversity. And also, I just believe it's our responsibility, and it's the right thing to do. Any time there is any possibility that something is not gone the way we wanted to, we're going to investigate it thoroughly. That's what we're doing in the middle of doing in this case. And we'll make sure that we're operating in a way that's consistent with our values. And that's always the only goal. If you could rewind to the early 2000s, the earliest days of AWS, is there anything you would have done differently to build an inclusive culture to start with a more inclusive culture to make sure that it didn't become a boy's club? Well, I don't think that's what we have. I think that we do have a really fun, exciting innovation led and inclusive culture. And that being said, these are hard problems. I think we've done a lot, but we are nowhere close to where we need to be. We're going to be restless and dissatisfied with our progress on DE and I, just as we are with every other part of our business. Mark Zuckerberg is making a big bet on the metaverse.

17478," MUSIC AWS has the biggest trove of sensitive corporate data in the world. I'm curious how you think about the balance between data and privacy and freedom and civil liberties in the modern era. I mean, there are governments. There are nation states around the world that want that information. Hackers and criminals want that information. Well, we're very clear to start with that. Our first job is security. We often say security is job zero. It was on the first page of our operating plan pretty much every year, every year that I can remember. We're talking about when governments request that information. So, subpoena that information. Sure. Well, we are very clear that our customers data is their data. So the data belongs to our customers. And not everybody operates that way. We are not going to look at customers data. We are not going to compete against our customers using their data. Their data is their data. And furthermore, we have all sorts of architectural best practices that our customers should be and are using for any sensitive data. And so a lot of that really relies around encryption. And so we build a lot of different encryption capabilities so that any sensitive data, which could leak for any reason, be it to a government, be it to a hacker, be it to anyone else, any form of security breach, that it's encrypted and useless to anybody else. Given the broad array of encryption solutions that we provide, it's actually very doable and powerful for our customers to safeguard their data that way. Mark Zuckerberg is making a big bet on the metaverse. Is AWS going to have a role in the metaverse? I think AWS already has a big role in the metaverse. So I think the cloud enables the metaverse. So if you think about all of the compute capacity, all of the storage, all of the machine learning, which is required to create, compelling and delightful end user experiences in the metaverse, a lot of that is already today running on AWS. So if you take Epic Games, for example, so Epic Runs Fortnite, massively popular game, 350 million users worldwide and Epic Runs, almost everything on AWS from the backend, servers to the analytics and everything in between. So I think that's a great example of the metaverse at work and all that's happening today on AWS. And we anticipate that's only going to grow really rapidly in the future. How big do you think it's going to be? Such an interesting sentence, the metaverse is real. And yet it's virtual at the same time. I think that if we continue to do what we've always done, which is to provide a technology platform that allows organizations to transform, then these gaming and entertainment and social media and other companies will be able to do what they do best, which is to focus on innovating on behalf of their end users. And I think that the metaverse and many other areas will be rich with inventions. So this next conversation will happen in the spheres, in the metaverse. That's where we'll next meet. That could be, I'll meet you in the metaverse. All right, see you there. Now I know that climate change and stopping climate change and your data center footprint is a big passion of yours. How fast will Amazon's data centers get to carbon neutral? Amazon is already the largest purchaser of renewable energy in the world. And we intend to be 100% renewable energy by the year 2025. We originally said 2030. We actually accelerated that by five years to 2025. That's part of our broad climate pledge that Amazon created, and to which we've now gotten 200 other organizations to sign on to. And the climate pledge is to be nets are a carbon by 2040, 10 years ahead of the Paris Accord target. So we know how to do some of that. Other part are going to require invention, but we really look forward to it.

And I think it's one of the most important things we can do for our generation. Amazon counts some of the biggest oil and gas producers as its customers. Isn't that a contradiction? Should you be kicking them off your platforms? Those customers are trying to get to sustainable business models, which rely on new energy sources. And so many of those customers are figuring out how do they get to wind, how do they get to solar, how do they get into batteries, all new business models relying on renewable energy. And I think rather than abandoning them and having them maybe dig in more on fossil fuels, if we can enable them to move faster, to be more innovative, and to be more agile in figuring out new business models, new technical solutions, experimenting, failing fast, and moving on to the next idea, then the whole world will get to the renewable energy solutions that we need. At this year's re-invent conference, it'll be the first time that Andy Chassi is not giving the keynote. You will be, give us a preview. What can we expect to hear? We're going to have a lot of really exciting announcements. So I think across our service portfolio, you'll see that. We have a lot of exciting partner announcements. The partnership system still remains to this day so important to what AWS is doing, and we have some great announcements lined up for that. And then I think people are going to want to see that we're making it easier and easier for them to consume the cloud and to work with AWS. And so we're going to continue to, in addition to building more powerful basic capabilities, we're going to continue to make it easier and easier in a variety of ways to interact with AWS. Adam Salipski, CEO of AWS, thank you so much for joining us. So, to keep you safe, and remember, it's important to continue ring JERRY around the world to get aibly blended into the cloud workload.

Introduction Since this, very first YouTube video was uploaded 16 years ago, the world's most popular video network has exploded to more than 2 billion users in the farthest corners of the planet, now raking in billions of dollars every year.

17480," It's evolved a long way from cat videos to become a one-click journey to the center of the zeitgeist, pop culture, and kid culture. Amplifying some of the brightest and sometimes darkest traits in all of us. While YouTube has elevated a generation of creators and educated and entertained generations of viewers, it's fought misinformation, terrorism, racism, and violence many clicks along the way. Lately, YouTube's biggest battles are focused on eliminating COVID and vaccine misinformation and keeping the platform safe for kids and teens. On this edition of Bloomberg Studio 1.0, we rewind to talk about where YouTube has been and fast forward to where it's going next, with one of the longest tenured employees and women at Google, the CEO of YouTube, Susan Wajitski. It's been five years since we last talked on camera, and we have a new president. We are weathering a pandemic. The most watched video on YouTube is... Baby Shark? Baby Shark. So a lot's changed since 2016. How do you feel about YouTube 2021 versus 2016? I feel good about it. It's definitely been a while, and in technology things move so quickly, so a lot of things have changed since 2016. Overall, I've been really pleased that we've continued to grow and grow our ecosystem of creators, with invested a lot in responsibility. That's been a really big focus for us, with weather through a pandemic and a lot of hard challenges, but overall, I'm feeling really good. You've been at Google for 20 plus years, going all the way back to Larry and Sergey, in the garage, you've been the CEO of YouTube for seven plus years. How has your job changed in that time? Since I joined being the CEO of YouTube, I would say one of the biggest things that has changed, certainly, has just been maybe the recognition of the importance of digital video. When I first joined, actually a lot of people would say, oh, why did you join? I was running ads beforehand, and that's been the main way Google generates revenue. A lot of people said, why did you leave that and go to YouTube? But I always believed in digital video, and I believe that now we see that the world also believes we've seen a lot of adoption of digital video and the benefits that that can have. You've championed this diversification strategy at YouTube since you started. What's working and what's not working? Our main way of generating revenue is from advertising, but we also have really grown our subscription revenue, and that has been really, really important from many different reasons. That has enabled our users to have an experience where they can have music, YouTube music, and premium. We just announced the 50 million subscribers that we were really excited about, but we also see other ways that our creators generate revenue. So our creators, for example, generate revenue with channel subscription, they may sell merchandise. We also have things like digital goods, so like super chat, super thanks. And so we've basically diversified the number of ways that our ecosystem is generating revenue. The original tagline for YouTube was broadcast yourself, and that concept has exploded. You have ordinary people in the spotlight, when they grow up, they want to be an influencer. They want to be a YouTube star or a YouTube creator. What do you see as the future of the creator economy? I see a lot of possibility with the creator economy, and because I see that many people have a lot of interest, and they have a lot to offer. And beforehand, they wouldn't have been able to have shared that with the world. And so there are so many people depending upon what their talent or their interest is, whether it's a sport or cooking or gaming or hairstyles that people have come out and really been able to share that and create a lot of jobs. So we actually see, we actually saw a 35% increase in the number of creators that are generating six figure income out of YouTube. And in the last year. And so that's just...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,94,2022-11-17 04:35:07
17481," A 35% increase in the number of creators that are generating six figure income out of YouTube. And in the last year. And so that's just an example of like how the creator economy is continuing to grow. Well, and for years, YouTube was the only company that actually paid creators. But now a lot of companies are paying creators. Facebook, Instagram, Snap, TikTok. How do you see that competition playing out? Who wins? Well, it is a competitive landscape. And in general, competition's good. It makes everyone work harder and that's good. I mean, we look at creators and we say they're going to come to us if we do the best job. And creators come to us looking basically for fame and fortune. Like how can I have a skill or I have a talent? Something I want to share with the world. Like, and YouTube can help that be known, can help them provide that fame. But also we can generate revenue for them. And so as long as we're doing a good job of that, creators are going to come to us if we start to fail, then they're going to leave us and they're going to go to another platform. And so we just need to work really hard to make sure that we deliver that for our creators. A year ago during the Black Lives Matter protest, YouTube made big commitments to Black creators in particular. What's been the progress there? And how do you see YouTube, the potential for YouTube to be used as a tool for social justice? Well, so we've made the announcement that we were going to do $100 million Black Voices Fund. And so we're continuing to develop content there. But one of the other thing, and I think there's been a lot of great content that's come out and we'll certainly see more. But because YouTube doesn't have any gatekeepers, like you can just post and become a creator, we have seen a lot of people of different backgrounds and underrepresented backgrounds become creators and have audiences. We never really measured it beforehand because we didn't have a way. And so one of the things that we've done is we've enabled creators to now tell us what backgrounds they affiliate with so we can have a better understanding of how they're doing on our platform. Let's talk about YouTube shorts. It seems to be a top priority. We all know that TikTok is on the rise. How important are YouTube shorts to the platform, to the company? So YouTube shorts, it's very important. We see that creators and users want to watch all types of content, long form, short form. It turns out that the first video that was actually ever uploaded to YouTube, me at the zoo, was an 18-second video. So it was a short form video. And we have lots of short form videos. And we've had it way before TikTok did. But what we have really been leaning into more is just enabling those to be found. And then a lot of the creation tools. And so bringing a lot more mobile creation is really important for us going forward. Did you notice that viewing time was being lost to TikTok? Did you see that trend? And do you see TikTok as a sort of existential threat? I mean, we definitely see many competitors in this space. What we're just focused on are our own metrics. Like do we see our users engaging? Where's our opportunity? We're always looking around and seeing what our competitors are doing. And if they're doing something that we think would be good for our users and our creators, we're also going to look at how we can improve our own economy, creator economy, and what's good for our users. I think a lot of people, you know, we talk about vaccine hesitancy and they blame social media. They say YouTube's not doing enough. One of the big things for us is to continue to work with public health experts to get their messages across.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,95,2022-11-17 04:39:30

So, this tree house, you guys ready for the movie? See what we can do. At this point, YouTube has become a hub for discovery, for information, for, you know, it satisfies our curiosity, right? That comes with a lot of inspiration, but also with misinformation. When it comes to vaccines, vaccine hesitancy, videos that cause a public health risk, where do you want to see YouTube do better? We've taken responsibility very seriously. It's been one of my top priorities. So first of all, we want to make sure that if there's information that violates our policies, we came up with 10 different policies around COVID. Then if that's a violation of policies, then that's something that will remove. We removed over a million videos associated with COVID, but we also want to make sure that we're raising up information that we think would be, that come from trusted and authoritative sources. And we've really been able to do that. I think a lot of people, you know, we talk about vaccine hesitancy and they blame social media. They say YouTube's not doing enough, you know. How do you respond to that? Yeah, I mean, I think, first of all, we're always learning. I just, just to be fair, like we're always thinking about how can we do better? We're looking at the feedback and working with public health experts across the board. And, you know, I think one of the big things for us is to continue to work with public health experts to understand, you know, what are the ways that we can partner with them to get their messages across. And I really believe that that is something that's really changed is the evolution of bringing creators, musicians, experts talking about public health. We never would have seen that before in the pandemic. How much do you internalize the criticism of YouTube's content? Do you take it personally? And how does that influence the decisions that you make as CEO? I want to be doing the right thing. And I care about that. I care about the legacy that we leave. I care about the world that we leave to our children. I care about how media is consumed by the next generation and by everyone today. And so I really have put a lot of time and effort to make sure that we are acting responsibly. And there's always a balance between the free speech and the, right, but being responsible and taking down content that we think could lead to some kind of real-world harm. So, I mean, sure, I think whenever you're in a position like that, there's going to be a lot of criticism. But our goal is just to continue to talk to experts and evolve. And how do you make decisions in those tough moments where it's a tough call? Like how much of it is making a decision or leading by consensus and how much does it come down to you? The goal is that when we have tough decisions, they're not, we're not, they are like improvising in some way. We've made a concrete set of decisions beforehand. And then we're looking and saying, is this something that meets our standards? Is it a violation or not a violation? And if it seems like there's some set of issues with the content that we have on the platform, we're going to go back to experts and then reevaluate. Is it should we be making changes to our policies? YouTube helped keep a generation of children connected, educated, entertained, distracted through the pandemic. What have you learned from that experience? And what do you see as the potential future of YouTube as a tool for learning, as a tool in schools? When I meet people and they find out I'm the CEO of YouTube, almost always, they tell me about something they learned on YouTube.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,96,2022-11-17 04:43:55
17483," of YouTube as a tool for learning, as a tool in schools. When I meet people and they find out I'm the CEO of YouTube, almost always they tell me about something they learned on YouTube or someone that they're something their family member learned. So I see that as being a very significant part of YouTube. And during the pandemic, we certainly saw that a lot more education went online. And we had all the homeschooling. We had people who had to also just learn a lot of skills that they hadn't learned beforehand. But probably the biggest thing that we also learned was just and that I really saw was a need for us to continue to work with educational institutions. And the need for us to be able to integrate with some of the learning tools that the kids are all using because they are using YouTube. And there's a lot more that we can do to really help educators have YouTube be a key part of the curriculum. My kids are on YouTube a lot. And sometimes more than I want them to be. And sometimes it's super productive. And they're learning something cool. And sometimes it's not productive at all. How are you innovating to make the time that kids spend on YouTube more valuable? And of course, safe. It's very important to me as a parent to make sure that we're giving parents options about what they want their kids to see. And that's one of the reasons that pretty much as soon as I got to YouTube, we started working on YouTube kids, which is a separate app, which is important for kids, in terms of how we can control the quality. And we can give parents a lot more control about what kind of content is appropriate for them and their family. And there are many other things. We actually just came out with a supervised experience for tweens because tweens was one of the age groups that was actually hardest. They usually don't want to be on the kids app, but they're not 13 to be on the main app. And so the supervised experience is something that we recently came out with. The Wall Street Journal has been doing some in-depth reporting on Facebook. The report is that Facebook knew that Instagram was toxic for teen girls and didn't do anything about it. Does YouTube look at the impact it has on teen users? The influence it might have on someone's body image or self-esteem? First of all, I think it's a very important topic. And we do have a panel of experts that we work with to be able to help us understand what are the different ways that our product could be used or how do we face some of these challenging issues to make sure that we're getting the best advice. And we certainly do see for a lot of really tough issues that YouTube can be a really valuable resource. So body positivity, mental health, we see a lot of creators actually talk about mental health. And that for a lot of kids, it's really, like, destigmatizes and enables people to talk about what's happening and what's going on with them. The potential long-term impacts of YouTube on teens and on children, whether it is toxic or whether it's addictive, is that something that you wonder about? Is that something that you struggle with, not just as a CEO, but as a mom? We certainly want to make sure that we are doing what we can to be responsible with kids in every way possible. And that's one of the reasons that we actually have worked hard to give parents as many options as possible for them to decide what is important for them and their family, whether that's limiting screen time, limiting what is the content they actually have access to. Even letting parents just say, these are the 10 videos. My kid can only see these 10 videos. And so that is really important for us to give the tools back to parents for them to decide what is best for them and their family. Are you concerned about looming regulation? There may be regulation that is well intended, but actually then has a really negative impact.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,97,2022-11-17 04:48:17
17484," Be疫 G�� I would like to begin by addressing the heinous attack on the United States Capitol. Like all Americans, I am outraged by the violence, lawlessness, and mayhem. How much did President Trump test YouTube and how much did it test you as a leader? Election integrity is something that we see incredibly, it's incredibly important, and we've leaned into in every way we possibly can. We treat all public figures and all public leaders the same as we treat any individual. And so, meaning that everybody is held to the same standards. And so we definitely held President Trump as we would hold all other presidents and all other elected officials to the same standards that we hold our creators and anyone else on YouTube. But was that difficult for you as the CEO of the company? I mean, that's kind of a big responsibility. I mean, yeah, it is difficult, but it is very important and we also are global. So we're dealing with leaders from all over the world. And there were a number of leaders that, and there continue to be a number of leaders that post or that there's content that may be a violation of our policies. But we do hold a consistent standard across everything that we do. YouTube was the last platform to ban Trump, and you have said his channel will be reinstated when an elevated risk of violence has subsided. How and when specifically will you make that decision? Well, we'll make that decision based on a number of different factors, whether that is like events in the news, signals we're seeing from the government. And we'll certainly continue to evaluate that based on a large number of signals that we see. And will he ultimately be reinstated? I mean, we've stated that we will reinstate him when we believe that there is no risk to public safety or no public danger. Google just removed a voting app for Russian opposition leader Alexi Navalny. The Russian government seems to be stepping up requests to take down content. You've talked in the past about your family history, your grandparents living behind your curtain, being concerned about censorship back then. And Russia is a huge YouTube audience. How concerned are you about Russian government overreach? One of the things that is important to us at YouTube is the fact that we do enable so many voices and that we do enable people to express themselves and really celebrate the freedom of speech. And we certainly, that's a core value of ours. But when we work with governments, there are many things that we have to take in consideration, like whether it's like local laws or what's happening on the ground. And so there's always going to be multiple considerations that we're going to have to take into consideration. Navalny said that YouTube deleted a video, one of his videos. Was that at the request of the Russian government? We certainly get requests from governments. And we look and consider why are we getting the request, what's actually happening on the ground. And based on a whole bunch of different factors, we make a decision. So we don't always, those are not always requests that make sense for us to honor, but in certain cases, we will.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,98,2022-11-17 04:52:28

We will honor them in that country. The five administration seems to be targeting big tech. We've seen Mark Zuckerberg. We've seen Jack Dorsey now testify before Congress multiple times. And I've heard it said that YouTube is getting a pass. Do you think you should be up there testifying? Well, I think we do get a lot of scrutiny. I feel like there's a lot of scrutiny. And because YouTube is part of Google, Sundar has testified a number of different times and answered many different questions on YouTube. So I do believe there's a certain amount of scrutiny. And you know, if I were ever asked to testify, I certainly would go and testify as well. You're one of the most senior women at Google. If not the most senior woman at Google, Google has faced a lot of scrutiny for how it treats women in recent years. How much progress do you think Google has made in hiring and promoting women across the company? And how much progress do you think still needs to be made? I see a really big effort across technology as a whole to be able to be more inclusive. And I think that is really positive. I've been a big supporter of it. It's the very beginning. And I mean, I think at Google, there are many efforts and there's a lot of a lot of work that has been done. And I'm sure there's a lot more for us to continue to do. And if you just look at the stats, you can see there are not enough women. We need more women in technology. And I think we have made a lot of progress, but it's still hard. It's harder to be a woman in technology. It's harder to be a minority of any kind. And so I think there's still a lot of work for us to do. When we last spoke five years ago, you know, I asked you about being a mom. You have five kids and you said something that really stuck with me. You said being a mom makes me a better leader. I prioritize better. I see something growing fast and I run towards that. If something's growing closely, I'm like, I don't have time for that. How has that management strategy played out for you? I think it's played out really well. I mean, prioritization is everything when you look at it because we have a lot of opportunity. There's a lot of moving pieces, very dynamic environment. So if you can prioritize and say these are like the most important things to do, then you're going to get there faster. Larian, started having a left. How long do you plan to keep running YouTube? How long do you plan to stay at Google? As long as I have a mission that I believe in and that things that I'm excited about getting done. So I have a lot of ways that I see that YouTube can continue to grow. I have a lot of products and ideas and things that aren't yet released and things that we don't aren't yet doing. And I'm excited about getting those done. So I think if there comes a time where I no longer have a list of projects where I feel like I don't have that much more to add, then it'll be probably time to do something else. Would you throw your hat into the ring to be Alphabet's next CEO or if the board asked you would you step up and do that? Well, I think Sundar's doing a great job. I'm very, very, please. I think he's doing, I mean, it's a very challenging job. There's a lot of different constituents and a lot of product, a lot of different issues. And I mean, I'll just say I'll always do whatever would be wherever I could be most helpful to the company. Do you still talk much to Larry and Sergey? I do still see them socially though, not not work wise. Do you ever talk about work? I mean, sometimes we be casually, but our business is very complex right now. And there's a lot of things that are happening. And so it's hard for, I mean, people may have different opinions, but to really engage it's a long conversation. What do you want your legacy to be? I am proud of the way that we've been able to enable people to have a channel, to have an audience. Like I just met with a number of three, three creators. And like, YouTube really was able to let them shine and create audiences in a business and employ people that otherwise never would have happened. And so that's certainly one continuing to grow that. I'd say second, it's been really important to me to see a lot more women in technology. That has been just a personal goal of mine is to be a role model and try to support women.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,99,2022-11-17 04:56:49

The Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky proposed to address the investors and government officials right here at the Bloomberg New Economy Forum in Singapore. It comes fresh from his success in getting a majority of G20 nations to condemn Russia's war on his country. As the FTX followed, continues to ripple across crypto markets. Sanback, with freezers, he was mistaken about his exchanges level. And the World Cup kickoff is just days away. Scruiny of Qatar intensifies with new allegations that Gulf State is using the event to wash its image. I hear you've got some tickets already for the World Cup, the IPC. It's got 9-year-old cross-homer, I'm used to getting admitted to Dubai. I'm Managed Grannie right alongside you, in Singapore. No tickets for me, I'm going to be standing outside, probably very distant from the action. But we're in the action here at the New Economy Forum. It's interesting, you're so that the attempt by the UN and by Poland to try and deescalate the missile attack, the missile launch yesterday is pervasive across the news flow. But in terms of the Ukraine narrative, we have the founder of 4-2 SQM today. In the plenary session, Andrew Farr is saying he's prepared to put $500 million into the $25 billion fund. We need a $25 billion fund to rebuild Ukraine. When it comes to geopolitics, we've made a great deal about G and Biden not having to come by a moment, according to Biden. But Kevin Rudd, the former Prime Minister of Australia, is saying neither the United States of America and our China want a war. And then we talk about pivots, pivots from the Fed, but pivots from China. My guest in the last hour talked about that after the Congress, a pivot in policy, a pivot in zero COVID. It's very, very manifest. But what will Vladimir Zelensky's message be to the new economy forum? It's a gathering of capital, asset owners, asset deploys and risk takers. He joins our editor-in-chief, John Micklesweight, a little bit later on today. 12 noon, divine time, 4 pm, Hong Kong and 8 am in London. Yes, sir. Yeah, in the meantime, man, I am looking at equity futures on the S&P 500 mini that are pretty much flat. We're coming off the back of economic data on the retail side of things that showed a resilient consumer. You had quite a few Fed voices chip in, and this is where we stand. On U.S. 10-year yields, we are at 372.13. What stood out to me was, of course, the 210 yield curve tumbling to a fresh 40-year low. And then underscore some of the recession concerns. The Bloomberg dollar index gets a lift by 3-10s of 1% and then Brent crude down 1.1% with ING, with a new note. Seeing the Chinese demand remains a concern. I want to get to the Fed speakers, though, just a bit of a snapshot of, well, where we are at with some of the Fed funds rates and the implied futures. So this is a chart that tells the story, the current rate, and then all the way out to June 2023. You had the Fed hot Christopher Waller joining other officials in being open to half-point hikes. And he stressed the need, though, to keep going into 2023. One report doesn't make a trend he adds. It is way too early to conclude that inflation has had a sustainably down, Goldman Sachs changing their call as well. And they're seeing now at peak of 5 to 5.25%. And I also want to talk about evaporating liquidity. We talked about the bond markets in China, but I want to talk about nickel. Yes, again, we had the crisis earlier on in 2022. And now a bit of a, well, a bit of a...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,101,2022-11-17 05:05:28
17488," But I want to talk about nickel. Yes, again, we had the crisis earlier on in 2022, and now a bit of a, well, a bit of a trip back as it were. Important highlights here. Nickel falling as much as 12% of the tonn. The biggest decline in what is a historic short squeeze, as a result, LME is stepping up scrutiny of trading, and it is heightened concerns about the available liquidity, and as a result, they're saying, initial margins required to trade. Nickel is going to be raised to 6,100. Dollars at tonn, there's a 28% increase from current levels. Entry there. We are, of course, off significantly. I want to check with the markets in Browder Asia with Annabelle Dhrulers, and she joins us from Hong Kong. Hey, Annabelle. Thanks, you, Seth. Yeah, we're just out of the lunch break now for mainland markets, and also here in Hong Kong. And so far, we are seeing those declines still holding in the China tech space, really being led by what happened with 10 cents. So we did have the third quarter earnings out. Yes, we saw a quarterly revenue drop, but then also 10 cents confirming plans to divest its stake in May, once this is the Chinese food delivery giant. That's really what has led to the internet sell-off in China today. So we're seeing those moves also being not very much held by what's happening in net ease as well, because net ease has had a 14-year partnership with Blizzard to distribute gaming titles like Starcraft, World of Warcraft, in China for the past 14 years, as I said. And that has now ended. So we are seeing net ease declining by the most in more than a year today. But let's just change it on quick look across the border market landscape as well, because we are broadly risk off in the session today, really being led as well, you said, by other factors, like what you mentioned, retail sales, and also that more hawkishness still coming through from the Fed. Thank you very much for that, Annabelle. Annabelle Dhrulers, there. I want to talk about sentiment that took a head over night after strong US retail sales data and commentary from Fed officials, Annabelle, was just referring to that. San Francisco president, Mary Daly, stressed that Paul is off the table. She also sees rates rising to the 4.75% to 5.25% range. Meanwhile, the New York Fed official, John Williams, says he thinks the central bank should avoid incorporating financial stability risks into its considerations. Using monetary policy to mitigate financial stability and vulnerabilities can lead to unfavorable outcomes for the economy. And monetary policy should not try to be the jack of all trades in a master of none. However, Governor Christopher Waller left the door open to a 50 basis point hike next month. Let's bring in Norman Villama, he's the CIO for private banking at Union Boncaire Preve. Norman, I was looking through the retail sales data and it's a far cry from pain being felt among consumers. This is a story of resilient consumer spending. How could that actually affect what the Fed would like to do over the next two to three meetings? And how surprised were you? How do we get a number? So it remained quite strong. And I think that's going to be a key component of the Fed's consideration here. Because really what they're looking at, there's not a lot they can do about commodity prices, but they can do things about the consumer and employment. And at this point, those numbers remain pretty strong. Norman, good to have you with us. So tell me this, do you trust the depth of inversion in Tuesday's TANs? Is it ahead of itself? Is it a true indicator of the scale of the slowdown we can expect in the United States of America? I think it is. I think where we can see that already, we see the slowdown in exports coming out of China, coming out to the Pan, Taiwan, Korea, and historically that has been a good leading indicator for overall global demand and with that U.S. demand. So I think there is a slowdown coming down the tracks in the first half of 2023. Norman, I mean, I return back to a line from Bloomberg reporting around a requirement from the Chinese government for lenders to deliver on some of the details on bond exposure. And it underscores anxiety around evaporating liquidity, which we've seen in other bond markets around the world as well and really creates high risk for financial action. Could that be a turning point a bit on how central banks approach these risks?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,102,2022-11-17 05:09:52
17489," how the bond markets around the world as well, and really creates high risk for financial action. Could that be a turning point a bit on how central banks approach these risks? Yeah, I think the statement that you aired from the New York Fed President, John Williams, I think was very important here. And we've seen this in a couple of other central banks around the world. They want to approach these financial system risks on an idiosyncratic basis, if you like company by company, rather than what we've seen in the last two crises, which is using monetary policy very broadly to flood system with liquidity to effectively paper over some of these problems. So they're very much taking a different approach. And what that means is, yes, they're going to help deal with these problems, but it doesn't mean that you're going to get these risk on types of rallies as a result for any types of small problems. I mean, we're having a pause for thought in the hang saying this morning, I'm looking at it, financials 9.1.75%. It's giving them back a little bit. Lots of people came on the show with you, so when I say they could live without China, but do you feel, have you any possibility of full mo, are you incrementally getting more involved in China in any way? Or do you feel that there's a risk you could be left behind on a train that's leaving? I mean, we started re-weighting in China. We had been out of China for just about a year, but we started re-weighting in China back in August on the anticipation that coming out of the People's Congress in October that you would get some of the, I'll call it, cyclical stimulus that we've been seeing very recently. But I think the news out of 10 cent is a very interesting one. So the dividending out of their shares in May-Twan and effectively focusing on a large-scale capital management effort, that to me has caught my attention because one of the big problems, especially for the large internet players in China, has been access capital and falling returns to shareholders. And so any effort to change that, I think, has the potential to stabilize falling returns on equities that we've seen for the last few years in China. All right, let's talk about the excess capital with clients specifically. Some of them are going to have hordered cash and are looking for ways to get back into the market. How do you develop a tactical playbook for the next three to four months? Well, I think there's really two things that we're focusing on. One, for a lot of clients who have been forced in the cash because of one, the risks. They've been burdened until very recently with a pretty poor return to the cash. But now they can step out into investment grade bonds in dollar and get 5%, 6% returns without stepping out too far on the risk curve. And so for a lot of clients, that's an attractive first step going forward for a lot of them. This is their first step back into bonds, having been at the high quality equities, looking at equities where you have high visibility on earnings, high visibility on dividends, streams. And these companies have reathered whether the sell down in 2022 relatively well. We think it will represent a good entry point into equity markets in the first half of 2023. Norman, thank you very much for being with us. This morning, that is Norman Velman, the CIO for Private Banking over at Union Bonca, pre-V, nipping into China bit by bit. Let's get the first word, have lines from around the world. This means we're this in Doha. Thanks, Manus. Energy bills drove UK inflation to a stronger than forecast. 41-year high in October, adding to pressure on the government and the Bank of England to act. The Consumer Price Index rose to 11.1% from a year ago, higher than the Vioe's forecast for a peak of 10.9%. The result increases the chances that the central bank will raise interest rates again next month.

17490," 9% The result increases the chances that the central bank will raise interest rates again next month. The PBOC says the risk of inflation is rising in China because of changes in overall demand and it's pledged to balance supporting growth with price stability. The central bank's quarterly monetary policy report includes a promise to keep liquidity reasonably ample. The PBOC has sought to maintain cash levels in the financial system while keeping policy interest rates unchanged. Chinese President Xi Jinping confronted Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at the G20 summit, accusing him of leaking details of a private meeting. In an exchange caught on camera, Xi spoke through a translator appearing to reprimand Trudeau for leaking their conversation. After the private meeting, Canada's national post said Trudeau had raised, quote, serious concerns over allegations of Chinese interference in Canada's domestic affairs. And NASA says its uncrewed Orion spacecraft is on its way to the moon after a successful launch aboard its most powerful rocket in 50 years. The Boeing built space launch system blasted off from Kennedy Space Center. After two months of delays blamed on weather and technical glitches, the Orion capsule built by Lockheed Martin will come within 100 kilometers of the lunar surface early next week before returning to Earth December 11th. Global news, 24 hours a day, on air and on Bloomberg Quick Take, powered by more than 2700 journalists and analysts in more than 120 countries. I'm Simone Foxman. This is Bloomberg. You said. Thank you, Simone. Let's get you a snapshot of what else is still to come. We'll talk Middle East market strategy with Artichetra Secre and I'll show a capital who thinks the getting inflation under control, Euphoria is totally overdone. But next, Madison will be joined by the Paulson Institute's Deborah Lear at the new economy forum in Singapore. This is Bloomberg. China's military power has been growing at an incredible speed over the last 20 years. A strong country must have a strong military, as only then can it guarantee the security of the nation. In terms of sphere of influence, we absolutely know that China wants to be dominant in Asia. So there is a target to get to that point, to be a military that is appear to the greatest militaries in the world by 2035. The competition for influence is a global one, and through a multi-decade trajectory fueled by planning, money, and pragmatism, China is building a military that allows it to shape the 21st century just as the US shaped the 20th. Multi-trillion dollar industry, there's a lot of ground to cover. Come on, these guys absolutely crushed. We'll show you what's happening in ETFs like no one else.

17491," MUSIC It's an economy 2022. I'm Anna Schraini in Singapore. Deborah Lair is my guest. She is the vice chair, the executive director for the Paulson Institute joining me now. Time need to have you with us. Good to have you here in the seat, Deborah. We look at China signing the memorandum at the G20. Along with the other members, most members strongly condemn the war. High-significant, is it that G and China sign this? Or is it just another puff piece of reproach more? Well, it's certainly important that China signed it. If they hadn't signed it, that would have been a very strong signal against what the administration would have hoped for. So I do think it's an important signal that they did sign on with the G20. Does it build on the narrative, even though Biden said, look, it's not a combiarm moment, but there is no data about it. There have been incremental moments of agreement, whether it's on nuclear, talk in the world, or indeed other issues. Do you think it builds on the momentum that Biden set at the start of the week? I do. I think that the summit between the two leaders was a very positive thing. The most significant part of it was almost the body language, the fact that they were smiling, that they were sort of joking together was a very important signal. If I look at the other dynamics here, you've got a couple of things at play. You've got the West talking about the risk. Ray Dalio is talking about we're dangerously close to military action, and there's a risk. He says that a Republican House could pass an independent Taiwan act. I mean, this is something that's growing swells from no pact. There are growing swells for an independent Taiwan act. Does this concern the Biden administration, this kind of moot? There definitely has been a moot in both the House and the Senate about an independent Taiwan, or at least stronger ties with Taiwan, no question. And that the fact that Biden came out and made a very strong statement about Taiwan, I think was a very important element of what came out of the summit. How a Republican Congress is going to react to that is going to be, you know, remains to be seen. I think what's interesting is a great deal has been made off moving supply chains, the evolution of supply chains from the East back to the West. You say there is a fundamental difference in the narrative that we're hearing, and the facts, what do you mean by that? Well, I think we've heard a lot of narrative coming out of the West, and particularly out of the United States about, of course, the very important national security issues that we have, and the importance about segregating out certain types of technology. But when we look at China overall, and we look at the patterns of trade, we're not seeing significant decoupling. For example, last year, China was the largest source of direct foreign investment. This year, it's actually up again, and they're on track to still be the world's largest destination for direct foreign investment. We have seen some diversification of the supply chain, certainly, but we haven't seen a significant... It takes time to evolve that. It takes time to evolve and move your supply chain away. It does take time, and you have to find people who can do it at the same caliber and the same quantity as China, and that's very hard to find. We may see that diversification over time. We will certainly see decoupling in certain sectors, but we're not seeing a mass exodus from China. I look at you and you evoke the line, Envoy Penipotentry for Poles, and so the next question is very much around that foreign policy brief. Biden holds the Senate, or Biden, the Democrats hold the Senate. The Republicans take the high size of this morning. What does that mean for foreign policy for Biden? Is he emboldened? Or indeed, is he... How does that play out on the foreign policy stage? Because my experience of the U.S. is, unless it hits your pocketbook in the U.S., the American public don't really care too much about foreign policy. Right, well, and we found though, some aspects of foreign policy in this past year have hit the public. I have. And certainly when it comes to the issue of oil, when it comes to...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,105,2022-11-17 05:22:52
17492," foreign policy. Right, well, and we found though some aspects of foreign policy in this past year have hit the pocketbook. And certainly when it comes to the issue of oil, when it comes to agriculture, that's definitely true. And so I think those will be important parts. How do we look at, and I hope will be, how do we develop a trade policy that is helping to support our companies, particularly in agriculture? Typically though, we found in the second half of an administration, the president does focus more on foreign policy because it's one area that he has more authority and doesn't have to clear of a lot of it with Capitol Hill. I just wonder what that means for, I mean, it's a fractious relationship one could say with the societies at the moment. Again, another grinds well could be a right, no peck. But if you say, Manus, actually, second half, running up to the election, foreign policy could be a centerpiece of that election agenda. Oh, I'm not saying a centerpiece. I'm just saying, as you said, that hit the pocketbook. Let's take for example, the fact going back to China, Xi Jinping is planning a trip to Saudi Arabia in December. Yes. Right. And China is now Southeast largest trading partner. In fact, China is now the largest trading partner to 75 percent of the world. The U.S. held that position just 20 years ago. That has an impact on China's relationship and China's ability to work and influence these countries. Saudi is a very clear, important ally of ours on national security in the Middle East, an area that is critically important, obviously for oil, obviously for terrorism. And so how does that dynamic change with the increased relationship with China? How does it change? And will we really see a reassessment of U.S. policy towards Saudi Arabia as the Biden administration has said that it's going to do in light of the decisions that were made are cutting production? Indeed. And we call up with Emma Shokstein on that very subject recently. Debra, thank you very much for being with us. That is Debra Lear, Vice Chair and Executive Director at the Paulson Institute right here in Singapore, Yusuf. Thanks, President. It's fantastic conversation. I want to get to some lines coming through on the climate side of things. This is a draft statement that has been seen around COP27. And what is not going to happen is a broadening out of the commitment to face out unabated coal use to all fossil fuels, snuffing efforts by India and a key set of developed nations to include oil and gas under a bigger deal at COP27. So this is the first cover decision. They kept the pledges that were made at Glasgow, but you're not seeing a new inclusion there. The loss and damage component is going to be added once the draft is finalized, opposition to including fossil fuel usage would of course come from countries like Saudi Arabia where there was concern that push back from their side would stop. And he consensus around a final draft that will of course be covering unfolding events in COP27 from Sharma Shoshua at the week. Much more ahead, this is Bloomberg. How much I could push have you seen from the Qashira government in terms of green funding? The Qashira administration has committed to doubling the amount of investments in so-called green technologies. I think we need more than just pronouncements. We need real money backing, very innovative startups and innovative companies in this space. What do you make of Qashira's new capitalism? Well, I think he is framework is reflective of the challenges that Japan's society is facing, namely that growth has been present, but growth has not been of course evenly distributed. But frankly,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,106,2022-11-17 05:27:12
17493," It has been present, but growth has not been of course evenly distributed. But frankly speaking, it's hard to redistribute income if you don't have a income to begin with. If the government and private sector can work together and collaborate to drive more innovative growth startups, that can really drive the income growth that the Kishita government needs to redistribute.

Let's circle back to Middle East equity markets get you the 35,000 feet view as it were. This is the state of playing the last trading session broadly negative as investors reacted to geopolitical news in terms of tensions between the U.S. and China. That was later clarified around the missile that fell into Poland. So you're likely to see a relief rally later on today. Two things I'd look out for is the Saudi Tadalog group adding three additional or being added to three additional Futsu Russell indices and HSBC coming to hold a Dua that's going to affect the Dubai trade when it comes online in about 30 minutes. I want to flip the board and get to the Treasury's trade because that is front and center as we think about the economic data we got overnight in terms of retail sales and the long list of Fed voices that chimed in as well. U.S. 10s of 371 76. I would pay particular close attention to the Bloomberg reporting around the potential liquidity issues in the China government bond market and that the government is asking lenders to disclose the extent of some of their positioning. Equity futures called just barely higher on the flatline quite a bit of yeah, whipsawing as we look for a catalyst. Now a little bit higher actually a fifth of 1%. This is Bloomberg.

As US retail sales charge ahead the Fed pushes back against the pivot narrative.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,107,2022-11-17 05:31:34
17494," This is the public day break, Middle East. Our top soy is this morning. As U.S. retail sales charge ahead, the Fed pushes back against the pivot narrative. San Francisco President Mary Daly knows he's rates rising to 3.4.75 and 5.25%. The Ukrainian President of the Lodemirsilensky prepares to address investors and government officials at the Bloomberg New Economy Forum in Singapore. And it comes fresh from his success in getting a majority of G20 nations to condemn Russia's war on his country. As the FTX fallout continues to ripple across crypto markets, Sam, Bankman, Freed, as he was mistaken about the exchanges' leverage levels. And with the World Cup kicking off in a few days, scrutiny of Qatar intensifies. New allegations are out. The Gulf State is using the event to wash its image. Let's check back in on the market's in Asia. Andable droolers in Hong Kong has all the critical angles. Annabelle. Thanks, Yusafia. We're looking pretty risk off in Asia as we head into the afternoon session. As you can see here, for that picture for equities, mostly in the red today. Given that we didn't have quite a good lead in from Wall Street, we had those better than expected retail sales. So that told us or investors at least that the economy can withstand more Fed rate heights. And then also adding to that, we had Fed voices, the likes of Governor Chris Waller, also San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly saying that, yes, we might see a moderation in terms of the size of the hikes, but still any sort of pause is off the table for now. So that's also feeding into dollar strength. And then the flip side of that, of course, is currency weakness in this part of the region and the Korean one is leading that. And then also these recession risks that we saw in the Tuesdays, curve, particularly most inverted since the early 80s, also in those longer duration debts, including the Aussie 10 year yield at dropping 10 basis points. But just changing on now, we're also taking a look at what's happening in the shorter duration, yields as well in China. You can see it take a look at this chart here. We're now at the highest for the one year bond yield since January. And this is really quite interesting, you said, because it's a bit of a side effect that we're seeing in the country. It's we have that big bounce in stocks given this pivotal expectations to pivot away from COVID-0. It is still sparking a move away from fixed income products. And I blew my scuba in this, of course, I've been reporting on, is that banks are being told to report on their ability to service their short term debt obligations in China, you said. Liquidity paradigms are being put to the test. I mean, be it FTX, I mean, arguably that's just mismanagement for the most part. But crypto broadly, you're seeing it in some of the metal markets with nickel and now in the government bond markets in China. Yeah, that's right. There's certainly some concerns there around liquidity in the Chinese debt space. And that's why banks are being told to report on their obligations. But still we are seeing a lot of optimism around the outlook for the Chinese economy, including from the likes of Goldman Sachs. And they're basically saying that we're going to see a further easing of COVID-0 policies as the leadership reshuffle comes to an end in March with the so-called two sessions taking place. And so that will really allow a consumption to continue to rebound. Also, core inflation to start to pick up a little bit. And then that will also lead to a normalization of cyclical policies there as well. So they're saying GDP grows, expanding next year to 4.5%. A bank of America, if you just change on quickly, has a new note out as well. Also taking a look at this shift away from COVID-0. And they're basically saying that we could expect to see a further reopening again in the months ahead. But still that the government in China could be looking to borrow from Hong Kong's playbook, which we did manage here to reopen mostly in about three quarters, and that also use have local governments could be given more autonomy here to experiment. ANAVIL, thank you for that. That's ANAVIL, through Lester. Let's get to the inflation on the control market euphoria. Apparently it's overdone. At least that's the view at your capital. And they're saying that the rate rally is likely to reverse with implications for investment strategies in the Middle East. Joining us now is the Shua Director of Investments Archive Chattersecker. And Archive, what is the thesis then at Shua Capital around this? Because it pushes against the grain of what clearly is an emerging consensus around rates. I think the rates, rally that we have seen is likely to reverse because Fed is unlikely to pause the hiking cycle. For Fed to pause the hiking cycle.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,108,2022-11-17 05:36:08
17495," Because Fed is unlikely to post the hiking cycle. For Fed to post the hiking cycle, three things have to happen. One, we need to see stickiness in terms of downtrend in the inflation. We need to pick up in the deceleration of inflation over time. And lastly, we need to see the core inflation of US coming down below the Fed fund rates. Unless all of this is going to happen, I don't see a reason why Fed would actually post the tightening cycle. So I think the market is regizing prematurely and it's not actually what weren't it? What do you need implications come from that for some of the regional trading ideas? Because I think of going neutral on duration maybe and then the premium on the cokes as well. So we're going neutral on durations obviously because the rates, the yield curves have not peaked that. We think the curve is going to be super volatile in the short term and the near term. So we tend to think that there's upside risk to the 10-year yield at 4% and above. One thing that caught my eye is that you started your research notes on the equity side with Egypt. Now that the devaluation is out of the way, I mean we're what, 24.4 against the US dollar now, you're seeing a particular play with the largest lender, right? Right. Devaluation is behind us. Investors must be super glad about it because the macroeconomic concerns are not anymore there. At least it's not there as much it was last two months before. So obviously the focus is back on fundamentals, you see. And I think Kami is something which is a commercial bank of Egypt, which is something which has got a lot of tension. Trades at 1.3 times, book historically trading at a very, very cheap valuation used to trade at 3 to 4 times book even higher than that on good days. Super enticing bank from an emerging market play. Very good asset quality, good lending growth and highly liquid as well. In the United Arab Emirates we had some earnings out from some of the real estate developers where there's this emerging weakness. Time to step away from that and reallocate into some other names perhaps some more defensive ideas. Quarter three saw some hits and misses as far as UAE's concerned. Real estate was softer than expected. Banks, just two of the banks, ADI, BNNBD came. Our respectack numbers, rest of the banks did just so well. What held up for the quarter three numbers of UAE was consumers, the restaurants, retail, tourism, Arabian numbers, the bielectricity numbers, Salic numbers, Aaktia numbers, all these were so robust. So was the oil and gas sector which was adnog distribution came with stellar numbers as well as adnog drilling. Going into next year, I think all these sectors will continue to do well for the first two quarters. But then let's be mindful of the fact you said we have a corporate tax coming up June 2023 predominantly almost all the companies will start seeing the acceleration in terms of their earnings growth because of that. And we have to see how the valuation plays across them. We're counting on to the world cup. We're just three days away apparently and I still haven't made arrangements as to where I'm actually going to watch it. Just in terms of the valuations in Qatar, the value proposition, visa, visa, Saudi Arabia, we put those two indexes together, year to date and it's quite the differential. And this definitely is especially Qatar is kind of losing its charm. It's kind of the catalyst for Qatar looks super blur at the moment because we do think that there will be a scale back in terms of business expansions, in terms of headcounts, in terms of employment. So all of this is going to start coming down and it'll start trickling down to PMIs. PMIs have started normalizing below 50 actually as we speak. And if you look at the earnings for quarter three for Qatar, banks actually reported not so great earnings be it CBQ or QIB. So the weakness is there and you can see it already playing out. What is there to watch out for Qatar is the Pet Camp's projects, if it kick struts, then that would be your catalyst for Qatar going forward. I was talking earlier on in the show about the note from ING that focused on the demand side of the energy equation and the crude oil markets. Now we're getting closer to $90 a barrel for Brent. At what stage do you get a little bit nervous for this part of the world? We've gotten so used to seeing Brent above $90 a barrel that anything below that could easily create a level of nervousness.

17496," Anything about ATM more comfortable, I'm sure everyone in the region is more comfortable. AT is a very good number for oil to be at. But having said that, we think oil will be range one because, assuming and hoping that we see a full easing of China's COVID-19 policy, I think that would actually boost the oil prices in the near term.

Still much more to come on the program. This is Bloomberg. Thank you. You're welcome. MUSIC An oil tanker linked to the Israeli billionaire has been hit by a projector by 240 kilometers off the coast of Iran. The US says an Iranian drone was probably responsible. Simone Foxman has more. So another incident, another accident, we don't know the outcome of that yet. But what do we know so far? Well, US and Israeli officials seem to believe this was definitely caused by Iran. This happened late Tuesday night. Minimal damage, we understand, to the tanker itself, which is owned by a company led by Yaddaan O'Fare, who is an Israeli billionaire, hence the involvement of the Israelis in this. A very strong statement from National Security Advisor in the US, Jake Sullivan, who said that there is no justification for the incident, and that it fits a, quote, pattern of such actions and broader destabilizing activities by Iran in the region. We've seen a spate of maybe a little bit of escalation around the Gulf of Oman, Persian Gulf area, but you kind of have to put this in context of what's happening within Iran itself, wondering if this is maybe a distraction from that. There is an upsurge of violence in Iran around these ongoing demonstrations. Fifteen people, guys, killed since just Tuesday alone as these strikes, as these protests continue, and particularly the last couple of days, have been the three-year anniversary of 2019 fuel protests. The recent big protests before this latest round. We saw the judiciary continue to hand down very harsh sentences to demonstrators, three more being sentenced to death, bringing the total death sentences handed down to five. And from some of those tragic events, let's turn to the World Cup. We're just three days away. What's the situation like in Doha? Give us a sense of the feeling on the ground. It's very busy here. It hasn't been this busy ever in my recollection over the past three years, and that's really what's been signaled in the numbers. There are some three million people in the country.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,110,2022-11-17 05:44:51
17497," It hasn't been this busy ever in my recollection over the past three years. And that's really what's been signaled in the numbers. There are some 3 million people in the country. This is pretty much the last day of school being in session. The official end of term date is tomorrow, Friday, which is a weekend day. So all the kids are going to be out in the streets. You see traffic when you go everywhere. But we are already facing some degree of controversy in particular. A Danish TV crew was filming live from Katara, which is a sort of like a mall like development in the northern part of Doha's main municipality area. And they were filming and then security guards came up and told them to stop mid broadcast, tried to kind of grab the camera, threaten maybe to smash it. And this set off an international incident, frankly, because these broadcasters are officially by their accreditation allowed to film there, even though filming there isn't something you can normally do without a lot of approvals. The organizers immediately apologize to this TV crew. But we're seeing these viral moments, guys, really take over, Twitter and the like. And again, we're watching whether or not this sort of thing continues as we get into the actual match playing phase of the World Cup. Yeah, the distance between, I suppose, a narrative and an instruction in the reality. I watched it. It was the first thing that came up on my Instagram this morning, the broadcaster having a little bit of a run-in. What about carbon neutrality for the World Cup? I mean, they claim that they will be carbon neutral. Is there a discrediting of that claim? There absolutely is. And this is the refrain we have heard from green activists a lot over the past couple of days. In fact, they believe that this could be the most carbon-intensive World Cup ever. Listen to our explanation of why. In 2010, FIFA announced that Qatar would host the 2022 World Cup. In 2010, it's been the country promised to make it a carbon neutral tournament. But as the matches approach, environmentalists are claiming that Qatar has greenwashed the World Cup and that the event will put millions of megatons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. So that claim is mostly a PR clay. Essentially, there is no way that a mega event of that size can be carbon neutral. FIFA can do better and should do better. And my focus would be on encouraging to do that for the next World Cup. The UN defines carbon neutrality or achieving net zero carbon emissions as balancing a measured amount of carbon released with an equal amount offset. First step is to measure your emissions. And so that's what FIFA has done for the World Cup. We looked into that calculation and we think that this is quite significant on the estimated. So there's two big challenges with any carbon neutrality claim at an event of this size. The first one is travel. And the second part of this is construction. 75% of the carbon footprint of all sports stadium over their entire lifetime is locked in on day one from the materials that built from. It's not about operating costs. It's about concrete steel. Qatar has invested billions of dollars in infrastructure for the tournament, including building seven new stadiums. Organizers estimate that the World Cup will emit 3.6 megatons of carbon dioxide. The construction of this stadium is the most problematic elements because it's the element that we think was most massively on the estimated. From that factor, we think the total footprint would be 5 million tons. International flights in and out of Doha will account for the majority of emissions. However, organizers argue that this World Cup will be more energy efficient than others since fans won't have to fly to different venues and can instead just take public transit. The sticking point is always the flights. Most Olympics and World Cups, it accounts to more than 85% of total emissions. Balancing carbon emissions with offsets is key to carbon neutrality. So far, Qatar has purchased less than 350,000 carbon offset credits of the 3.6 million needed in their estimation. The Supreme Committee says that it is already security.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,111,2022-11-17 05:49:00
17498," 150,000 carbon offset credits of the 3.6 million needed in their estimation. The Supreme Committee says that it has already secured a minimum of 1.5 million credits from the Global Carbon Council and that further details will be forthcoming. So far, greenwashing issues are not keeping fans from rooting for their teams on the pitch. An estimated 1.7 million people will be in attendance with over 3 million tickets sold, but with a warmer future ahead, effects on fans will soon be felt. Sports is the most enormous opportunity to tackle the climate crisis because we can engage football fans and make them advance of the environment through their favorite sport. Now you heard some criticism there of Qatar's use of carbon offsets, but I want to point out some of our latest reporting from Natasha White and Verity Radcliffe who write a story detailing some of the underlying issues with the quality of the carbon offsets that Qatar has been buying. They've been buying these credits from the Doha-based and relatively newly formed Global Carbon Council, but these credits are tied to renewable energy projects in middle-income countries. Now these aren't the kinds of projects that most of the top issuers would actually go and certify because they say they would happen anyway typically. So we're not only seeing some disputes with the actual way that Qatar is going about trying to buy these offsets, but also now with the underlying offsets themselves.

17499," to address US security concerns over user data. And that is your Bloomberg business flash. It's got to an important corporate angle because the CEO of Food and Agriculture Giant Cargill says food prices will probably decline next year, even as global crop stockpiles stay very tight. David McLennan spoke to Bloomberg at the new economy forum and called on world leaders to keep borders open to improve food security and bring down prices. I mean, the world depends on an interconnected food system in order to have not only availability, accessibility, but relative price stability as well. And so there's comparative advantage. There are a few countries, Sarah said it, that can produce everything they need. We've got to rely on open borders. We've got to rely on trade. And anytime that you have disruption due to either geopolitical conflict like what we're seeing in Ukraine, or trade barriers like what we saw between the US and China several years ago, you're going to see a spike in prices. It is not natural instincts of political leaders when there are shortages or inflation. They want to make sure they have enough food for their own country, but that's the worst thing you can do. Even though it feels I got to keep food at home, people have got to eat when they don't eat. They get hungry, when they get hungry, bad things happen, for obvious. What about the criticism of the Western food companies are taking advantage of the crisis right now? I don't know what logic that is based on. Certainly, Western food companies are mission is to nourish the world, to make sure food gets to where it's needed. The corridor being open has been a big relief since the invasion that you crane back in February. But I'm not sure where that thinking would come from, that there's some type of Western food conspiracy to make sure the food doesn't get to people where it's needed. But companies have benefited a lot during this time. We've done our job, and we've gotten food from where it's produced to where it's needed. We've managed through volatility, we've managed through supply chain disruptions. I think the world's food workers have shown the resilience of the system. You can think about debates of who's going in the office and who's going to work from home. Food workers, farmers, they're there every day. That's how the world has continued to, the world food system has worked in the last two years. Are you actually seeing some of that labor shortage also affecting perhaps contributing to the inflationary pressures? For sure. So not only with COVID disruptions, but also with labor shortages and migration of people from, you know, one industry to another, but certainly in our meat business in the US in particular, we've had significant labor shortages, which have add to productions scalebacks, because we don't have the labor to staff the plants. And the situation, what will it take to have sustainably lower prices to ease this food inflation that's really making a lot of people go hungry, especially in developing and emerging economies? To take three things. It would take collaboration, and I know it's a frequently used word, but as a supply chain, everyone who's supporting egg supply chains, including governments that have the wrong type of knee-jerk reaction, they have to collaborate in a way that is systems thinking forward. The companies across the supply chain must collaborate and co-invest. And from the commodity space, I take you to equity futures as you prepare for the remainder of the Thursday. We're looking at an S&P 500 mini that is holding on to marginal gains of about the fifth of 1%, we had economic data that surprised to the upside on retail sales, and we had a long list of fed voices to dissect, and with that in mind, I'm also looking at Eurodollar. Not so much about what the Fed may or may not do. This is more about the ECB. So policy makers may slow down interest rate hiking with only a 50 basis point increase next month, that's according to people familiar with the matter. In the inflation surge, might yet convince policy makers, otherwise, though, in the momentum, is lacking for another aggressive 75 basis point step. That's going to be factored into a lot of the discussions throughout the next few hours. With that in mind, also treasuries. We've got the hawkish camp in the Fed spectrum, Christopher Waller, joining others and being open to a half point hike. So that is the surprise factor. There are a little bit.

17500," at Spectrum, Christopher Waller joining others and being open to a half point hike, right? So that is the surprise factor. There are a little bit. One report doesn't make a trend on the inflation side he adds. It is way too early to conclude that inflation is headed sustainably down. You're saying you're yields of three, a 71. Let me also show you Bitcoin as we keep a close eye on FTX and the ongoing fallout from litigation to other claims. Currently Bitcoin is marginally higher, a tenth of 1% around the $16,500 mark.

17501," Today decline. Face into the storm, UK Chancellor Jeremy Hunt delivers his highly anticipated budget statement today, seeking to stabilize public finances amid economic headwinds. Plus, US Republicans flip the house by a narrow margin, giving the GOP power to thought President Biden's agenda in the second half of his term. Breaking lines coming through, it is Zeeman's earnings, and it is a beat. They're seeing their EPS pre-purchased price allocations, the range, the low end of it is 8.7 euros to 9.2 euros. The estimate had been for 8.6. They're also seeing their sales 2023 comparable sales. That will be from 6% to 9%. Also beats across the board when it comes to their fourth quarter net income sales orders in industrial profit. It is a brighter outlook from Zeeman's amid a very challenging backdrop in Germany. In these earnings, just looking through them, they say they have a high backlog, and they continue to avoid any major disruptions from supply change, which showed signs of easing. All of that said, they write that their 2023 outlook is based on one, geopolitical tensions do not escalate further, and two, challenges from COVID-19 and supply chain constraints continue to ease. It is worth noting at the same time we have tisten-crupped earnings out as well, and this is really a tale of two different industrial giants. They, on the other hand, are expecting just a break even in 2022 and 2023, and they see their earnings dropping in a weakening economy. So Zeeman's powering ahead while tisten-crupped is being affected by that weakening economy. Now, to the overall market environment, yesterday was a day when we certainly got a vote of no confidence from the bond market. The yield curve, reaching its most inverted levels since the 1980s, at one point, it dropped to around 67, negative 67 basis points yesterday. So here we have it, another fresh low in this cycle. It is clear that at least some investors out there are expecting that rate hikes will deliver a hard landing. You have Waller yesterday saying, hey, get comfortable with half-point hikes and strong retail sales data as well. So all of that means that, yes, 10-year yields they fell yesterday were looking at a higher 10-year yield today. So let me show you the cross asset board over the past two days, not counting today, that 10-year yield dropped by 16 basis points. It is the first time in this cycle that the 10-year yield has fell below the effective funds rate. So we've had a lot of hawkish Fed speech, and it's a double whammy of that, plus more COVID cases in China, the highest since April. All of that resulting in a Remembee that's weaker this morning and crude. That is also falling, we're at $84 a barrel when it comes to 9x crude again, those concerns over China, COVID and demand. So we really are pairing some of those reopening bets, but at the moment, now tons of action in this equity market after a drop in U.S. shares yesterday futures are higher by 2-10th of 1%. So it's also day three at Bloomberg's new economy forum and the global business, finance, and policy leaders. They've been discussing the risk currently at play in the world. We would really want to hear that the perpetrator country is a Russian Federation. We would be happy if the state could be named a state. China and the United States as two major countries both stand to gain from cooperation and lose from confrontation. The second is the equity marketing of a bridge-building effort. As we look at supply chains around the world, they were fit for 20 to 30 years ago. The central banks misread the signs. They misread the risk of persistent and much higher inflation. My team for choice, things 2023, we avoid a recession. I'm a little more skeptical. We're going to have new and improved data access protocols such that only an entity of U.S. residents in the U.S. will have access to a sudden set of U.S. protected data.

Manus, day three, your role tour, it's almost over. It's almost coming to an end. Those hermels and Emirates peanuts, they're inextricably linked. I caught up with Anthony last night at the dinner. We had a galodine there. Mike was there. A lot of the people who have been arreigned this conference with her. And Skyrimuchi, we're chatting offside. And you know, he's got a tough battle on his hands to get his equity or certainly not his money at the moment, but his equity back. I leave that crypto, the crypto cowboys as Bill Winters calls them, not me. Bill Winters. And indeed, Nuri Rabini went after the crypto cried last night on Twitter. It was fairly visceral. But to this gathering, it is about reading the tea leaves of US-China relations. And I think perhaps a man who's a veteran of that world is better placed to encapsulate what the world doesn't want. It's Kevin Rudd. On the critical flashpoint question of Taiwan, my own analysis is that neither side now wants a war over Taiwan. And the reason for that is not because of a lack of nationalism. The reason for that is because both sides are concerned they might lose militarily. Well, if your optionality is to lose, you don't want to be on that trade. I also caught up with one of the policy advisors at the Paulson Institute, Cracking Compensation with Debra Lilleur. And she made the point that as far as China and Xi signing on to the memorandum at the G20, that you may not put a huge store of value on it. But if they hadn't have signed onto that memorandum against the war, that would have been much more substantial. And it builds on the G-biden narrative. I think the other thing that I just finished off with here, Danny, is we had four-discute metals on the podium as well, talking about the contribution of, you know, to rebuild Ukraine. And to that point, a $25 billion front may be needed to rebuild Ukraine. As we go to the close in Singapore, any F-2022, the last word will go to Ukraine, to Zalensky. He joins John McEathway to in conversation. That's in just under a couple of hours' time. I think I'm the warm-up act. I'm talking COP for 15 minutes. I'm talking to some of Shukri, the president of COP. We've had headlines on COP. Haven't we in the past 15, 20 minutes about the language of facing out of coal? So I think that that's going to be an important conversation to have as well, because loss and damage is top of the agenda at COP 26. So we will catch up with the president of COP, Simey Shukri. And we'll put those questions to him in terms of, what do you make of the most recent language of the statement that has been released? I'm so far away from an inverted yield curve. I've never been happier. What do you mean, Manus? I can't quiz you about the most inverted yield curve since the 1980s? What's going on here? Where are the manus? Where are the manus? There we go. There we go. The inner book. Is it 68.969.9? You're quizzing me. We're at 66 and a half, Manus. See, I'll keep you up to date on it. I got it for you, Manus. I'm an artist, Granny there. In Singapore, at Bloomberg's new economy forum. Quiz in the gas there, and quizzing me too, Manus. Always a joy. Now, let's get to our reporter, some around the world. In about Julesz, following a Bloomberg scoop that's driving short-term, China debt lower. Suvastry Ghost brings us latest developments in the ever-evolving crypto saga, while Lizzie Burton is on hand at Westminster to preview Jeremy Hunt's pivotal autumn statement. But first, let's start with China. And we're told that regulators are asking banks to report on their ability to service debt obligations. So let's get over to Annabelle Julesz, Annabelle, this, of course, coming after this huge move in China's bond market. What do we know? Yeah, that's right, Denny. Let's just kick off, actually, with that move that we've had in the debt market here. You can see that one year bond yield spiking by the most since mid-2020. And it really does tell us what we've seen so far with this pivot in China, falsibly away.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,116,2022-11-17 06:10:46
17503," and see that one year bond yields spiking by the most since mid 2020 and it really does tell us what we've seen so far with this pivot in China possibly away from its COVID-19 policies improving tensions possibly they were discussing there with the West and then also these measures to support the property sector. So all of this has seen a really big move into equities and then out of fixed income, fixed income products. So then off that we are seeing it. Well. I think I think we might have just lost Annabelle there a bit some technical issues. Of course, Annabelle Jouler is going over the scoop that China is looking at bond market liquidity. Of course, it's a very pressing issue for this market considering what happened in the UK. We'll try to get back to Annabelle later if we can. For now, let's take a look at crypto and the fallout from the rapid collapse of FTX is spreading. Around the industry it's even installed the two billionaire Winkle Voss twins through a liquidity squeeze at their lending partner Genesis here to help us break all the complications down is sub-astry ghost so sub-astry. How do we look at the contagion now? How far has it spread? Thank you so much for asking that question. It is indeed a contagion that is spreading fast and wild in the crypto world. We've seen that as you mentioned, Genesis has frozen with draws. It is a crypto brokerage and it has 175 million dollars of its derivatives business on FTX's platform which is bankrupt. That has had a spillover effect on the Gemini crypto exchange which is owned by Winkle Voss twins. Gemini has earned product and that has 700 million dollars of exposure to Genesis and that's where the linkage is. They had to hold withdrawals from that product called Ern, Genesis Gemini. We have seen that major withdrawals have started overall from Gemini, overall crypto exchange in Gemini. We've seen 500 million dollars of withdrawals already in the 24 hours which is like eight times more than its inflows that shows that the contagion is spilling and it's spilling faster in exchanges. We are yet to see the end of it. We are still still in the middle of this heavy contagion effect. We certainly are still in the middle of Sam Begman-free tweets. He is truly just tweeting through it saying that the company got overconfident and careless in tweets late yesterday. Thank you so much for joining us. The Chancellor Jeremy Hunt delivers his on-budget statement today. He wrestles with inflation at over 11% in the year to August, the highest in more than four decades. We will now have a draft for the fiscal statement. The new Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has said that today we can expect eye-wateringly difficult decisions when it comes to spending cuts and tax rises. The new Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has said that today we will have a draft for the fiscal statement. The difference between this fiscal statement and the mini-budget in September is that this time the Office for Budget Responsibility is going to be allowed to provide a forecast this afternoon alongside the statement. The new Chancellor Jeremy Hunt's economic adviser is that they are not too worried about the market reaction because of the newly respectful relationship between the Treasury and the economic institutions. My question, Danny, is are they taking liberties, relying too heavily on the dullness dividend?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,117,2022-11-17 06:15:00
17504," Between the Treasury and the economic institutions, my question, Danny, is are they taking liberties, relying too heavily on the dullness dividend? I mean, that is such an excellent point, Lizzy, because this is a market that has proven to be very fragile. So with that in mind, what could be the surprises that throw this market, and I suppose any other observers off? Well, there's always a rabbit out of the heart when it comes to a budget, even though Jeremy Hunt has said there won't be, Richie Soonack likes to under promise and over deliver. So the questions that we're remaining to find out are, how much of the fiscal squeeze is going to be backloaded until after 2024 when there is expected to be a general election? What will be the balance between tax cuts, tax rises, herbivoreate and spending cuts? Who is going to be hit with the tax rises and who is going to benefit from the spending? And also, how much is Hunt going to overcompensate for the fiscal gap? But the good surprises may be some more spending on education and we're expecting billions of pounds to be spent on insulating people's homes to bring down energy demand. Well, Lizzy, I got to say one thing that is certainly not surprising is how rainy and grim the weather is behind you there outside of Westminster. Lizzy braven the elements for us out there, Lizzy burdened. And of course, stay tuned because Lizzy will be helping to lead our special coverage of the UK autumn statement a little bit later. It's a lineup of key guests and expert analysis that will start at 9.30 a.m. London time.

And on Chief Future Officer, they focus on much more than just revenues and margins. The odds have to be credible business leaders in order to really impact the business and steal the direction.

Get passion, perspective, and more from the chief future officers of some of the world's most influential companies. A new episode every month, only on Bloomberg. The top names at the Fed are on Bloomberg. I think it will probably be appropriate soon to move to a slower pace of increases. But we have additional work to do.

17505," slower pace of increases, but we have additional work to do. Nobody covers the Fed like Bloomberg. Looking forward to the FOMC's December meeting, the data of the past few weeks have made me more comfortable considering stepping down to a 50 basis point hike. Fed Governor Christopher Waller there on the past that will likely be 50 basis points from here on out. Joining the program now is Althoff Kassam, a me ahead of investment strategy and research at State Street Global Advisors. Althoff, thank you so much for joining. So I want to take you straight to the Yield curve because I know you were sitting by the side and you saw the first thing this morning was I got a straight up quiz from Manus on where the Yield curve is. So I got a quiz you too. Look, we are near our most inverted or at least we were there yesterday since the 1980s. That's the chart we're looking at at this moment. And this comes as it does feel like some analysts are more hopeful for the economy. At least Goldman Sachs sees potential for a soft landing. So is this peak pessimism in this bond market? Yeah, it feels like, you know, with the way the CPI and PPI prints have come in recently, that we could be reaching the stage where we can start to talk about at least, you know, the rate hike pace slowing a bit. I think the famous pivot is still a few months away, but I think, you know, we could definitely see say 50 bips in December and, you know, slowing into next year. So it does feel like the curve will start to flatten and then markets, I think, will anticipate that and get ahead and probably start adding to risk. So do you want to chase this rally? Starks, yes, weaker yesterday, but in general, they are after lows. Yeah, I still think it feels a bit fragile at the moment. I don't think, you know, we'd be going all in and we're still leaning a bit underweight in equities right now. Okay. But I think we'd be looking for at least more confirmation from inflation. And one print doesn't kind of make a story. So we'd be looking for a bit more confirmation from inflation, although all the supply side indicators are definitely coming down. So it feels like the story, the pieces of the puzzle are definitely falling into place. One head scratcher of this cycle has been the default cycle. How steep will it be? We skipped it in COVID. Will we get it this time? I know you're still preferring investment grade over high yield. Do you expect some form of a default cycle this time around? I mean, we definitely see default rates picking up. We see distress rates picking up. So for us, it still is a much better risk reward to be an investment grade where you're still getting very decent yield versus high yield, where obviously you're getting a bit more, but we don't think the risk justifies adding that little bit of extra yield. So for us, you know, again, being more defensive, still waiting for a few more signals, we'd rather be an investment grade right now. But we don't foresee like a massive default cycle, you know, a global financial crisis. We think it will be relatively contained, but defaults will definitely pick up the protection we saw from COVID and the spending from governments. That's not going to be there anymore. November does feel like it's been marked by pivot stories, Fed being one, China being the other big one. And two potential risks this market has been trading on, easing or thawing of the U.S. tensions between the U.S. and China and some pivot on COVID zero. How much do you buy into those narratives? Is it time or is it too early to start trading them? Definitely on the pivot to COVID zero, we think it's still a bit too early. We'd be looking for March the end of the NPC in China for some decisive action on kind of ending COVID zero. But it does feel like the beginning of the end, I mean, you know, the Chinese have got, you know, very Chinese 20 point policy in place for easing COVID. On the geopolitical tensions, frankly, you know, they couldn't have got much worse. So I think some easing was always on the cards, but at the same time, I mean, the market shouldn't pretend that Biden is any less hawkish on China than his predecessors. But I wonder if you can trade a China that's less isolated. The fact that they've signed on to this communicate, which does condemn the war in Ukraine, is this a China where that risk of them pulling away from the global economy is at risk now diminished? I do think it's diminished. And I think what the last few months have made China realize is that they're stronger within the global economy than outside. Yes, they do want to pivot.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,119,2022-11-17 06:23:42
17506," I don't risk now, Dimonish. I do think it's Dimonish. And I think what the last few months have made China realises that they're stronger within the global economy than outside. Yes, they do want to pivot to a more domestically focused service-led economy, but they still realise that they need to be an exporter. They need external markets. So I think they're going to shift a bit more to recognising that they have a role within the international community and trying to foster that. Altoff, unfortunately, we're out of time. Not enough time with you. Come back, join us again. Altoff, Kassam. Amia Head of Investment Strategy and Research at State Street Global Advisors.

17507," In terms of sphere of influence, we absolutely know that China wants to be dominant in Asia. So there is a target to get to that point, to be a military that is appear to the greatest militaries in the world by 2035. The competition for influence is a global one. And through a multi-decade trajectory fueled by planning, money, and pragmatism, China is building a military that allows it to shape the 21st century just as the US shaped the 20th. Siemens expects higher margins in its three key divisions next year. Bloomberg's Tom McKenzie spoke to CEO Roland Bush after their earnings. We are very happy about our finish in Q4 and of course our fiscal year. We are on total we grew by 17% in order to intake in 8% in revenue. So this was a growth which came from all our businesses but also from the old markets. We still have a very strong demand. And if you go forward, obviously we are guiding even a little bit more bullish than last year. We are guiding our revenue to grow by 6 to 9%. We believe that this is again confirming that there is a strong demand for our portfolio. It is all about digitalization and sustainability. Again also about automation, automating, manufacturing, but also on the sustainability site which is energy efficiency which is electrification where we have a very strong portfolio, very strong demand. And this goes really across the regions and across our businesses. We see a leveling out in the order intake if you go forward, maybe even some decline, but you have to have in mind this is on an extremely high prior year level in our short cycle industries. So we have been concerned at all if that order intake goes down a bit because this allows us to shorten or delivery times to customers which I think is very important because we are sitting in such a huge backlog. And talking about this huge backlog, it is more than 100 billion. It gives us a good visibility in the next fiscal year which is a very good start in turn you. Okay. So more than 100 billion in terms of the order backlog. Where are you then in terms of converting that backlog into revenue? We have had a visibility out of that order backlog. We approximately see in the next fiscal year 40 billion of it. So it is a very high visibility. For mobility is even higher. There is a higher share of costs. As you can imagine 90% of the order backlog of mobility business is going to materialize in 2023. This is the nature of the business. So again, this is very good. It is an unusual high order backlog. And this is the reason why I am saying it is unusual, long delivery times. Which obviously we want to shorten to make our customers happy and our customers going. It is a good problem to have, obviously. And we are converting that into top line growth in the current fiscal year 2023. And you talked about the strength of the digital industries business. As you convert customers from software sales into cloud subscriptions, where are you in that transition? When do you expect that to complete? So we started in fiscal year 22 with this transition. We are very happy with our SaaS transition. We wanted to grow by 10%. We grew it by 15. So it is a very, very strong demand from our customers. And also our strategy plays out. This is number one, converting customers, which is on a high level. But also addressing no new customers, small and medium-sized customers. This is a particular offering for them. And we see a very, very high take from these small and medium-sized customers, new customers too. So we are very happy. And as we always said, if we can go faster with this transition, this SaaS transition of our software business, we would. And so we accelerated it. And it's a sincerely happy transition. You can actually create great opportunities, and we need to be really happy.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,121,2022-11-17 06:35:01
17508," said, if we can go faster, this transition, this transition of our software business, we would. And so we accelerated it. And we are now in the second year. And this is the, let's say the year where we have to take another strong momentum. In the third, we are believing that this whole thing is going to continue and then also our bottom line is picking up. How comfortable are you with the margins and the smart infrastructure division? And do you expect further expansion in those margins in the quarters ahead? Yes, I'm particularly happy with the development of smart infrastructure. Top line and bottom line. So we promised and we are continuously closing the gap, the profitability gap to our customers. We do that as promised. I'm very happy with the development of smart infrastructure in the fiscal year 2022. And going forward, we said we want in 2023 and this goes back to our capital market. Avis said we want to go above the 13%. We are going there. We are moving and improving our margins. They're continuously as a great show from our smart industry people. They're serving the market good. They have their cost under control and they're converting that top line growth into bottom line results. A very optimistic seamen CEO, their Roland Bush speaking to Bloomberg's Tom McKenzie after a strong earnings beat. Let me show you what the rest of the market is doing this morning. Ten year yields, those are moving higher, but that's after two days of declines, two days of buying treasuries that also saw the long end move lower while the front end moved higher. We've looked at that lead to the most inverted yield curve since the 1980s. It is a bond market that is ringing the recession alarm louder. China, though, is the other focus this morning. We're going to talk to Ann about jewelers about that in just a moment, but we are seeing COVID cases at their highest since April. All that demand concerned, not just playing out in the Chinese currency, but also oil as well. That's down 1.2% nine, X crude at just 84 and a half dollars, a barrel Brent. That is at paying at $92 a barrel. So it is a demand weakening story that's playing through there. But at the moment, some consolidation inequities after a decline of about 8-10th of 1% yesterday, S&P futures are higher. Let's take a dive on those Asia markets as I was just saying. Ann about jewelers is in Hong Kong for us with some of the big moves. Ann, by now, you're also looking at the tech space this morning. Yeah, that's right, Danny, because we had, of course, those earnings out from 10 cent here. We've brought in bright spots there, specifically in online ad sales, but still we did see that quarterly revenue drop. And then you can add to that as well, the company announcing plans to divest it's taken Mayt1. So we're seeing that here, particularly for Mayt1, that's the Chinese delivery giant. So that really did spark that broader internet sector sell off today for Chinese stocks, compounded as well by what happened with NetEase because that company confirming plans to end a 14 year partnership with Blizzard and they had been distributing titles like World of Warcraft, Starcraft in China for more than 10 years. So that is the picture for that today. But let's change on now. I go a little bit broader because we are seeing it generally equities in the red, really down to what you were saying that picture that we had in US retail sales better than expected. So more fed rate hikes still in store also being confirmed by what we heard from Fed officials. That dollar strength coming back in currency weakness there. And then as well those moves that we're seeing in the long duration debt space reflecting as well we had in treasuries in the previous session. And then of course Danny, that inversion that we see still in the Tuesdays. And about thank you very much. And about jewelers there in Hong Kong. Now also on the other side of the world from me is my co-anchor Manus Cranney in Singapore. Manus, great to see you. Day three of the Bloomberg new economy forum in Singapore. I mean, there is so much to talk about there whether it's geopolitics, whether it's the China story, whether it's the European economy. I mean, take your pick. It is a complicated environment for the world's leaders that you've been speaking to. Maybe the issue for markets is how do you position for an accelerated change in China? One of my guests this morning saying there was a pivot immediately after. Wha building shortage?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,122,2022-11-17 06:39:27
17509," The issue for markets is how do you position for an accelerated change in China? One of my guests this morning saying, look, there was a pivot immediately after the plan, after that 20th Congress and that pivot on housing, pivot on policy, will accelerate and they want to actively be exposed to China. But I think the narrative here is trying to unpick the new answers of the US-China relationship. Where are the red lines? We know that's in Taiwan. Kevin Rudd, the former Prime Minister of Australia, saying, neither of them want to go to war, because essentially they're both concerned about losing. And they're in line, looking for an off-ramp, how to avoid a war to quote Christenger and how to de-escalate from the current war. We'll be the narrative in just under 30 to 40, sorry, just under two hours. Zelensky will appear here as one of the closing conversations at the plenary session here. Also, there's a warning shot from the Singapore officials here, the permanent secretary, the former permanent secretary, saying, China is a formidable competitor, but if it's a competitor within the same system, and China may want to dominate that system. So again, it's a warning shot about that. But Danny, let's get to one of the big themes this year. It's been around the energy crisis in Europe and how we're grappling with that transition. It's been backdroped by war. Here's what some of the attendees at Bloomberg's any if summit had positive things to say, though. Aliens, however, let's listen in. Be carefully. And I am a born optimist, so I'll sort of look on the bright side of things. Because look at the fact that we're just launching our first LNG terminal, which was originally projected to only open after two years, and it's been a little over a year since we started. So we're very happy with the progress, but it's going to take time to rewire the energy infrastructure. And Germany is really dependent on stable, not just cheap energy. So we're going to see significant fall out in the restructuring of the industry. On the other hand, we're not going to see the industrialization Germany to the opposite. And I'll give you an analogy. When a few years ago, the Swiss franc floated against the euro and traded up almost 20%. I think I don't know what the number was. Everybody said, Switzerland is going to be the industrialized, and the opposite has happened. So we're going to do well. So you see companies moving in as opposed to moving out? No, it's not about that. It's about the fact that it spores really innovation. Yes, we may not be able to produce Amon Yak as a base chemical material in Germany at the current energy cost. But we have amazing companies, both small, medium-sized and large, that are going to use the opportunity of the energy transition to reinvent our business model and do just so much better. Ali, I'll see you there. Oliver Beats speaking with the team at the Blinberg New Economy Forum. Danny, I'm signing off from Singapore. Another plane right awaits me. We'll be back together actually. You're right next week. And I know that you've got a good conversation coming up with with Mark Moby. So I'm just curious to know whether he's a buyer of bonds, a buyer of duration. Does he agree with Pymco? You see, I'm never that far from a bond trade. Deep down. Manus. Manus, I mean, it is who you are to your core. I would be alarmed if you weren't. Manus, enjoy the rest of your travels. See you when I'm back after next week. Manus, Cranney, they're signing off at the New Economy Forum. And as Manus mentioned, coming up, we will be joined by Mark Mobius, founding partner at Mobius Capital. He'll be talking to us about China. Bond's as Manus says. And I might as well throw Manus's question. Shouldn't we? All of that next. This is Bloomberg. How much a good push have you seen from the Kishita Government?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,123,2022-11-17 06:43:33
17510," How much of a push have you seen from the Kishita government in terms of green funding? The Kishita administration has committed to doubling the amount of investments in so-called green technologies. I think we need more than just pronouncements. We need real money backing, very innovative startups and innovative companies in this space. What do you make of Kishita's new capitalism? Well, I think he is framework is reflective of the challenges that Japan society is facing, namely that growth has been present, but growth has not been, of course, evenly distributed. But frankly speaking, it's hard to redistribute income if you don't have much income to begin with. If the government and private sector can work together and collaborate to drive more innovative growth startups, that can really drive the income growth that the Kishita government needs to redistribute. Now, one of the big stories this week amid a lot of big stories has been the return of present Xi Jinping to the world stage at the G20 summit in Bali. A lot to dig through to help us do that. We're joined now by Mark Mobius founding partner at Mobius Capital Partners in expert on China and the EM space. Mark, thanks so much for joining us. So look, we are coming off the back of a G20 notable with a Biden Xi meeting that was really lauded for a potential easing of tensions. Does it go anywhere to diffuse tensions between the world's two biggest economies? No, not really. And I'm very disappointed at the G20 meetings because they really didn't attack the key issues. And that is the threat by China to take Taiwan by force. And what's happening in Europe and Ukraine? These are two key issues which seem to be ignored or at least skirted around in the meetings. So I think it's a real problem for investors like ourselves, because you consider China being such a big market, such an important role in global economies. If we invest there, is there risk that we have the same thing that we had with Russia when Ukraine bought broke out and we weren't able to get money out of Russia? So this is something that we have to address as investors very, very carefully. Mark, so do you write off then China, for example, signing off on the communique that said most members strongly condemned the war in Ukraine and the fact that Xi was there talking to various world partners? Is this not a Xi who wants to avoid diplomatic isolation? He has no choice. He's got to make sure that China is engaged and trade around the world because if you look at the Chinese economy, it's dependent upon trade particularly with the US and Europe. So he really has no choice but to engage with these leaders and say nice words. But at the end of the day, you must remember that he's threatened to take Taiwan by force and that would be, it would mean war with the United States in my view. How real is that risk, do you think, Mark? Well, I think it's very real. It's very clearly stated, it may not happen overnight but I think it's something hanging over our heads. The solution, of course, would be for Xi to come out and say look, we would like to have a combination with Taiwan but we will never use force. It would be up to the Taiwanese people. That would be a great statement to make and it would relax the investors around the world and people will want to go back into China. Well given the very complicated geopolitics, the risks you...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,124,2022-11-17 06:47:52
17511," the investors around the world and people will want to go back into China. Well given the very complicated geopolitics, the risks you see of escalation, Mark, do you want to touch anything? Are you willing to touch any investment in China or given that risk? Is it uninvestable? We are investing in a company in Hong Kong, which is bought of China, of course, now. So that's the some degree risk control in the sense that we've limited the amount that we have in China. So we're not ignoring it completely, but to put, let's say, the market weight, you must remember the emerging market's indices have 20-30% in China. We certainly never want to go to that high degree. So I think this is something that we have to watch carefully and limit and put the money into Taiwan. I think that's where the opportunities are and we think there's a better chance there, particularly in companies that are doing software where they can move. I was just about to go there, Mark, because we had warned Buffett pouring about $5 billion into TSMC. Is that the type of trade you're interested in? Exactly. Well, we're more interested in, we've been interested in the last three, four years in companies in Taiwan that are doing the software, the design for semiconductors, that TSMC manufacturers. So they depend on TSMC for the manufacturers side, but they're doing the software. The good news for these companies is that they can move anywhere in the world. If something happens in Taiwan, they can move to the United States, they can move to Europe and say Pabins and people can move as well. So that's the way we sort of control the possible risk of an attack on Taiwan by China. The other Chinese thread here and really why we've seen a big rally in these Chinese equity, equity is Mark, has been the hope of a reopening story, the reduction of COVID-0 policies. Is that a narrative you think has legs, Mark? Definitely. Definitely has legs. China has to open up because they cannot continue these lockdown policies if they want to have growth. You must remember, she needs to have growth in the economy in order to make people happy at the end of the day. The Communist Party, even though they control the economy, needs to have growth in order to get the support of the general population. So yes, they will be opening up. The economy will recover to some degree. Of course, they're never going to reach the 10 percent growth that they had 10 years ago, but they'll be growing at say 1, 2, 3 percent. And not the kind of growth that India now is experiencing, but they will definitely recover it. And the market will recover as well. Mark, in the past, you've said that you used crypto as a signal, or it's a useful signal for this overall market environment. So what signal do you take from the collapse of FDX, the collapse of a once trusted exchange and the ripple effects we're seeing from that? It's a terrible situation. So millions of people around the world. I don't think central banks and government officials around the world already recognized the degree to which people are involved in crypto. Just before this call, I got a call from a friend who had money in one of the crypto exchanges, and they were guaranteeing him 5 percent. He decided to take money out and they say, oh, sorry, we're close. We cannot redeem your money. I mean, this is the kind of thing that's happening globally. And it's not good. And it's not good for a market. So we are in a recession, but for people being in the crypto space, millions of people, it's more recession. It's really disaster. They're losing their savings. Can trust come back to this space, Mark, or are we permanently scarred when it comes to crypto investments? And someone like your friends, you were talking to, the scars of this, what will this do to investor sentiment, to the viability of crypto going forward, especially for institutional investors?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,125,2022-11-17 06:52:16
17512," Scars of this, what will this do to investor sentiment, to the viability of crypto going forward, especially for institutional investors? Well, you know, when people ask me about crypto, I always say that I don't like to talk about religion in public because it's a religion, it's a belief. And there's a whole generation of people, let's say below 30 years of age, who have grown up with the internet and believe in the internet. So that's fine. There's faith in the crypto and there will still be many people that believe in crypto, but it's really taken a hard knock. And I think there is a future for crypto for the transfer of money illicitly. Now, when I say illicitly, I don't mean something evil because money transfers, let's say out of dictatorship, might be a good thing for people who are trying to escape. So I think there's a role for crypto in those kinds of transfers. Right. And Mark, I know you've talked about that specifically in the context of Russia and the past as well. Mark, I got to leave you here. We don't have too much time, but quickly I want to get your thoughts. Some of this inflation trade has been unwinding. Dollar coming off its high stocks off its lows. Do you want to follow that trade that pivot of high inflation? I think we're still going to have relatively high inflation, 7-8% going forward. But the Fed, I think, and central banks are going to be very cautious about raising interest rates anymore because of the recession problem. We're in a recession, but it could get worse. So I think central banks will be very careful, but we're not over. And if you look at things like food and fuel, the increases have been tremendous. They're really hitting the lower income people very, very badly. So this is a real problem. Wait, Mark, just literally 10 seconds here. You said in the past that we need to hike rates above inflation. Do you still think that should be the case? What level? Yes, it will have. I mean, if central banks really want to kill inflation, they have to raise interest rates above their rate of the CPI. But if the CPI goes down, which it seems to be heading, then they will not be able to and they will not want to raise rates to that degree. Okay, Mark. Thank you so much. Mark Mobius, founding partner at Mobius Capital Partners. Always a pleasure to catch up with you. Coming up, we're going to talk crypto and the FTX contagion. That's next. This is Bloomberg. Today's CFOs are reshaping the C-suite. Bloomberg's Chief Future Officer shines a spotlight on these dynamic leaders. Today's CFO has to be much, much more than a bookkeeper. One of the most important things is looking around the corner. We have to let go of the traditional legacy department store.

The odds have to be credible business leaders in order to really impact the business and skills of our industry. We are like biologists. We need to deeply understand the financial DNA of the company. People just come with a playbook and say, okay, we're going to roll that. Don't do that. Pink long term. I think to be successful in a role like these, it is not only technical knowledge.

17513," Every week, you need to get set for the start of US trade-off. Bloomberg, the Oakland with Jonathan Tarrough. Drilling down in the numbers and preparing you as only Bloomberg can. weekdays on Bloomberg. There was not surprise that the volatility and even the turmoil in the price of crypto has been extended to the trading platforms. I was surprised about how rapid this has happened. The ECB Vice President, Louis Gindos, is speaking about the crypto turmoil. We're just talking to Mark Mobius about it as well. Re-saying the frame, he said sometimes that crypto is more of a religion than an investment. Now, is that what more folks are thinking considering we've seen Bitcoin that rest the crypto space so far off of its highs? The latest you have, some of this contagion spreading to Gemini, spreading to the Vincolvoss twins of crypto exchange. They have halted with draws. At the same time, we've had some tweets coming from Sam Bankman-Fried saying that, look, he was mistaken about FTX's leverage levels. I mean, he continues to just tweet through this, also saying that he was overconfident or the company as a whole was overconfident and careless. So the drama continues and we continue to monitor the spill over contingent risks. Coming up next, it's Bloomberg Markets Europe. This is Bloomberg. I'm going to name a couple of your babies. I don't know if I'm asking you to choose amongst your children, but some of the most recognizable buildings by you, of course, the Millennium Bridge, London City Hall, the Reichstag, and the Great Court British Museum. What was your favorite project to do? The Reichstag does stand out because, first of all, it's an energy manifesto. So it transforms something that was dependent on fossil fuels that uses all the technology to produce something which is essentially carbon neutral and there's a public building. That's a statement. It's a symbol of a city, a symbol of a nation. It incorporates works of art. It's recycling and existing building which, as I mentioned earlier, is the ultimate in sustainability. If you can get a new life to a building, it also creates public space at the roof level. It's the most visited parliament in the world, so it puts the public above the politicians who are answerable to them. And that, of course, was made possible by the politicians.

17514," So it's a demonstration of democracy in action. It's really a reminder, isn't it, just how sensitive the markets are to any commentary about trade. We did see suppression in the U.N., we did see suppression in the future. That is now being reversed. Good morning. Welcome to Bimbeb Market, Sierra Pai Manor Edwards live in London. The cash trade is just less than an hour away. Here are your top headlines. Led down by tech, Asia stocks follow Wall Street into the red as a sell-off in Chinese technology shares intensifies. The dollar snaps are to day decline. US Republicans flip the house by a narrow margin giving the GOP power to thwart President Biden's agenda in the second half of his term. And face into the storm, UK Chancellor Jeremy Hunt delivers his highly anticipated budget statement today, seeking to stabilize the public finances amid economic headwinds. Welcome to the programme, everybody. Let's have a look at the breaking news at 7 o'clock here in London. We're just getting the European car registration numbers coming through. European car sales rising by 14% in the month of October from a record low a year ago. This puts recovery in its third month. So we've seen three months of quite decent gains since that turning point in August. Supply chain issues, perhaps at the margin, getting a little bit easier. But just as that happens, just as things ease up on one area of headwind, we have perhaps into another one concerns really about the slowdown in the European economy. The role of higher energy costs in that, of course, very key. So that's where we are on the auto space. We'll certainly keep an eye on old car stocks at the start of trade. Now, it just sounds an hour away from the cash equity trading session here in Europe. So let's look at the futures picture. And yesterday was a really negative session for European markets and US markets. It seems we've been fretting once again about Fed tightening. So Euro stocks 50 futures looking to draw a bit of a line in the sand perhaps. Looking kind of tentative though in those gains up by two tenths of 1% FTSE futures down a tenth of a percent. US futures look a little bit warmer, a little bit stronger up by four tenths of 1% on E-minis. Now, that futures up a half a percent. Yesterday, I mentioned we were back to worrying about Fed tightening. And that was driven once again by the data. So away from that peak inflation debate that we've seen over CPI and then over PPI. Yesterday, we were really concerned about where how long we continue to see strength in the US consumer. Despite negative numbers out of target, we saw the biggest increase in eight months in retail sales. And so that once again underlining the work still to be done at the Fed plus comments from Walla doing that as well. That said, US futures, as you can see there on the screen, do look pretty positive as they set up about half a percent on Nasak futures. Onto the GMM then. This is what we see through the Asia session. We are weaker on Asia stocks down by seven tenths of 1% six sorry on the MSCI Asia Pacific. But that's off earlier lows. It is a negative theme though coming from China that is dominating things. A China stock sell off in particular around tech stocks were at the weakest in two weeks on China tech. That had been an area that had been sensitive to some of the latest commentary and some of the opening up commentary that we've seen from China. And we've seen of course reports around the property sector as well. But this is being driven by 10 cents, the internet giant pulling back from some of its investments and that underlining the negatives and the threats to Chinese tech stocks. We're also keeping an eye on what the PBOC has been saying around inflation. So that's the picture on the GMM some of that weighing on stocks, weighing on the Chinese currency. You can see the Remmin be down three or four tenths of a percent. Let's get on to the UK politics story, which is set to dominate perhaps here in Europe today. UK Chancellor Jeremy Hunt delivers his autumn statement today as he wrestles with inflation at 11.1% in the year to October. That is the highest in more than four decades. There are numerous challenges facing the economy with the former Bank of England NPC member Michael Saunders saying Brexit's impact still looms large. The UK economy as a whole has been permanently damaged by Brexit. It's reduced the economy's potential output significantly, eroded business investment.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,128,2022-11-17 07:05:23
17515," Economy as a whole has been permanently damaged by Brexit. It's reduced the economy's potential output significantly, eroded business investment. I would look if we hadn't had Brexit, we probably wouldn't be talking about an austerity budget this week. The need for tax rises, spending cuts, wouldn't be there if Brexit hadn't reduced the economy's potential output so much. We probably won't hear the UK Government make that kind of commentary today. What will we hear from the UK Government? Let's explore that with Bloomberg's UK correspondent Lizzie Burton, who is in Westminster, braving the cold for us. Lizzie, good morning. Give us the big picture, then. What do we expect from this fiscal statement today, which is basically a budget? It is basically a budget, Anna, and what we're expecting is austerity on steroids. Much of this autumn statement has been briefed already, so as not to shock the markets, that straight out of Rishasunak's playbook from when he was chancellor. But the new chancellor has said we're going to have eye-wateringly difficult decisions when it comes to tax rises and spending cuts, because he's got to plug the hole in the public finances, tame inflation, and grow the economy. Now, he's walking a tightrope between pleasing the markets on the one hand and pleasing voters on the other. But what's different between this fiscal statement and the mini-budget in September is that the forecaster, the office for budget responsibility, will provide its economic outlook alongside the statement later. Now, although much of it has been briefed, there is much still to find out. We want to know what the balance will be between tax rises and spending cuts. Who is going to suffer the tax rises? Jeremy Hunt says he's going to hit the wealthiest, the hardest. Who's going to get the support? How much of the fiscal squeeze is going to be backloaded after the 2024 general election? And the degree to which he overcompensates for the fiscal gap in case growth underwhelms. Michael Saunders there suggested perhaps it will. OK, thanks very much, Lizzie Brunberg. Lizzie Berden, in the call for us in Westminster, of course, keeping us all up to date with all the developments as we work our way towards the autumn statement. Stay tuned for our coverage of the autumn statement, our special programming. Well, we'll have guests throughout the morning, of course, but we'll have a special focus on this at 9.30 a.m. UK time will bring you the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt's statement later this morning when we get it as well. Joining us now, let's pick up in our conversation on this theme, Patrick Armstrong, clearly wealth, CIO is with us, Patrick, very nice to have you with us. We will broaden our conversation into other areas of the global economy and investment strategy, of course. But we are on mini budget day or autumn statement day, but it is basically like a budget. So many trial balloons sent up, so much pitch rolling has gone on. You can open a newspaper or listen to the radio or the TV in the past four, two weeks without a lot of lead in to this autumn statement. What are you going to be watching for? What does an investor watch for today? I don't think there's going to be much surprising. There's going to be higher taxes. It's going to be focused on the wealthy spending cuts. They're going to be limited right now. Maybe a broadening of windfall taxes. But the one thing, there's a lot of things working against the UK right now, but the one thing that's going for it is nominal growth is going to be strong, not because real economic growth is strong, but because inflation is high. And that actually greases the wheels that tax rates, tax revenues come in when you're generating no growth because nominal growth is strong. So inflation causes a lot of problems, but it's one part of the fix that governments have right now. OK, that's an interesting perspective on it. And where does that leave you on UK assets, Patrick? I'm not a big fan of UK assets, because real growth is going to be non-existent. Bank of England's forecasting pretty much two years of recession and subdued growth. And I do still prefer the mega-caps, the multinationals. I like oil and gas companies in a portfolio. The healthcare companies, I think, are very stable revenues and defendable profit margins. So the FTSE 100, to me, much better place to be than the FTSE 250. And I think sticking with equity strategy, we've seen a number of drivers, different macro drivers in the last few days, that have led to optimism. Not yesterday, yesterday we were all back to worrying about the Fed and tightening again. But over recent weeks, of course, we've seen inflation, the conversation around peaking inflation in the United States. We've seen better move music out of the G20. We've seen a pivot on China, COVID policy, at least a little. How far can these things take us in terms of a stock rally? I don't, the only reason they've pushed us so far so...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,129,2022-11-17 07:09:45
17516," We've seen a pivot on China COVID policy at least a little. How far can these things take in terms of a stock rally? I don't... The only reason they've pushed us so far so quickly already, over the last week, you've seen the equities really shoot higher, is they've removed some of the tailwrestth. The Fed was on a pace of hiking that maybe they couldn't slow and then the low CPI print came out and the 50 basis points is now, I think, the base case for everyone in December, whereas before the print 75 was a plausible outcome. China invading Taiwan, it's not off the table, it's not on the table necessarily, it does seem that there's a chance for a thawing of relations between the US and China following the G20. So again, it doesn't set the stage for growth, but it does remove some of the tailwrestth about things getting worse a little bit. It shows that there's a dialogue and a constructive atmosphere anyway. So I don't think this sets a sustainable rally, but it does calm investors' nerves, and investors were incredibly nervous. If you look at investor positioning, the sustainable bear surveys, those kind of things, end of September, you've never seen a more bearish investor backdrop. Okay, so everyone was really bearish. You get some removal of tailwrestth and at the margin, that leaves space for risk assets to rally. I know we talked about energy stocks. I know that luxury is also something that you own right now. And I'm just drawn to some headlines from Burberry, retail comparable sales up by 5%, the estimate was 4.7, so a little bit higher. But interesting what they're saying about China, COVID-19 related disruptions in mainland China still in issue, it seems. So we're also talking about now about recessionary risks in Europe and the Americas. I mean, what is driving you toward luxury right now? It's the consumer. So basically, the low-end consumer is having their purse, a pinch basically, by higher energy prices, utility bills, petrol prices, mortgage costs, the affluent consumer, the high-end consumer. Those things are almost irrelevant to them, so I think their spending power is going to be much stronger, and the profit margins on luxury companies are incredibly high. So input prices don't create a margin squeeze on luxury companies where they do on lower-end retail. So those things, I think, really favor luxury companies versus mass market retail. The strong dollar has helped with a lot of Americans buying up luxury against it, seems in Europe as well on holiday. Thank you very much, Patrick. Stay with us a little bit longer on the program, Patrick Hanson, Polarimi Wealth, CIO. We will see him later on this hour. Coming up shortly, FTX contagion hits the Winklevoss twins through a liquidity squeeze at their lending partner, Genesis. Up next, though, we will have more on the UK Chancellor's Jeremy Hans highly anticipated budget statement as he seeks to stabilize the public finances amid economic headwinds. We will get the view at the IFS. What are they going to be looking for today? If you have any questions for our guests, please do send them to us. I'd be plus T. V. Go is the function to use. He's going back. I'm going to ask you a question. Why is everybody want to be a consultant? And what are all these consultants doing? Well, David, I think that we actually defy the label consultant because sometimes consultants seem to imply that we only give advice. And when you look at what Accenture does, we're really different than the traditional version of a consultant. We're really about relevance and results. And that's what is driving our business. What about a consulting project? In my example, on the CEO, I have a problem. I call you up. I say, solve my problem or give me a solution. We don't operate as big companies permanently in crisis mode. And so when you think about how long does it solve things, a lot of it starts with, you know, the company being willing to set aggressive goals. And so what we are trying to do now is work with our clients to work differently and to work faster. Our clients help us more, we're asking questions to our employees, who are clients or dog machines? What kind of support get your employees to participate in this?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,130,2022-11-17 07:14:14
17517," BIGBIC Panama cin and the program. I think it will probably be appropriate soon to move to a slower pace of increases, but we have additional work to do. Nobody covers the fed like Bloomberg. Welcome back to Blue Bed Market Europe. We still have 45 or so minutes to go until the songs of cash equity trading and the 1,500 futures picture looks pretty flat elsewhere looking for some gains at the start of trade after a negative session weighed down by fear about higher interest rates in the United States. Let's get a Bloomberg first Wednesday's update for you. Top stories we're covering globally. Here's Alice Atkins. Good morning, Alice. Morning Anna. The People's Bank of China is warning inflation may accelerate as overall demand and the economy picks up. Analyst said the comments suggest the central bank could be shifting its focus away from adding more stimulus to the country. Chinese regulators, meanwhile, said to have asked commercial banks to report on their ability to meet short term obligations. This after a risk on mood to a rapid bomb sell-off to bring a flood of withdrawals from fixed income products. Republicans have one control of the US House of Representatives but by far slim margin than predicted. AP reports that the party now has the 218 seats for a majority after a win in a district in California. Despite concerns about Biden's handling of the economy, voters delivered a split verdict over who was to blame with issues such as abortion rights and threats to democracy also in focus. Xi Jinping has confronted Canada's Justin Trudeau at the G20 summit accusing him of leaking details of a private meeting. In an exchange, court-owned camera, China's president spoke through a translator, appearing to read the report. The report says that the government's first meeting of the US House of Representatives and the US House of Representatives spoke through a translator, appearing to reprimand Trudeau for leaking their conversations to the newspapers. Blue will use 20-brows a day on air and on Bloomberg Quicktake, powered by more than 2700 journalists and analysts in more than 120 countries. This is Bloomberg, Anna. Thanks very much, Alice. Now back to the UK politics and UK economy. The UK Chancellor Jeremy Hunt is set to deliver his highly anticipated budget statement today. It comes as the country wrestles with inflation at its highest level in more than four decades. Joining us now, Karl Emerson, deputy director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Karl, very nice to have you with us. Thank you for coming to talk to us on Bloomberg TV. I read my colleagues are writing overnight that we are expecting spending cuts to represent 60% of what the government is doing here. Tax increases, 40%, that seems to be the balance that we're looking for. In terms of those tax increases, I want to ask you about that. Where do you think the biggest amounts of money will come from in this budget? Is it going to be about fiscal drag, taxing, energy production companies, capital gains tax? Where are you focused? It does seem quite striking that in the past when a UK Chancellor is needed to do a big fiscal tightening and a big tax rise. What he has tended to do is essentially pick one of the main tax rates and push it up. So the variator of VAT or the rate of national insurance has been the favourite one. In this autumn statement, it sounds like a right-winged one. It sounds like we are having a big tax rise, but it's going to come from perhaps lots and lots and lots of smaller measures. So freezing many tax allowances, so the point of which people start to pay income tax, the point of which people start to pay higher rate tax, freezing, for example, limits on pension contributions, freezing the point of which people start to pay inheritance tax. Some explicit tax rise is too possibly cussing the annual allowance for capital gains tax and also lots of speculation that the point of which people pay the highest rate of tax in the UK, the 45 p-rate that Liz tried to get rid of. This room is that one kicking at £150,000 a year. Elinsteb kicking at £125,000 a year. So it sounds like lots and lots of moderate tax rises, rather than one big one. Okay. Okay.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,131,2022-11-17 07:18:33
17518," £1,000 a year, ill instead kick in at £125,000 a year. So it sounds like lots of larger tax rises, rather than one big one. OK, so we'll be watching those thresholds then and seeing what kind of creep we get on those, on the spending cut side of things, Carl. How interested you in the profiling of the spending cuts when they are set to be implemented? Because the market will be keenly focused on this, of course, and balancing the budget more broadly. But there'll be a big difference, I imagine, in many people's eyes between commitments that are made ahead of the next election and those that are made after. I think that's precisely right. And I think actually that's perhaps the hardest judgment for Jeremy Hunt, to what extent does he need to do spending cuts or indeed tax rises relatively swiftly in order to provide kind of insurance that he's really serious about taking physical sustainability as a very important matter to give that credibility and that reassurance to the markets. But of course, if you undo do that, that's problematic. You end up with interest rate rises, it's usually costly. But if you overdo it, you do damage to the economy, damage to the public finances, but damage to public spending is just not necessary. So the alternative is to use what credibility you've got to say, actually, I will pencil in spending cuts for three, four, five years time, maybe penciling in some tax rises too, but hope that things turn out better than you expect and perhaps you won't need to do it. And that nimble approach, given the uncertainty, might not be the wrong thing to do as long as you can take markets with you. There's been a lot of focus, of course, on what markets have wanted, I suppose, and those who lend to the UK government and to the UK economy car. But thinking about what we in the UK want in terms of tax and spending and the size of the public sector, you can, when you think about this, I suppose, you can fall back on your own politics, you can look at polling data about what the UK public wants in terms of tax and spend. And you can also think about what might be in the best interests of the UK economy and try and have some sort of objective view. Is there anything you can add to that conversation from that perspective? Well, I think in terms of thinking about the trade off between tax and spend, I think it's important to remember that the UK tax burden is firstly very high by UK standards already. So even if the chance of didn't put up taxes, we think it would probably be running at about the highest level the UK has ever sustained in its history. So that might point you to say, well, it's difficult to put it up further. But of course, there are successful economies in Western Europe and Scandinavia that have much higher tax burdens enough. So there is scope to go for more tax if that's what we choose to do. And I think the very much is a political choice about, you know, we do need to get debt on a falling path over the medium term. That's not a choice. But there are choices about the extent to which you want to push up taxes and which taxes and the extent to which you want to trim back on those spending plans to achieve that. OK, and thinking about some of the other dynamics, dynamics in the UK economy that might be having an impact here, Karl, we had an interview with Michael Saunders at the Bank of England who's quite outspoken on the links that he sees between Brexit and the tough choices that the UK government is having to make here. Of course, I'm sure the government has a different interpretation of that. But thinking about this through the labour market, do you expect anything to be done, any announcements to be made, any changes around the labour market that would ease things on that front? Because other countries around the world are also suffering post-COVID from tight labour markets. But there's an ad in UK dimension here. The UK certainly struggling with its labour market, it's seeing, for example, large numbers of older people who we think probably would have been in work had the pandemic not happened, choosing to leave the labour market earlier. And the reasons for that are not fully understood. It doesn't look to us like it's explained by them being in poor health. It does look like something else has gone on, perhaps something around, maybe they saw their pension fund go up a lot during the pandemic and now that you can access that in the UK, they want to access it and facilitate an earlier retirement. Maybe they tried working from home, perhaps they were furloughed and all of a sudden that jumped to retirement didn't seem so scary. So maybe lots of different reasons, but it's certainly causing problems in the labour market. I mean, fundamentally what the chancellor is grappling with here is a world where we are poorer as a country than what we hope to be. And that makes all these trade us harder. And we are poorer because European gas prices are high and we import gas. We're also poorer than what we would be. Had we not done Brexit? If we are poorer, should we still be doing big ambitious infrastructure projects as planned? Those who argue for them say we need them bit to...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,132,2022-11-17 07:22:42
17519," If we are poor, should we still be doing big ambitious infrastructure projects as planned? Those who argue for them say we need them to shore up future growth and they're about efficiency and productivity. Others say that's the kind of thing that should be cut back on. What would your view and your guidance be around big infrastructure? If we're trying to get the deficit down and tax rises don't look very easy to do. Cutting day-to-day public service spending doesn't look very easy to do. Cutting the benefit payments we give to working age people or state pension payments doesn't look easy either. The thing will left with this investment spending. There's always a suspicion that politicians are too quick to cut that. That they're keen or uncutting investment spending. It's just politically easier to do than cutting day-to-day spending. There is an economic case that says, well, actually, interest rates are higher now than we expected back in March. We know it interest rates are higher when the government can't borrow on quite such favorable terms. The case for doing investment spending won't be quite so strong. Some of those more marginal projects perhaps do fall a bit closer to the line than what they might have been expected to do back in March. Thanks so much, Karl. Thanks for your input. Karl Emerson, Deputy Director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies. We'll of course have full coverage of the autumn statement later on today. Coming up on this program, FTX Contagion hits the Vincolvoss twins through a liquidity squeeze at their lending partner, Genesis. Is this the next fallout from FTX? We'll get some analysis of the latest on crypto. Also, don't miss our interview with the Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky. He will be speaking at the Bloomberg New Economy Forum. That is an event taking place in Singapore for the last three days. We'll bring you that conversation later on today. This is Bloomberg. China's military power has been growing at an incredible speed over the last 20 years. A strong country must have a strong military, as only then can it guarantee the security of the nation. In terms of sphere of influence, we absolutely know that China wants to be dominant in Asia. So there is a target to get to that point, to be a military that is appear to the greatest militaries in the world by 2035. The competition for influence is a global one. And through a multi-decade trajectory fueled by planning, money, and pragmatism, China is building a military that allows it to shape the 21st century just as the US shaped the 20th. Welcome back to Bloomberg, Markis, Europe, at 35 minutes until the start of cash-eckery trading. Let's focus in on the crypto story, the fallout from the rapid collapse of FTX. It's spreading across the crypto world, ensnaring the billionaire Vincolvose twins, perhaps through a liquidity squeeze at their lending partner, Genesis. Joining us now is Bloomberg's Souvashri, goes with the latest. What are the contagion risks on rambling now? Bring us up to date. Sure, thanks. So basically, after FTX is unraveling, the contagion risks are really flying, taking fast. So we've seen now that Genesis, the crypto-breed.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,133,2022-11-17 07:27:01
17520," Basically, after FTX is unraveling, the contagion risks are really flying thick and fast. So we've seen now that Genesis, the crypto brokerage, they have halted withdrawals. They have about $175 million of their derivatives business on FTX and that is stuck there. So as a result, once they have halted their lending partner, which is Gemini, as you said, their vehicle was twins owned Gemini, that's a crypto exchange, even that is under pressure. Now they have a own product, which is about $700 million invested in Genesis. And that they have halted the withdrawals from there. So we can see how the spillover risks are moving from one sector to the other sector in the same digital world. Now, after this has happened, Gemini is, again, under pressure for the whole exchange is seeing a lot of withdrawals. We've seen about $400 million, rather $500 million of the withdrawal from the entire Gemini exchange. That's going on there because of the concerns. Okay, Shivashri, thank you very much. Shivashri goes with the latest on crypto. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is $16,550, not moving all that far away from that mark. And certainly the $16,000 handle over the last few days. Coming up on the program, we'll get back to the UK economic story. The Chancellor Jeremy Hunt delivers his highly anticipated budget statement today. This is Blaineberg. It just seemed like I wasn't getting enough blood to my head. I was so dizzy all the time. More than 200 symptoms are attributed to long COVID, including exhaustion, rapid heart rate and other bewildering symptoms. It affects 140 million people around the world. Lisa is one of them. I couldn't work my job as a physician. I couldn't really be a mom. So it was a big change to go from defining yourself as a doctor and a mom to not having either of those defining you anymore. Harvard economist David Cutler puts the cost of long COVID at $3.7 trillion in the US alone. Long COVID is likely multiple different diseases under the same umbrella. If we bunch everything together, it's too complex. And so we can't even identify the right patients for right therapy. We've done a remarkable job in developing vaccines at record time. We need to replicate a lure from that success. And replicate that success in the long COVID research arena. We've only just begun to scratch the surface and understanding COVID's lasting effects. What's clear already is that the consequences of this viral disease will be vast and enduring unless scientists find ways to mitigate them. A multi-trillion dollar industry, there's a lot of ground to cover. The modernies got absolutely crushed. Who'd show you what's happening in ETFs like no one else?

17521," ETF RQ Monday on Bloomberg. This is Wilberg daybreak, but like, Bloomberg way. Welcome to daybreak Australia. It is Canada, the close welcome to Bloomberg crypto. Welcome back to Bloomberg Monkeys, Europe. We still have half an hour to go until the start of cash equity straighting here are your top stories. Led down by tech, Asia stocks, follow wall streets into the red as a cell of in Chinese technology shares intensifies. The dollar snaps a two day decline. US Republicans flip the house by a narrow margin giving the GOP power to thwart President Biden's agenda in the second half of his term. And face into the storm UK Chancellor Jeremy Hunt delivers his highly anticipated budget statement today, seeking to stabilize the public finances amid economic headwinds. Welcome back to the program. Everybody it is 7 30 in London, so half an hour until equity markets start trading. And you can see that the European market picture looks a little tentative in London, fairly flat in fact. London has been going its own way in recent sessions. The DAX and the CAC, though, looking for a little bit more upside perhaps. As US features also look stronger, up three, four tenths of a percent on e-minis and Nasek futures. Now, half an hour until equity market trading, a little bit longer than that until we hear from the UK Chancellor, let's think about what we can expect, what the bond markets are expecting and talk to our colleague Valerie Ty-Tel, who joins me. What has caught her eye on the UK front and Valerie. Of course, whilst we listen to the spending and tax plans that the Chancellor is going to announce later on today, everybody who operates in the guilt market is closely going to be watching how much borrowing is required, how much issuance. Yes, that's right, Anna, the guilt remit update we get today could cause some waves, but something caught my eye from Bloomberg earlier this week. It was there. There's survey of the guilt remit estimates from 10 big banks across the street. And the one thing to note from the survey is that it's only declined by 5 percent since those shocking numbers in September, meaning that under Hunt, we're still expecting the same amount of borrowing. Not only that, analysts from city expect the number to be over 250 billion of borrowing for the next three years running, showing that it's not just going to be about this year's borrowing, but look, we have to take into account this is going to be two, three, four years of high borrowing from the UK government. Now, that being said, we're in a different risk taking environment at the moment. We're seeing things like US inflation is cooling, which is causing the dollar to soften yields to rally a bit in the US, which means that this kind of borrowing maybe won't shock the market as aggressively as it did back in September. But look, Anna, the UK's debt to GDP is nearing 100 percent. We know we're on the verge of a recession. The Buoys clearly warning about that. And government accounts tend to deteriorate during a recession. So yes, maybe this is a better environment for the UK to be announcing this kind of issuance, but they should be mindful that this issue isn't going to go away. And there's glaring problems of the UK going forward. Okay, the issue with issuance then will certainly keep an eye on that. Well, a Valerie, as we listen to Jeremy Hunt and all he has to say about tax spending and levels of debt, of course. Now, let's get a blue bag business flash at some of the top corporate stories that we're covering. But I'm going to focus on crypto his Alice. Hi, Anna, former FDX CEO, Sam Balkan Freed has used a series of tweets to put his side of the story of the collapse of the crypto exchange he founded. He also admitted a mistake on leverage levels at FDX, which he thought were $5 billion rather than 13 billion. Separately, crypto platform Demonye Trust says its exchange is fully back online after it had earlier paused the draws on its lending program. LinkedIn CEO says he's gearing up for growth in some developing markets, even as the social networking site prepares for economic headwinds by pausing hiring. Speaking on the sidelines of the Bloomberg New Economy Forum in Singapore, Ryan Roslansky says India has become the company's fastest growing market. We're seeing a lot of growth and strength, like I said in India, but also across Indonesia, Western Europe, Syria is strong for us, and then engagement-wide, we're seeing a lot of engagement from Gen Z job seekers.

17522," Made a final order blocking the Chinese takeover of microchip factory Newport Waffer Fab, citing a national security risk. The deal will be unwound more than a year after it was signed with Chinese owned next-period forced to sell at least 86% of its stake in the plant. Newport Waffer Fab is the UK's biggest chip factory. That's Yblumberg Business Flash, Anna. Thanks very much, Alice Alice, that ends in London with your business flash. Now back to the UK story, Chancellor of the Extracurgery, Jeremy Hunt has set to deliver that highly anticipated budget statements later on today. Then opposition parties, of course, get their chance to respond. What are they going to be watching for? Let's get to Blumberg's UK correspondent, Lizzie Burden, who's in Westminster with a guest who can shed some light on that subject. Lizzie. Thank you, Anna. I'm joined by Alice and Thuleys, who is economic spokeswoman for the SNP and also a member of the Treasury Select Committee. Alice, thanks so much for joining me. This budget is to fix trussonomics, which was widely accepted as a disaster, but there is a gaping hole in the public finances. How do you fill it? I think it's important to recognise the scale of the damage. It says to be 30 billion pounds worth of damage that trussonomics has caused, and the Chancellor will have a lot of work to do to try and put that right. What we think is there are more options for the Chancellor to bring money into the coffers. We've looked at what Canada and America have done with a share buy-back scheme, which could potentially, according to the IPPR, bring a living billion pounds into the coffers. You also could look at things like taxing, non-doms, for example, who at the moment get away with very little by way of taxes. Those could help. But I think what's also important is to recognise that the Chancellor doesn't need to go as fast as he says he is going. This could be spread over a slightly longer time with less pain for individuals who are already suffering from a significant cost of living crisis. If the Chancellor doesn't show that he can balance the books today, markets won't have faith in the Government, will they? I think there's a lot to be repaired as the Chancellor is the Governor of the Bank of England said, yesterday, that reputation will take some time to repair. But I think it's desperately important that this isn't done by making things more difficult for the very poorest and society. For people, ordinary people who are just struggling with bills at the moment. But expanding the windfall tax share by-backs, closing tax leaps on non-doms, for example, that won't all pay for what we need to do in terms of energy support, pandemic spending. So whose taxes would rise if you were in charge? As I said, I think there are options that the Chancellor can look at in terms of those windfall taxes in terms of other options. There's other broader things that the Government could do in terms of economic crime, I'm on the Economic Craming Corporate Transparency Bill Committee at the moment. This Government loses an absolute fortune in economic crime in this country, in the tens of billions, at least they could tighten up on that to make sure that people aren't ripping off companies and tax payers as well. Yesterday, we learned that inflation hit 11.1 per cent in October. But the Office for National Statistics has said that it would have been 13.8 per cent had the Government not stepped in with support for energy. Now, that's expensive. Whoever's in charge is going to have to make support more targeted, aren't they? They are, but they have to make sure that people aren't left out as well. And organisations that National Energy Action have suggested an arrangement of people that the Chancellor must make sure that he doesn't leave out from these support packages. Because this really does make the difference. It's cold and wet and rainy here in Westminster, but there are people sitting in their houses under blankets with their coats on in their own homes. There are situations that people cannot put the lights on, putting heating on in their homes. And that's going to have a significant impact for many, many years to come on their health. And yesterday, at the Treasury Select Committee, you and your colleagues were grilling the Governor of the Bank of England Andrew Bailey. And it was put to him the comments that Michael Saunders, former Bank of England policymaker, made on Bloomberg TV, that we wouldn't be facing austerity if it weren't for Brexit. Is Brexit the elephant in the room at the Treasury? The elephant in many rooms, I would say, the Treasury aren't really acknowledging the pain that Brexit is causing, and the official opposition are also not acknowledging the pain that this hardest of Brexit, this choice that the Government has made is having on the economy. It's having significant impact as we heard in Everton's yesterday on imports, on exports, on the country's ability just to keep going in many cases.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,136,2022-11-17 07:40:00
17523," We would be happy if the speed could be named speed. China and the United States as two major countries both stand to gain from cooperation and lose from confrontation. We are at the beginning of a bridge building effort. As we look at supply chains around the world, they were fit for 20 to 30 years ago. The Sun for Banks misread the signs, they misread the risk of persistent and much higher ination. My team for choice, things 2023, we avoid a recession. I'm a little more skeptical. We're going to have new and improved data access protocols such that only an entity of US residents that in the US will have access to a certain set of US protected data. Crypto industry has been cut to ribbons this year. It's just too risky to sit out with a bunch of cowboys who have managed above themselves up. Global business finance and policy leaders discussing the risks currently at play as we head into day three of the Bloomberg New Economy Forum. You can watch the proceedings, live go, is the place to do that. And we'll have more from the Forum in Singapore coming up. We'll bring some of the highlights of course to Bloomberg TV, including the Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky. We'll be in conversation with Bloomberg's editor-in-chief John McEathweight. We'll be taking that live on Bloomberg TV at 8am London Times, just after the European market opened. Now let's get back to the markets and the Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said economic data over the past few weeks has made him quote, more comfortable with the idea of moderating the central bank's pace of interest rate hikes in December. Looking forward to the FOMC's December meeting, the data of the past few weeks has made me more comfortable considering stepping down to a 50 basis point hike. Talking about the stepping down there, then Patrick Armstrong is still with us from PlurimiWelf at CIO as he is there. Patrick, good to have you back on set with me. So let's focus in on the Fed. Do you expect to step down at the Fed? And what does the money supply data tell you about the amount of tightening we've already seen and what work still remains to be done? Yes, so I expect 50 basis points. I think listening to all the Fed speak over recent weeks starting with Powell's press conference after the last meeting, they are indicating that they're going to slow the pace of hikes. They've done a lot of work already. There's a lagged impact on the hikes as it flows through into the economy. The soft CPI print, especially the core number, came in at 0.3% month on month and showing there is slowing inflationary pressures. You mentioned M2. M2 was higher three months ago than it is today and you're on your M2 growth money supply growth in the United States. It's only 2.8% higher year on year. So that's a level that basically throughout COVID and the printing of money that was very inflationary. We've come to a level now where the monetary aggregates aren't going to be pushing inflation the way they have. So there's usually about an 18 month lag on money supply and inflation, usually about a year to a year and a half also on interest rate hikes to where they start to impact the economy and impact demand as well. And so we've seen hikes taking place what over the last seven, eight months. Yeah, definitely. So still some of it. Something of a lack to work three definitely and they're almost they're not flying blind, but they still haven't seen the numbers come through their data dependent, but the impact of the hikes that have happened all this year. I really going to start to impact demand next year. So I think a slowing hiking past makes a lot of sense. We're probably at the point where the US is going to be flirting with a recession next year as well too. So I think you can plausibly say that the hikes are going to be ending by the end of the first quarter next year if growth does slow because of the hikes that we've already. Where are you looking for those sort of high frequency signals about the way that growth is slowing in the United States? I mean, we were drawn to a conversation with mask recently that this is global, but he was talking about how quickly things were deteriorating towards the end of the year. We've seen FedEx putting some of their workers on furlough, you know, the logistics side of the economy as an area people often look to to get early clues, but then you get retail sales data out yesterday. They look pretty robust and gets us all worrying about tightening again. Yeah, retail sales were strong and again, that's a nominal number. So the same amount of goods that you're selling for 9% higher translates into strong retail sales number in nominal.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,138,2022-11-17 07:49:14

It's a significant impact, as we heard in Eveydon and Shester Day on imports, on exports, on the country's ability just to keep going in many cases. That impact is being felt by many businesses as well, they're not being able to make investments that they want to make, they're not able to hire the staff that they need to hire.

17525," about talking again. Yeah, retail sales were strong and again that's a nominal number. So the same amount of goods that you're selling for 9% higher translates into a strong retail sales number in nominal terms, even though real, it's not quite as strong. There's still 1.9 job openings for every unemployed person in the United States as well. So you've seen a lot of anecdotal evidence of companies will be laying off and big amounts of redundancies, but it's still people who want to work in the United States can still work in FIB surveys, 43% of companies saying the biggest issue they're facing right now are job openings are hard to fill as what they're saying. So unemployment will probably rise with the recession. It's not a leading indicator unemployment spikes during the recession. It doesn't tell you your recession's coming. It's when the recession's happening, it's when unemployment goes up and I think looking at jobs and inflation are the two metrics you really want to be focusing in to get a handle on where the Fed's going. Right, even if that's not going to be a leading indicator, still important obviously, and what the Fed watches. Let me pivot to a conversation around the ECB because yesterday we had a conversation with Luis de Wendos at the ECB and of course inflation is an issue in many places, but recession fears really dominate the European conversation increasingly. Let's have a listen to what he had to say. So with this inflation is the main contribution that we can make. In the sense that press stability is a precondition for financial stability. Now if you look at inflation, inflation is denting the real disposable income of households. Even is affecting corporate because of the increasing costs. Luis de Wendos, of course, from the ECB. Interesting there, putting the emphasis on inflation, that's what central banks have been doing recently. But then just after we did that interview, later on yesterday, our colleagues covering the ECB had a report out suggesting there's a possibility now and this was sourced to ECB officials of a step down from 75 to 50 basis points. As if they are maybe are they taking their lead from the Fed? Is there safety in doing that because the Fed might do it? What do you take that? I actually think they'll do 50. I think Bank of England will only be 50 as well because I don't think you want a relative tightening versus the Fed. The US economy is in a much stronger position than the European economy. Unfortunately for Europe and the UK, inflation is still much higher. And the weak currencies we had throughout this year from the Euro and GBP is importing inflation. But you have seen some strength in those currencies in recent weeks and that is a form of tightening as well. So I think my guess is for 50 basis points from all three of those banks in December. Okay, so they don't want relative tightening versus the Fed. You mentioned the UK in the context of that inflation conversation then Patrick and we had 11.1% inflation yesterday, 41 year high, of course, for the UK. Do you think some people say it's still to peak in the spring of next year? It's going to be close. I don't think we're going to see another leg up in inflation. I think we're at the plateauing part for the United Kingdom and Europe where it's still very high. It's not really showing signs that it's coming down, but I expect that to happen over the coming months. So I'm not sure that it's necessarily peaked, but I don't think it's going to be moving much higher on your own. Patrick, thanks very much. Thanks for spending time with us today here on Blumberg TV.

Welcome back to Bloomberg market, Europe. Eight or so minutes ago, let's call it seven. Shall we until the start of cash equity trading in Europe? The Future's look a little stagnant elsewhere, expecting a little bit of upside. In London, of course, we're waiting for the autumn statement, plenty of coverage as we run up to that and will bring you full coverage of the event itself later on this morning. Let's focus in on the start of trading, though, as it is just minutes away, Danny Berkert joins us with a breakdown of the stocks in focus. Let's start with the Zeeman's, then, numbers out from the German giants. Yeah, and really optimistic figures when it comes to their outlook. The fourth quarter earnings themselves basically just being in line if not slightly stronger. But again, it's all about this outlook. Zeeman's talking about the fact that they have just this massive order book that's going to carry them through, so upgrading their earnings per share guidance. And alongside that, they've also proposed increasing their dividend. Of course, dividend news always gets this market excited. They did say, look, our best estimate for next year, it does depend on no disruptions on the supply chain with COVID. They do say they see that easing no geopolitical risk coming into the fore. Should everything go to plan a sunny outlook for Zeeman's? Okay, well, we'll see how that one trades. Talking of dividends, Tis and Cripp, also in focus, the stalemaker. Yeah, exactly. So they are proposing a dividend. It will be their first one should have get approved since 2018. I mean, it's a story of two sides because that dividend, they're able to do so because of the cash flow. They see themselves breaking even in 2022 and 2023. That is a huge positive because Tis and Cripp hasn't been able to do that in six years. So this is a big change. But the fly and the ointment here is they are still operating in a very tough environment. They did say they expect their earnings to drop over the next year. It's because of the thing everyone's dealing with inflation, supply chain issues. So yes, they are seeing their earnings weak, but cash flow does seem to be improving. Okay. Now, on to Burberry. And I was focused earlier on what they were saying about China, which is interesting. And maybe you can take us through some of what they've said around the earnings. But I'm also taken by a headline to one story, Danny, that says, Burberry's new chief plans a return to British, Britishness as sales rise. I don't really know what that means, but we'll wait and see, I suppose. I don't think I know what that means either. Also can I say these earnings, I mean, they weren't very British in that they were helped by my people, Anna. They were helped by the Americans because sales did grow. They saw their sales come in 11% the analysis or analyst estimate was for 8.3%. And really what folks are attributing to this too is the fact that Americans with a strong dollar with a weak euro went overseas and bought Burberry clothes and North America's sales for their own part dropped. So it does imply people were going overseas to buy it. Well, we thank your people very much, Danny. There's nothing like the special relationship to help out. Sometimes it's neat. Danny Berger with the latest on the markets and stocks in focus. Now, we have special coverage coming of course, all morning, the UK's autumn statement, very much in focus for us. Lizzie Burton is on the green 9.30 London time. We have a special program focused exclusively on that. And don't miss coming up shortly.

17527," with our editor-in-chief John Mickles Wake that's coming up right here on Bloomberg TV. This is is Blaine goes back Why is everybody want to be a consultant and what are all these consultants doing? Well David, I think that we actually defy the label consultant because sometimes consultant seems to imply that we only give advice and when you look at what Accenture does, we're really different than the traditional version of a consultant. We're really about relevance and results and that's what is driving our business. What about a consulting project? In my example on the CEO, I have a problem, I call you up, I say, solve my problem or give me a solution. I don't operate as big companies permanently in crisis mode and so when you think about like how long does it solve things, a lot of it starts with, you know, the company being willing to set aggressive goals and so what we are trying to do now is work with our clients to work differently and to work faster.

Welcome to the European market, open a minute to go until the start of cash equity trading. I'm Tom McKenzie in London and here are your top stories. Face into the storm UK Chancellor Jeremy Hunt delivers his highly anticipated budget statement today seeking to stabilize the public finances amid economic headwinds. Let down by tech Asia stocks follow Wall Street into the red as a sell off in Chinese technology shares intensifies the dollar snaps a two day decline and the Ukrainian president for the new economy forum in Singapore will bring you this hour. Let's take a look at these markets. A couple of hits from the China session, yes, the technology session and 10 cents selling off or release releasing about $20 billion worth of its holdings and shares in May-twine and investors concern they will be further divestments from tenement. So warning from the people's bank of China that inflation could pause and pose something they've challenged with an economy making maybe the policy response a little bit more muted in the months and quarters ahead from Chinese officials. The Spanish Ibex currently at two tenths of a percent here in the U.S.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,141,2022-11-17 08:01:39
17528," was and posed something that were challenged with an economy making maybe the policy response a little bit more muted in the months and quarters ahead from Chinese officials. The Spanish Ibex currently up to 10th of a percent here in the UK the FTSE 100 is flat ahead of that all important autumn statement and the analysis as well for the OBR as to the trajectory of this beleaguered UK economy. Let's switch it over and see how things are playing out cross asset then. We mentioned the US dollar the losses across US equities yesterday, but future suggesting that you are back to a point where you could see some gains. Futures pointing up by 4.10 of a percent interesting to hear pushback again from Fed officials. Mary Daley of the San Francisco Fed saying a pause is not on the table. Goldman Sachs raising their rate in terms of the terminal rate for the Fed to 5.25 percent from 5 percent. The pound currently at 119. Watch of course that asset on the back of the autumn statement. The US dollar is 19. That is gained of just 2.10 of a percent. The 10th of a benchmark 368 over in the US and Brent. 92 dollars a barrel. That's down 2.10 of a percent as the focus switches back from geopolitics back to the demand question. We have the China boards that we want to bring to your attention as well given that sell off in technology. Again, linked to what we saw from 10 cent and its holdings in Maytwin. The key concern again is that investments across the tech space, particularly in Asia, is going to further divest. They are under pressure from regulators in China to do just that. The HSI currently trading at 18,000. That's a drop of 1 percent. The HSI tech index home again to the biggest tech names in China. 3,729. That is a drop of 2 percent. Of course this has been a very volatile index on the back of some of the changes, regulatory changes we've seen in China. The UN 712, that is down by 4.10 of a percent for the Chinese currency. A couple of individual corporates to bring to your attention. We've had more earnings coming through. Of course the big conglomerate, the industrial giant of Siemens. Yet to face or show a price, but it was a top line. It was a beat for this company. The order back lock. Very strong indeed. I spoke to this year, not overly concerned about recession risks. They're doing well in terms of selling software and they are comfortable with margins as they see them. Burberry. That was also a beat on the top line. The price though, or the stock is currently down 7.10 of a percent. Luxury has held up during this cost of living crisis broadly. And Volkswagen up 1 percent. We did have auto sales finally coming back in Europe. An increase of 14 percent in the most recent month. Whether or not that's going to propel these auto stocks higher. Volkswagen up just 1 percent in the session. Let's bring in Danny Berger now. Danny, you've been looking at the yield inversion stateside. And of course, all the debate that is continuing around the pace and rate of these exchanges or at least these interest rate increases stateside, Danny. Yeah, Tom, you know, I'm never too far from the yield curve and the debate around it. Yeah, yesterday we saw the yield curve reach its most inverted level since the 1980s going sub negative 60. It kind of is almost this reversal of the reversal. We got really excited about that CPI report that saw yields come down stocks rally dollar move lower. But look, you laid it out. We've had hawkish fed official from hawkish fed official because obviously they don't want that rally. They don't want financial conditions to loosen. So Mary daily talking about a peak that could be 5 and a quarter percent. Esther George talking to the Wall Street Journal saying that the most important question for them is not to stop too soon. Yes, Waller yesterday saying, okay, 50 basis points from now on, but still have a ways to go. You add to that the retail sales that comfortably beat in the US yesterday, the picture you get is perhaps it is just too soon, Tom, to be betting that the peak inflation narrative is over. Yeah, is that question about whether or not the markets are over exuberant when they see a softer than expected CPI print and then that pushback, as you say, from the Fed, we know how concerned they are about the loosening of financial conditions. On that retail sales, Brent Danny, it suggests that the consumer remains in pretty rude health state side. Yeah, it certainly does. And again, that potentially is why the curve inverted further that the Fed does need to be more forceful. They have more room to hike interest rates. But Tom, it is interesting to start to see some of the pressure, some of the cracks we had target earnings yesterday and they lowered their outlook because they are seeing their consumers pulling back not to mention that we're looking at mortgage.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,142,2022-11-17 08:06:03
17529," the cracks. We had target earnings yesterday and they lowered their outlook because they are seeing their consumers pulling back, not to mention that we're looking at mortgage rates at a 20-year high that really eats into affordability and the ability of the consumer to spend. You also have credit tightening as rates rise and of course the consumer at this moment is heavily reliant on credit. Credit debt is the highest. It's all time highs in the U.S. So should that pain continue? You could start to see it seep into data and it just is a reminder that the Fed is data dependent and this market can turn on a dime depending on what this data shows. Yeah and we heard from the Fed's wallet. Well we don't have that time to follow up question because we now are going to cross over to Singapore and Bloomberg to Edward Zunchief, John McElthweight in conversation with the Ukrainian President of Lodemir Zelensky at the new economy forum in Singapore. Let's listen in. This forum briefly, so we'll hand over to him as I think most of you know you do have headsets underneath your seats. Channel 2 is Mandarin, Channel 3 is Ukrainian and Channel 4 is English. Thank you very much. President Zelensky, welcome to the new economic forum. You are here. Please take it away. Thank you very much, John. The LAGES and Jashimon, thank you for your attention to Ukraine. Our today's conversation finalizes practically the work of your forum and this is very symbolic because the global situation will directly depend on when and how the Russian – the aggression will finish. You can see how many threats have been provoked by this aggression to the world. I'll give you just three examples but there are more of them, much more than three. Just now there was yet another terrorist attack in the morning dozens of missiles hitting civil targets predominantly. Russia is hitting the electricity and heat for people, heating power stations and other energy infrastructure. This is the daily reality in Ukraine, the Russian terror. This is why we're contributing so much effort to get the modern air defense and anti-missile defense from the partners. Plus we have more than a thousand kilometres of front warfare. What does mean from the global point of view? Instead of investing trillions of dollars in the development of the human capital, the world is going to spend huge amount of money to re-equip their weaponry. Now everyone is watching very carefully how we are defending ourselves in Ukraine, looking at the performance of the weapons, which tactics would work better, which defense systems perform the best. To be honest, just a several countries could have been doing the same in terms of protecting themselves from aggression with the same intensity as we are doing this. It's just they don't have so many shells and weapons to do this. But potential aggressors and potential frozen conflicts that can spark up again are more than such countries that can defend themselves. So that we have a huge deficit of security because the more forms of terror Russia is using in this war, the more money ultimately will be used in the world for new weapons and protecting themselves, preventing these such strikes that we are going through. Another example, instead of focusing most of our attention to green transformation, different governments are looking for cheaper oil supply, gas supply or coal supply to reduce energy prices. The price of energy and not the purity of energy becomes number one for many countries. And this wouldn't have been the case, had it not been for Russian aggression and the use of energy resources by Russia as a weapon. The third example, just in a couple of weeks, officially we have.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,143,2022-11-17 08:10:16
17530," energy resources by Russia as a weapon. The third example, just in a couple of weeks, artificially, we have the threat of famine for dozens of millions of people, not because of the drought or crisis, but because of the blockade of our ports. We are the exporting country of food products. For dozens of years, the world hasn't seen anything similar to any new catastrophe because of the high prices for on-food or famine means subtracting more years from global development. You have been discussing many topics during your forum, but how many of them do not depend or what Russia has done or will do with its aggression. When Ukraine is proposing the peace formula, this is truly a peace formula, not just for us but for the whole world. The comprehensive threat requires comprehensive response. Just a simple cease-fire will not do the trick. This is our formula, it has to be sustainable and long-term peace, just by simply simpil mitigating the crisis caused by Russia will not bring back the stability. We have to dismantle each and every threat. During the Indonesia Summit, I presented our proposal of the reliable peace and dismantling of Russia and Fred, and I am grateful to all the countries who are supporting the Ukrainian peace formula, and now I would like to give one more argument. What does peace mean? This is very practical. It means saving lives, stabilisation and development in the first place. Joining the building of Ukraine, many companies and countries are getting additional growth incentives. When we restore our territorial integrity and will have reliable peace, Ukraine will become the reliable source of new global development. This is not just about economy, this is about modern economy. Just to give you three more examples, Ukraine is prepared to replace the dirty fossil fuels from Russia with the green energy of ours. We have huge potential in the low carbon energy sector. Ukraine is capable of becoming a key partner to European Union for the purposes of de-carbonisation. We can become the suppliers of green hydrogen and green power to Ukraine. Climate conditions, green fields, energy resources, resources of wind and solar will allow us to produce energy at a low cost. In the last three years, before our aggression, we have created seven gigs of reliable sources, and we have much more capability. We can produce dozens of millions of tons of cheap money plus nuclear energy and power infrastructure, which is connected to the energy creator of the European Union. Now, Russian missile terror is aiming our energy and energy capabilities. Russia just in one day, day before yesterday, launched almost 100 missiles against our power infrastructure, yet today again. So the losses are colossal, but it means that rebuilding will have to be a large-scale project, and I'm inviting your countries and your companies to start joining this rebuilding initiative. We have the decision of one of the biggest Australian investment groups who committed first $500 million into the green growth of Ukraine under 25 billion rebuilding facility of Ukraine, and I'm grateful to Mr. Andrew Forrest for his decision to be the first and lorry thing from BlackRock in helping to structure this fund. Another example is resources. The modern economy needs lithium, craft fire and other rare metals.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,144,2022-11-17 08:14:38
17531," Another example is resources. The modern economy needs lithium, craft art, and other rare metals. In some of these resources we have the biggest deposits in Europe, and this is in itself a colossal opportunity plus transport capability, machine building capacity, our culture of labour, and access to the lead markets of the world. So this is the basis of the growth that everyone needs. The third is the agricultural sector, the world knows that without Ukrainian agricultural export, the challenge of food supplies cannot be resolved. And we've just made the decision of extending our grain supply 120 days. But we want to have unlimited duration of this initiative. Plus we have initiated the grain from Ukraine program. So that together with partners we could produce and give as much food support to the poorest countries as we can. But bringing back peace to Ukraine means that we will not just be able to stabilize the market and respond to the crisis, but to safeguard the food stability and prevention of any further crisis. And I just give them three examples. There are much more of them. To need the peace in Ukraine is a global need, not just the peaceful, similar kind of ceasefire which Russia would use, abuse to prepare for the new world, but the real peace. And I know we can achieve this, but for this we have to safeguard the global unity. We have to be protecting the global honesty and pose more pressure on Russia for the terror and cooperate together with us for the future development. Thank you very much again for your attention. Let us reach a liable peace, slow-mo cleaning. Thank you very much. You have given a very eloquent defense of Ukraine's position and of your future possibilities. Can we just clear one thing up at the beginning, the rocket that landed in Poland? You know that Poland, the United States and others are saying that it appears to be one of your defensive rockets. I think it's clear no one blames you for this. You were trying to shoot down Russian missiles as they came in, but you have as far as I can see insisted that the rocket that hit Poland was fired by Russia. I wonder if you still stand by that. Thank you for this question. First of all everyone has to understand that there were about hundred missiles that were launched on that day. And I'm grateful for the well-to for the support of Ukraine with air defense and anti-missile defense. But nevertheless you can see what are the consequences and aftermath of the Russian war. This is not the first time that the whole missile, a piece of missile of Russia, falls down on the territory of another country. Some time ago the same thing happened, the pieces of the Russian missiles fell on the territory of Moldova and it was aiming into Ukrainian territory. I don't know what happened this time, we don't know 100%. I think the world also does know what happened, 100% in their situation. But I'm sure that this is a Russian missile and I'm sure that we were launching the air defense missiles. But we can't say specifically that this was the air defense of Ukraine, although we are grateful for not being blamed because we are fighting against the Russian missiles in our territory, but nevertheless we have to be fair and honest until the investigation is over.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,145,2022-11-17 08:18:54
17532," Russian missiles on our territory, but nevertheless, we have to be fair and honest. Until the investigation is over, we can't say what kind of missile or what pieces of which a missile fell on the Polish territory. What we have seen, the pictures, their diameter of the whole, shows that it couldn't have been just the remnants of their air defense. That's what the military told me. But again, I would like to emphasize that the most important is for the investigation to take place. Yesterday we insisted for us to be part of joined international investigative group and late at night we got the confirmation and early in the morning our professionals will go to the scientific will be part of this professional investigation. Thank you for clearing that up. Since the summer your military has made enormous progress in regaining your territory, most obviously, Kesson. I suppose the question I have for you is what about Crimea, which Vladimir Putin, annexed in 2014, is your war aim now to retake Crimea or would merely taking back the Donbas be enough? Thank you for this question. Our war is the war for our lives. You do remember the scale of occupation by Russia, of our territory and what happened in China's 24th of February. Our objective was to stay strong and bring back the life and peace on our land. Unless we de-occupy our whole territory, this will not bring peace to us. Unfortunately, this is the leader of Russian Federation. This is his decision. You see this. They don't want Ukraine to develop. Ukraine has chosen its way forward and it will develop. And it is developing. In some areas we're developing master, even during the war, then Russia Federation, which doesn't have war on its soil. So for the stability of the situation for our country, we have to take certain steps. And I think that restoration of territorial integrity of our country is one of those important steps to be made. And also the support of international community investments and etc. It is to be absolutely clear about it de-occupying as you put it, includes Crimea. It is an important difference because it will be taking the border back to where it was. The effective border where it was in 2014. Is that your starting point before peace can happen? Crimea is part of Ukraine. This is not just a state within a state. It's part of our country and part of our sovereignty. Therefore, indeed, the occupation of Crimea and Donbass will bring the end to the war. What is your estimate now for when the fighting might end? You just talked about a long-term peace. When might the fighting end? As of now, we've de-occupied one big regional capital that Russia managed to occupy this since the 24th of February, the only one that they occupied. That's for Sond. It's a big town for you. Sond, region, in terms of area.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,146,2022-11-17 08:23:16
17533," the only one that they occupy. And that's her son, her big territory, her son, rich in terms of area, you can see in these two, you can see several countries of the world and that's a big and important territory to Ukraine. So the next steps are difficult because there's Don Baster's, Harkiv, Oblast, we almost deoccupied the whole Harkiv, Oblast, so the Donbass and the Crimea and also the left bank of the Nipariv, the so-perjured nuclear power plant is being occupied, the Parisier Oblast, so no one can tell that this can will happen tomorrow. But I would ask the question, who does this depend on right now? I heard the minister for an affairs of Egypt and I took note. He said the resolution of war depends on the political will of those who are involved in the conflict. He said it very carefully, as an political figure, we are not involved in the conflict. And I would like just to respond to that, we were involved by Russian Federation. They came into our territory, our political will since the very beginning was to deal with this in a diplomatic manner. So our political will doesn't determine the end of the war, we didn't start anything to want to end it. Of course we want to end the war, we want the Russia to go away, it depends on the political will of the Russian Federation. To be honest, I want even the Russian Federation. We are about a group of people who are managed in the lead Russian Federation. So the time of putting the end to the war depends on them. On our side, if there is that political will on the other side, we will, if there is no political, we will go forward and continue to occupying our territory. That's one, two, it also depends on what, it depends on what Egypt has demonstrated. This is not just resolving an issue or a challenge. This is the war with its own crisis, crisis that spread to the whole world. It was done not only to Ukraine and the countries should acknowledge this, not to be afraid and not just to say conflict instead of war. And then this war with the joint support of international community will be resolved in a very swift manner. You are potentially open to talks with Russia, but not while Vladimir Putin is president. Does that really make sense? Putin is the president, short of the Russians removing him. That removes, that means there is no chance of peace talks whilst he is still president. Is Russia still stick by that? Yes, because of the surest of the problem. As I said, if Russia does another referendum, pseudo-referendum, that is not acknowledged by anyone in the world, if they acknowledge our territories, the leader with such position will not be acknowledged by us. Me as a president cannot have any negotiations with him. That's what I said. And they conducted the referendum, and I said there is no point of talking to this person. There is no point. He will not change his policy. This is the occupying policy. He is talking about peace. Just like he said, he was just during the 220, and on that same day, just with this audacity, he launches hundreds strikes against Ukraine. What can we talk about? The decision is not one person.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,147,2022-11-17 08:27:44
17534," But this audacity, he launches hundreds strikes against Ukraine. What can we talk about? Putin is not one person. There's a several people and there's nothing to talk about with these several people today. If tomorrow they are prepared to take the peace formula, if they are ready to withdraw from our territory, de-occupy Ukraine and acknowledge that this is a tragedy, and not just a mistake, that this is a tragedy of them being aggressors. If they are ready to compensate, or as it is prescribed in the peace formula, if they are ready to accept it, only then we can start thinking about talking to this group of people. And if in Russia there will be other people who will be prepared on the diplomatic level to acknowledge the peace formula in any format. But first of all, acknowledge our territorial integrity that we are a subject, that we are same people as they are, that they will have to acknowledge that you can't destroy Ukrainians. You can't rape people, you can't kill children. If such people will appear in Russia, we are ready to talk to them, of course. You've described very accurately the way that the Ukrainian economy has got hit, you know, contracted by, I think, 30 percent of the past year. You have inflation at 26 percent. You've got around 40 percent of your power facilities out in the attacks. The question of how you get the economy going together, going again, what are the industries you want to focus on, and you have an audience of investors, where is the place that you most want investment from abroad, and help from abroad? Thank you for this question. First of all, I think that we're doing all we can, and the world is helping us in protecting the sky, and 40 percent of our energy infrastructure was hit, so energy is very relevant. Also gas production is another priority sector. We have not shrank our IT sector. It's growing to the country. So some of the technologies that we have developed before the full-clatched aggression, some of the technologies really triggered. We have this stability in the IT sector. We were protected from cyber attacks. There was a huge number of cyber attacks, and they continued. We're still standing strong, so all services are still operating in Ukraine, the banking system, et cetera. So IT sector is developing very strongly. Also, because of the war, we have a very strong development of the technologies. We said that we're going to build the fleet of seed drones, and many of such things are being developed. And here we see a huge potential, and agriculture as one of the key and areas, of course. So we are very open. We invite everyone to come. All the areas starting from extraction to technologies. I think your investments will be strengthened, not only by your will, but also by our protection. We have started discussion with the World Bank yesterday. We had a meeting with a vice president of the World Bank, and we are saying that the World Bank, and we will start the pilot with them to ensure investments in Ukraine, I think. But that will contribute as well, and that will give us, sure, and as to the business to invest in Ukraine. You mentioned the Green Deal and the exports of Ukraine.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,148,2022-11-17 08:31:54
17535," I think that will contribute as well and that would give assurances to the business to invest in Ukraine. You mentioned the grain deal and the exports of grain and that looks as if it's sort of going to roll over. The other big issue is fertilizer. You produce a lot of the world's fertilizer and everyone is worried about the fact it's stuck, including Russian fertilizer. Do you think there is room for a deal on that as well? Thank you for this question. The grain deal is already extended. This is not negotiated. This is already a fact. Four months more. As I said in my statement, but one of the items of the piece formula is that it has to be unrestricted. Apart from the grain deal, we have to understand that we have grown strongly in logistics. We have built different pathways during this war in the several months. That's another area where the investments could come and we invite them. And also the processing industry. You're talking, I think you mentioned the ammonia transit. I said that we can agree to this only if the humanitarian aspects of exchange of all the soldiers to all their soldiers. We don't want to trade with Russia and help them because this is our enemy and unless they change the tactics, this is not possible. The only way we can talk about the chemicals, about the fertilizers. I explained this to the General Secretary and all the partners know this. Only if we will exchange all the captives, our captives for their captives. Ukraine is dependent on foreign financial aid. The European Union has roughly $3 billion a month. And yet some people think the European Union has been quite slow to deliver the money it's promised. Why won't Brussels move faster to help you? First of all, we're grateful to all the partners for their financial assistance. They provide. We do have a deficit in the budget and of course the economy during the war is not working as it used to work before. And how it will work after the war. So the 3 billion per month from the European Union is what we're getting. We're not getting. We would be grateful if we could have received them. But we're grateful for what we already have. We're getting from EU partners from Great Britain, from Canada, a big assistance from the United States and several other governments, bilaterally from the European Union ad hoc assistance. It goes slowly because there is this institutional aspect and bureaucracy of course. Of course we would want to do it faster. We're now discussing with the EU to close the deficit gap for 2023 and the support for the Ukrainian budget in the amount of 18 billion next year or a soul of underline confirmed this capability and the political world to do so and that will be able to get that. But we are touring the war. This is why as the president of the country.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,149,2022-11-17 08:36:16
17536," political to do so and that will be able to get that. But we are during the war. This is why as the president of the country of war, I'd like to say that we are all grateful, but I have to be more pragmatic until we get it. I can't say that we got it, so, but we believe in this. Can I ask you to move from the pragmatism of your current situation, which everyone understands? You're at war, you're under attack. But if you look forward to Ukraine after the war, how will Ukraine be different after the war than it was before? To give you one example, many of us when we came to Ukraine, one persistent worry was corruption. Will the new Ukraine, that everyone admires so much at the moment, with the Ukraine that emerges from the war? Will it be different like that? You famously ran for president not to fight a war, but to get rid of corruption. How will Ukraine be different in four or five years? First of all, there will not be political influence of Russia on Ukraine, and secondly, there will not be influence of Russian capital. They withdrawn from our companies, we've pushed them out. The political parties that they were influencing are banned and they will not dissipate the next election. So the information or influence on our development and geopolitical direction will not be there as well. And this is very important because that shapes the independence of our country and also investments and the condition with corruption. There will be no corruption. We don't have it now, of course, because we're all united around our country. Many people corrupt, people have left the country with their money, and we will do our best for them to stay where they now are. The most important things that we have to focus on, we are united only those who want to protect their country. No one will be able to forgive corruption in future after the war, because we've lived through very difficult challenges in the war. Technologically, there will be no corruption because during this time we will have done everything to make sure that it works online. We already have cuts in the management of our government agencies. There should be less government in the business. So this is why we're doing all services digitally. So we started this with COVID, because of the pandemics. But during the war, we have boosted this with new dynamic. So all the services are going to be electronic. So there will not be contact with the civil servants, and there will not be pressure on business. And this talks about the independence of economy and transparency of investment. And these are the most important things. I think that many people who have left Ukraine, many families, with children and students who want to come back and build their country based on different values. And I think this will be a completely different country where I would like to welcome you to come. I think if you are fighting a war, it is always good to have a dream. And I hope that you realize yours. President Zelensky, thank you very much for talking to the new economy forum. Thank you very much for talking to Bloomberg. And I'm sure the audience is like you. We have just been hearing then from the Ukrainian President of the Vladimir Zelensky speaking to John McElthwaite Bloomberg's editor in chief at the new economy forum in Singapore. Do you want us to recap that conversation then, is Bruce Einhorn in Hong Kong? A range of topics there being addressed and put to the Ukrainian President by John McElthwaite Bruce. What really stood out for you?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,150,2022-11-17 08:40:37
17537," in Hong Kong. A range of topics there being addressed and put to the Ukrainian President by John McElthweight, Bruce. What really stood out for you? Quite a lot of news that the President of Ukraine made in response to questions from John McElthweight. First about the explosion in Poland, very close to the border with Ukraine, while President Biden and Secretary General NATO and others have said that most likely this was a Ukrainian missile that was fired in defense. President Zelensky said, well, we're waiting to see the results of the investigation. He said it couldn't have been just the remnant of our air defense. So he's still holding out, holding out the possibility that this could have been something from Russia. In response to a question about what would it take to end the war? Is Ukraine looking for a liberation of Crimea, something that Putin annexed in 2014? Or would liberation of the Donbass, the eastern part of Ukraine that's occupied by Russia? Would that be sufficient? President Zelensky said a Crimea is part of Ukraine. It's part of our country and part of our sovereignty, deoccupation of Crimea and Donbass will bring an end to the war. In response to a question about earlier statement by President Zelensky that there's no point in speaking to President Putin, President Zelensky said, well, if they're ready to deoccupy, if they're ready to compensate Ukraine, if they're ready to accept the peace formula, then there's room to talk. In addition, he talked about, most notably, the final question that John Mikhailovich asked him about corruption in Ukraine. Ukraine notorious for corruption before President Zelensky took over President Zelensky, ran on the campaign of stamping out corruption. He was quite emphatic in his answer, saying there will be no more corruption in Ukraine after the war. Ukrainians are united having gone through this ordeal that they're going through now. There will be no tolerance for corruption going forward. Quite a lot of things that President addressed in this interview. Very interesting. Yeah. And Bruce, there was real outreach from the President as well when it comes to the economy, to those investors in the room in Singapore to look to Ukraine. If not now, then in the future, as a place to invest their money, whether in infrastructure energy or agricultural and deep technology and IT, there was also the question about the support that Brussels is sending to Ukraine, whether that is indeed sufficient. When it comes to the economy, he outlined a pretty tough picture for Ukraine, of course, within this fight, but investors may be starting to look now what could be the opportunities in two, three, four years' time. Yes, you're right. And he did highlight certain sectors. He mentioned the energy sector, the gas sector, IT, because he said that that's an area where Ukraine has really been developing in large heart because of the need to do this during the war. He mentioned drones as another area of potential for Ukraine logistics. These are all sectors that President Zelensky said would be of interest for foreign investors going forward. Okay, Bruce Einhorn with the analysis and takeaways from that important interview, of course, with the Russian or Ukrainian President, I should say, Devalademy, I should say, Zelensky, of course, with our Michaelthwaite, John Michaelthwaite, our chief editor. Coming up, UK Chancellor Jeremy Hunt delivers his highly anticipated budget statement that is later today.

One of the most important things is looking around the corner. We have to let go of the traditional legacy department store. Their impact goes far beyond the balance sheet. And on Chief Future Officer, they focus on much more than just revenues and margins. The odds have to be credible business leaders in order to really impact the business and steal the direction. We are like biologists. We need to deeply understand the financial DNA of a company. People just come with a playbook and say, OK, we're going to roll that. Don't do that. Pink longer term. I think to be successful in a role like these, it is not only technical knowledge. It is about passion. They have to love worry of us, right? They do. Get passion, perspective, and more from the Chief Future Officers of some of the world's most influential companies. A new episode every month, only on Bloomberg.

We are in position by 2030 to 80% of all electricity generated by wind. The renewables are the safest, the cleanest and the cheapest form of energy. Today especially for countries such as Greece. Nobody covers climate change like Bloomberg, your global business authority. Welcome back. Here in the UK, Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt is set to deliver his highly anticipated budget statement today. Let's get to Bloomberg's UK correspondent, then Lizzie burden, who is at Westminster, with a really important guest on the context of this autumn statement. Lizzie. Thank you, Tom. I'm joined by Conservative MP and new chairwoman of the Treasury Select Committee, Harriet Baldwin. Thanks very much for joining me on this busy morning. We now seem to have a market friendly Chancellor. He's working with the Office for Budget Responsibility, with the Bank of England and with the Treasury Machine. But the markets ended up being the real check and balance on the mini budget, not the economic institutions. What are the guardrails for government? I think you summed up the situation really well there, and we are in a different situation than we were back in September. As the committee, we've been calling for that Office for Budget Responsibility Report. We very much welcome the fact that that's going to be one of the things that we see today. We've got the Office for Budget Responsibility in front of the committee next Tuesday, and one of the things we'll want to be probing there is about their forecasts and what sort of assumptions they're making in those forecasts. I think it's really important that the UK demonstrate today that we can pay our way and after the guardrails, as you put them slightly fell away during September and October, that we are back on track and well-guarded on all sides by the institutional strength of the United Kingdom. So do we need a rule change? So that any type of fiscal statement, quote-unquote, budget or not, is costed by the OBR? Well, I can't speak for the committee, but I do think that that is an important aspect of what needs to happen, but bear in mind that we just went through a massive pandemic that at the time the Prime Minister, Richard Sunak, is Prime Minister now, he was Chancellor then, he announced such a sort of world-beating amount of support in record time.

17540," When you think space you probably think one space agency that travels under the radar is ESSA, which is surprising considering what the European Space Agency has achieved and how vital it is to the global space industry. We've collaborated with pretty much everybody who is involved in space exploration. The ESSA wants to be a leading force in furthering humanity's mission into space. Command the ground for your copy. If we want to have a successful human missions to Mars, we are going to have to learn to live and work off-world in a different way. The place where we are going to learn to do that is on the move. Can ESSA help humanity take its next giant leap? A multi-trillion dollar industry. There's a lot of ground to cover. Commanding is absolutely crushed. We'll show you what's happening in ETFs like no one else. Bloomberg ETF IQ Monday on Bloomberg. This is a market that over the past few weeks has made it clear it wants to go higher. It got a little spooked by the idea that geocolatal potential rises. Looking forward to the FOMC's December meeting, the data of the past few weeks have made me more comfortable considering stepping down to a 50 basis point hike. The Fed's Christopher Waller there, signaling he may be leaning towards a softer hike of 50 basis points in December. With the caveat that he needs to see the data that comes through before that decision. Besides from US data and Fed Davishness, let's focus into the themes driving markets today. Joining us now is our equity reporter, Jan Patrick Barnett. The markets appear to be consolidating. We're looking at futures up about 2.5 percent. We are still weighing up the commentary from these Fed officials. We had a San Francisco Fed president saying a pause is not in the cards. It's not on the table. There seems to be this push and pull between market exuberance and Fed officials who come and try and poor cold water because they're worried about the loosening and the easing of financial conditions. That is absolutely understandable. They want to see the pause, the rates coming down preferably. The central banks are still seeing the inflation problem and they want to keep on fighting that. The thing is the market is battling with this direction right now. We're seeing a bit of a consolidation today and probably for the next couple of days. Indicators have run a little bit hard after that massive rally. We have seen over the past months. That's pretty normal. Let's not forget. We've only got more visibility about the inflation probably having peaked but we have no visibility yet how low it can go and where it will end up. A bit of lack of direction it seems for these markets. What is the next signpost that you and the team are looking for? We are definitely looking for CPI numbers. We got the confirmation numbers today for Europe not expecting much of a surprise there. Then we have the next reading for Europe at the end of the month and then again at mid-December for the US that is something we are watching. We are also watching the options market again yesterday. Some people said it's looking pretty cheap to hatch the downside. So maybe it's not a bad idea to lock in the year end in case there is any more macro accident. We got a bad reminder the other day with the rockets into Poland and it showed like how fragile the market still is. Again, this is a rally that is driven more by technicals rather than fundamentals. We still want to see if fundamentals going to improve to have more legs for that. And tech taking a bit of a beating yesterday. Any cause for optimism within that sector? Well a little bit. The NVIDIA numbers today don't look too bad. Given that what we have seen over the last couple of weeks from tech in general. But one thing that struck out to me is that they had a minus 50% decline in their gaming business and that's the consumer. We are always hearing that the consumer is pretty healthy but I wonder if revenue is dropping so much if the appetite for the new gaming PC for Christmas is not too bad.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,154,2022-11-17 08:58:05
17541," It's a consumer. We're always hearing that the consumer is pretty healthy, but I wonder like revenue is dropping so much if the appetite for the new gain you can see for Christmas is not too great right now. Equities to report to young Patrick Barnett, always excellent. Thank you. Currently you're seeing the benchmark here in Europe range bound futures US, putting up by two tenths percent. That is it for the European market open surveillance early edition. Is up next? Is Blue Bubouve is blue Bubb. Why is everybody want to be a consultant? And what are all these consultants doing? Well, David, I think that we actually defy the label consultant because sometimes consultant seems to imply that we only give advice. And when you look at what Accenture does, we're really different than the traditional version of a consultant. We're really about relevance and results. And that's what is driving our business. What about a consulting project? In my example, on the CEO, I have a problem. I call you up. I say, solve my problem or give me a solution. We don't operate as big companies permanently in crisis mode. And so when you think about how long does it solve things, a lot of it starts with the company being willing to set aggressive goals. And so what we are trying to do now is work with our clients to work differently and to work faster. Bloomberg is live at COP27 in Charm Elshake, Egypt.

Good morning and welcome to Bloomberg's Venezuelan edition. I'm Tom McKenzie in London. Here's what's coming up on today's program. Let down by tech, Asia stocks follow Wall Street into the red as a sell-off in Chinese technology shares and intensifies the dollar snaps a two-day decline. Face into the storm, UK Chancellor Jeremy Hunt delivers his highly anticipated budget statement today seeking to stabilize the public finances amid economic headwinds. And the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, speaks to Bloomberg on the final day of the new economy forum in Singapore.

17542," and two Ukraine. So that's the geopolitics. Let's check in on these markets. Then very modest gains across the benchmark here in Europe of two tenths of a percent. We're looking, of course, at what's happening in the UK, the FTSE 100 currently down by four tenths of a percent, as we lead up to that important autumn statement around 1130 AM UK time from the UK Chancellor and how it sets out the spending cuts and tax plans for this government to address a 55 billion pound fiscal whole. The futures in the US are putting up by two tenths of a percent on an ASDAQ S&P's on the S&P even is the Nasdaq futures are putting up by three tenths of a percent. The Bloomberg dollar index, you can see there again, of about a tenth of a percent. And of course, we keep an eye on the pound and guilt as well. Currently, the pound is trading just a little bit higher, about a tenth of a percent higher this morning, 119 versus the US dollar, guilt's not a lot of action. You've got a two basis point move higher in yields at the front end, 3.02. At the 10 year, you're looking at 3.14 on guilt. We continue, of course, to monitor UK assets as we lead up to that autumn statement. Now, a China tech selloff led a slump in Asia stocks earlier today. Mill delivery giant May to Anfell after tencent pledged to distribute $20 billion of stock in the firm. With us to unpack this and more, we have Bloomberg's managing editor for Asia stocks lent in two. We're going to get to that shortly, but the context is 10cent, of course, a major investor across the tech space, not just in China, but in Asia as well, pledging then to offload a significant chunk of stocks in May to An. Another huge delivery app, really, another super app in China, and concerns from investors that this could lose lead to further divestments. For a company 10cent, which has really acted a bit like a major venture capital firm over the last ten years or so, so, so, is this the end of the rebound? We saw this aggressive rebound in Chinese tech at the early part of this week, or is it just a blip? I think I'm leading towards the latter. I think overall, we've seen a huge rebound in the Hansen Tech index in the past two weeks, right? 35 percent gain. I think it's a reasonable time for people to sort of take stock, consolidate, take profit, and now this week we're seeing a huge amount of earnings coming out, and that is a good opportunity for people to actually look at the fundamentals to see if the rally is really supported by earnings and the outlook of those companies. So, 10cent, as you mentioned, their earnings were actually decent, right? Revenue was a miss, but profit was a beat, and people were quite a beat about their advertisement sales, which was very difficult in this environment, but they managed to e-card a little bit of a gain, and today we'll see Alibaba coming out, and I think the expectation is for a growth in revenue after their first dip ever in the last quarter. Things may actually look relatively good going forward if the earnings are able to sustain the rebound in tech stocks. Okay, important context. Looking ahead to Alibaba, such an important kind of weather vein, and a gauge of sentiment in terms of e-commerce and sales there in China. Lenting, you're going to stick around. We're going to get a couple more questions to you, but I want to bring in JP Morgan Asset Management's global head of multi-asset strategy, John Bilton now, very pleased to say joining us in the studio. Good morning, John. I'm going to start with China. We're going to get your views on the 60-40-40 portfolio. I know you've got some interesting massively oversold. We saw that we got a little bit of incremental good news on the property sector, a little bit in terms of zero COVID, and as your previous speaker mentioned, we've seen Chinese assets shoot upwards, but they're still deeply undervalued at the moment. I think that's because there's still a lot of concern out there about where do we go with things like regulation, what is the fiscal stance within China, and what's the actual shape of pulling back from COVID-0, going to ultimately look like? I think as a result, there's concern generally around the globe in terms of thinking, at what point do I want to invest in China? If we look forward, China looks as if it could be a reasonably strong economy in the next 12 months, certainly compared with some of the concerns around recession in...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,156,2022-11-17 09:06:53
17543," China. So I think if we look forward, China looks as if it could be, you know, a reasonably strong economy in the next 12 months, certainly compared with some of the concerns around recession in the parts of the world, such as Europe, such as the States. So is it something that we look forward to as being potentially an area we'd be interested in? Absolutely. But I think at the moment there's still quite a lot of cross-currence that I think a lot of longer-term investors are still watching. Okay, so you're not ready. Maybe in 12 months time, but you want to see a bit more concrete evidence of some of these changes to be able to really have the confidence to dip your toes back in. Well, I think China's been hit pretty hard by a combination of things. Obviously, the regulatory changes in the tech sector, that the property situation and of course COVID-0. But there are some signs, if you look at some of the export data around the North Pacific Rim, beginning to show signs of a little bit of life. And clearly as we start to see a little bit of evidence that we're moving in a more positive trajectory, then I think investors generally will begin to re-examine China. But it's very much been a difficult market with essentially the economy partly shut down by COVID-0 to really sort of get a trend going in. Let's bring you back in at this point, because inflation has not been a problem for Chinese authorities for many a month. And yet the PBOC coming out today saying, warning that maybe inflation is creeping up and concerned that that may hamstring them at least restrict the ability for them to add additional stimulus and support for that economy. How much potentially is that ahead wind for China going forward? Yeah, it is quite interesting and it's a bit of a surprise for investors as well, because inflation has been quite subdued. I think China's inflation is probably the ranked the lowest among major economies in the world. The signal definitely means potentially higher bomb yields, right? And then we are actually seeing a little bit of a mini-bomb crisis going on, especially in the front end of the curve. And that was exacerbated by retail investors going to redeem their wealth management products. And if the bond yields continue to rise, that's not really good for funding environment in China, where China is trying to encourage banks to land and companies to borrow. Okay, NTN2, thank you for the analysis and the update on what's happening in China around the inflation dynamics and of course the tech story as well. John, I want to get your view then of course and let's bring it back to what's happening with the Federal Reserve, but before I get to the 64-bit question, so Mary daily saying, look, a pause is not in the cards, but you seem to get to the point where for some investors at least a slowdown, the analysis is you get a slowdown in the rate height cycle and that very quickly is followed by a pause. Is that a miscalculation by some of these market participants? I think there's a little bit of over excitement, if we're honest about it, in terms of where the Fed are going. Look, let's look at the facts. I mean, the labour market is still creating jobs at a level which is well in excess of trend growth in the US. And we need to go through a period, if we are to avoid a full-on recession, where there's a period of sub-trend growth. That means taking some of the steam out of the labour market. Clearly we've had some good news on inflation, which the Fed will have watched closely, but these things take time to accrue. We're not going to suddenly come collapsing down back to the Fed's target in terms of inflation. It's going to be a gradual move over the course of next year. So will the Fed slow their pace? Well, yes, of course. I mean, you're not going to carry on hiking at 75 basis points of meeting, adding for an item. But does that translate to a pause and then a reversal? That's where I think the market is perhaps getting over its skis. Does it translate to a pause somewhere in the five, five and a quarter kind of range? That seems sensible. But I think at that particular point, just remember, as inflation comes down next year, sometimes during the first half, the front end of the curve will go from negative real rates to positive real rates. And that's going to mean that some of the restrictive financial conditions, which have been hamstringing markets for much of this year, are likely to persist. So it does feel as if markets perhaps are a little bit over-interpreting where the Fed go from here, where a pause is sensible, a pivot, probably not. But that five and a quarter percent call on terminal rate from Goldman seems reasonable to you at this point. Well, certainly where pricing's coming in, I mean, look, at the end of the day, at 475-535-535 and a quarter, 5 and a quarter, 535 and a half, it translates to a similar kind of picture, which is, you know, but for a little bit of rounding, a positive real interest rate at the f***.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,157,2022-11-17 09:11:09
17544," 535 and a quarter 5 and a quarter 535 and a half. It translates to a similar kind of picture, which is, you know, but for a little bit arounding a positive real interest rate at the front of the US curve at the beginning, you know, during the first half of next year. 6040, I still have it ringing my ears, John, from last year. The number of strategists and analysts and fund managers we had, I was like, the 60 portfolio strategy, it's just dead in the water. You say it's now back. Is that a call on the end of the bond market route or is that a call on equities? Well, I think it's more than that, because I mean, you know, it's the usual marked, plain thing, you know, you know, rumors of death being much exaggerated in the case of the 6040. It's actually more a question of actually being able to look again at the longer term. We've gone through a period, is that a two-year horizon for you, right? This is a 10-year horizon. So we think that a US dollar, 6040-based portfolio, global stocks, US aggregate bonds, should be able to deliver around 7.2% expected return on average over the next 10 years. And at the moment, we've had a year where everybody's been in the bunker, looking at short-term moves, what the Fed doing, where's inflation going. And we were simply encouraged and say, look, it's been a tough year. We know that. The 6040 suffered a 19% drawdown from top to tail. The S&P 500 lost the equivalent in market cap of Germany, Japan and Canada put together, okay? This has been a tough old year. But we would argue that as we look forward, as we look at longer-term projections, yields are now above their equilibrium level, valuation excesses with the equity market of unwound. The underlying assets themselves are not fundamentally broken. This is not 2008, where the banks had gone bang, or 2012, where countries around Europe were in distress. This is a question of simply resetting some of the dislocations that had existed for a long time. So we would simply encourage folks to begin to look again at the long term. Yes, we've got a tough year ahead. I don't doubt that. A lot of volatility to come, a lot of uncertainty. But to begin to plan for the long term, we've finally got a place where the 6040, the liquid asset markets are beginning to allow us to achieve long-term portfolio objectives. Okay, 7% annual returns, above 7% annual returns over a 10, 15-year period on 6040 as the call from JP Morgan, John Pilton. Thank you very much indeed for coming to the studio ahead of global multi-asset strategy at, of course, JP Morgan asset management. Of course, we're speaking as well to Bloomberg's Linty and two, given us the latest on China. Now, coming up, we're going to hear from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who spoke with Bloomberg's editor and chief John Mikkelfrey from the new economic forum in Sing-A-Pore. Do not miss. That interview, this is Bloomberg. China's military power has been growing at an incredible speed over the last 20 years. A strong country must have a strong military, as only then can it guarantee the security of the nation. In terms of sphere of influence, we absolutely know that China wants to be dominant in Asia. So there is a target to get to that point, to be a military that is appear to the greatest militaries in the world by 2035. The competition for influence is a global one. And through a multi-decade trajectory fueled by planning, money, and pragmatism, China is building a military that allows it to shape the 21st century just as the US shaped the 20th. Do not want to see a nuclear force in the US.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,158,2022-11-17 09:15:24
17545," My team thinks 2023 we avoid a recession. I'm a little more skeptical about that. China and the US both do not want to see nuclear force in the European continent. The regulators here in the Bahá'uá is ongoing with their investigation into FTX. With unmatched reach in resources from more than 120 countries, the moment news breaks 24 hours a day. Bloomberg, your global business authority. The top names at the Fed are on Bloomberg. I think it will probably be appropriate soon to move to a slower pace of increases. But we have additional work to do. Nobody covers the Fed like Bloomberg. We would really want to hear that the perpetrator country is a Russian Federation. We would be happy if the state could be named Speed. China and the United States has two major countries both stand to gain from cooperation and lose from confrontation. We are at the beginning of a bridge building effort. As we look at supply chains around the world, they were fit for 20 to 30 years ago. The central banks misread the signs. They misread the risk of persistent and much higher implementation. My team for choice, things 2023, we avoid a recession. I'm a little more skeptical. We're going to have new and improved data access protocols, such that only an entity of US residents that in the US will have access to a sudden set of US protected data. Crypto industry has been cut to ribbons this year. It's just too risky to sit out with a bunch of cowboys who have managed to blow themselves up. OK, hearing now about the top risks that dominated talks among business and policy leaders at the new economy forum in Singapore. Now, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, was also speaking there to Bloomberg on the final day of the new economy forum. He says the war with Russia will end only when Crimea and Donbass are returned to Ukraine. Our war is the war for our lives. As you do remember, the scale of occupation by Russia, of our territory, and what happened since the 24th of February, and our objective was to stay strong and bring back the life and peace on our land. Unless we deoccupied the whole territory, this will not bring peace to us. Unfortunately, this is the leader of Russian Federation. This is his decision. We see this. They don't want Ukraine to develop. Ukraine has chosen its way forward and it will develop. And it is developing. In some areas, we're developing master, even during the war, then Russia Federation, which doesn't have war on its soil. And so, for the stability of the situation for our country, we have to say certain steps. And I think that restoration of territorial integrity of our country is one of those important steps to be made. And also the support of international community investment, etc. To be absolutely clear about it, deoccupying, as you put it, includes Crimea. It is an important difference because it will be taking the border back to where it was, the effective border, where it was in 2014. Is that your starting point before peace can happen? Crimea is part of Ukraine. This is not just a state within a state. It's part of our country and part of our sovereignty. That's what it is.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,159,2022-11-17 09:19:44
17546," Ukraine. This is not just a state within a state. It's part of our country and part of our sovereignty. Therefore, indeed, the occupation of the Crimea and Donbass will bring the end to the war. And that, of course, was Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky in conversation with Bloomberg editor-in-chief John Mikhailovich on the final day of the Bloomberg New Economy Forum in Singapore. Now the fallout from the rapid collapse of FTX is spreading across the crypto world, ensnaring the binulair Winklevoss twins through a liquidity squeeze at their lending partner, Genesis. Joining me now is Bloomberg's Svveshri Gosh. Svveshri, what are the contagion risks that are unraveling now? These Winklevoss twins, they were meant to be the grownups in the room when it came to the world of crypto. Indeed, they were and many more. So, seriously, FTX filed for bankruptcy and it has been a week since then. And we are seeing the contagion risks continue to spill over around from crypto exchanges to crypto brokerages. It was with Genesis. Genesis is a crypto brokerage which had to halt withdrawals. And after that, you know, that spilled over to its lender, Gemini which is as you said, the Winklevosses billionaire owned company. So there you see that, you know, there is an earned product. Gemini has an earned product and $700 million worth of tokens are invested through this earned product on Genesis. And that is how the spillover risk has now moved to Gemini which is also seeing quite a bit of withdrawals from its overall exchange platform. So it is still evolving story. We are seeing lots of, you know, contagion risks spreading around. We don't know the next when, the next shoe will drop to be honest. But yes, it doesn't look like it is going to end soon. And how the crypto market is kind of repricing this volatility and this uncertainty? Now at least today the crypto market has been pretty much stable. We are seeing the Bitcoin price around, you know, $17,000 level which is pretty much a steady level. It looks like for some time at least the crypto markets have built in, priced in the volatility from the contagion. However, we never know because, you know, there is the bankruptcy filing risks from several other companies that we already are here in the name slide block fire and Gemini, sorry, Genesis. So there could be some kind of more volatility we can wait for in the crypto market as well. But for today it was priced in. Yeah, maybe a brief, a very brief fleeting moment of calm across these crypto markets. Bloomberg's, Suresh Rigot, thank you for giving us the latest on the fallout of course of the collapse of FTX.

17547," How much I got pushed have you seen from the Kishirah government in terms of green funding? The Kishirah administration has committed to doubling the amount of investments in so-called green technologies. I think we need more than just pronouncements. We need real money backing, very innovative startups, and innovative companies in this space. What do you make of Kishirah's new capitalism? I think he is framework is reflective of the challenges that Japan society is facing, namely that growth has been present, but growth has not been of course evenly distributed. But frankly speaking, it's hard to register the income if you don't have a income to begin with. If the government and private sector can work together and collaborate to drive more innovative growth startups, that can really drive the income growth that the Kishirah government needs to redistribute.

We tend to believe that all consumers are equal. They are now. Look for Chief Future Officer on Bloomberg. Good morning and welcome to Bloomberg UK. A new show with a special focus on the biggest challenges facing the British government, economy, financial services and markets. I'm Tom McKenzie in London. Now when Chancellor Jeremy Hunt delivers the autumn statement later today, he has one big mission. Restore the UK's credibility with financial markets. That, of course, after Liz Trust and Quasic Quartons disastrous, many budget back in September. In the off thing, a big package of spending cuts and tax rises. The challenge. Curbing rampant inflation without pushing the economy into an even greater downturn than in already faces. To help navigate all of these topics for us, we've got a panel of experts. First, let's hand out to Westminster to get the latest then from our UK correspondent Lizzie Bird news on the ground for us. Lizzie, give us the big picture. What can we expect from this all important fiscal statement today? The drumbeat has been going on in the background for a number of weeks. Well, Tom, we can expect austerity on steroids. We've been getting lots and lots of briefings about the content of this autumn statement. That's the classic Rishi Sunak playbook from when he was Chancellor, not to shock the markets. And the new Chancellor Jeremy Hunt says that there are eye-wateringly difficult decisions ahead today in terms of tax rises and spending cuts because he needs to balance the books. Now, I spoke to the new Treasury Select Committee Chairwoman Harriet Baldwin earlier. Here she is explaining why that's necessary. I think it's really important that the UK demonstrate today that we can pay our way. And after the guardrails, it's as you put them, sort of slightly fell away during September and October, that we are back on track and well-guarded on all sides by the institutional strength of the United Kingdom. But the Chancellor really is walking a very fine line between pleasing the markets and pleasing the voters and the economic reality is if he's going to tame inflation, he's going to have to weigh on demand. Lizzie, we often get in these autumn statements. The Chancellor pulling a proverbial rabbit out of the hat. Are we expecting any surprises this time around? Well, Jeremy Hunt has said there wouldn't be a rabbit coming out of the heart today, but there are a number of questions that we want and...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,162,2022-11-17 09:32:49
17549," Is this time around? Well, Jeremy Hunt has said there wouldn't be a rabbit coming out of the heart today, but there are a number of questions that we want answers to. What will be the balance between tax rises and spending cuts? Is he going to backload some of this austerity until after the 2024 general election? And how will that go down with markets? Is he going to overcompensate in plugging the fiscal gap? Who's going to be hit by these tax rises? Who's going to benefit from support? But it's classic Rishi Sunak to underpromise over deliver. You can perhaps expend some extra billions of pounds on, as I think it was Alex Wickham who reported, making homes more energy efficient to reduce energy demand. And also, Rishi Sunak has said that his top priority is inflation. He seems to be a bit confused whether it's inflation or controlling him in illegal immigration, but close behind those is education. So you can perhaps expend some more spending there. OK, we're going to be bringing in Alex Wickham very shortly for his analysis as well, Lizzie. Before we do that, one last question on the back loading of some of these measures then, and the thinking behind that, what is the rationale for pushing back some of these spending cuts, some of these tax rises? Well, it's a naked attempt to win over the public, because no one wants to return to austerity. Labour's already calling it austerity 2.2, but by saying that it is going to happen at some point, the chancellor will be hoping that the markets will be convinced that this fiscal largest isn't just going to be inflated away as perhaps was the thinking with the mini budget in September, hence the markets who are loyal then. OK, Lizzie Burden, on the ground for us, of course, outside the hands of the parliament, leading up to that important statement, of course, the autumn statement. Let's bring in now Alex Wickham, our BN reporter, who, of course, is incredibly well-sourced and has been following all of these things for us for a very long time, and it's kind of well, very well-breaked on what we can expect. Alex, we were talking in the break about the fact that there's been leak after leak in the build up to this statement. How much of that is about putting some kind of boundaries around the expectations, there's going to be a lot of pain, this is about softening that public reaction for what is going to be a brutal autumn statement. Absolutely. We've heard a lot in the papers over last couple of weeks about things that Jeremy Hunt is considering, and things that Treasury officials are supposed to do looking at, things like putting the top rate of income tax up to 50p, which would be, for a Tory government, a pretty extraordinary thing to do. And certainly speaking to conservative MPs, they simply don't believe that that's a genuine thing that's under consideration. What they think that is is a bit of a kite flown by the Treasury through the media to sort of say, well, look, it could be even worse. Look at what we could be doing. You know, I know you're not going to like what's in the autumn statement, but at least we didn't do XYZ. However, the reality is that whatever comes out today, rises in council tax, things like that. Those are very tough politically for conservatives to be putting on the public and their own voters. Okay, Alex is staying with us for more on the political angle for this as well. But let's bring in our Gemma Tetlow, who's chief economist at the Institute for Governments. And of course, we'll continue to get back to Alex for the political lines on this story. Gemma, thank you for joining us this morning. What is your analysis of the impact on the economy and growth as we look into 2023? We don't have the autumn statement yet, but a lot has been flagged. What is your forecast at this point? I mean, as you've already been discussing, the government faces a very tricky balancing act here to show credibility on the public finances, get boring and debt under control, whilst not unnecessarily aggravating the recession that's coming. But we are in a situation where the Bank of England thinks that we need an economic slowdown to get inflation under control. So actually, it's quite likely that a lot of any fiscal action wouldn't be offset by monetary policy. So if the government goes for a looser stance on fiscal policy, then that could result in some more high interest rates than otherwise would be the case in vice versa. If the government goes tight on fiscal policy, there is some scope for the Bank of England to offset that. So there are lots of dynamics going on here. And obviously, one important factor for households is energy prices over the next year or so. So I think one, probably the focus of government support in the near term will be what they do for any...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,163,2022-11-17 09:37:15
17550," factor for households is energy prices over the next year or so. So I mean, one, probably the focus of government of support in the near term will be what do they do for energy bills beyond April? We know the energy price guarantee is currently set out ends at the end of March. So what does he, what does pump due to support households with those short term costs of living whilst at the same time getting public finances back almost for a sustainable part? So, and that's rising, of course, we saw the CPI print yesterday, 11.1% coming well above the forecast, Gemma. On the question of energy, how much scope does the government have to expand that cap beyond April? If it becomes more targeted, do we have a sense of what the drag will be then on inflation in the quarters beyond April? Obviously, the enterprise guarantee by bringing down near term energy costs in a sense, slightly extends the period over which we see higher inflation, because it takes longer for that to drop out rather than having a big short term spike and then dropping back, we see a bit more of a prolonged period of somewhat higher inflation. The possible danger of that is that people start to build it into their expectations more that the longer a high inflation goes on, the more they expect that to continue. However, from sort of what could they do, physically? I think it would be interesting to see. Okay, so now that we may have a technical problem with Gemma, Gemma, we'll just try and check your line, because you just dropped out there for a second, so our technical team will check in on that. I want to bring back in Alex Wicken then for the politics of this. Alex, there is a sense, and Lizzie was saying that describing it as kind of naked, politicking around the back loading of some of these measures, post, of course, the election has to be held by January 2025 or the latest. How confident is the Conservative Party that they can close this polling gap with Labour, given that they seem to be looking at some of the policy measures that the Labour-government opposition Labour Party, I should say, have touted themselves whether it's a windfall tax on energy or more support for lower income households. I think the answer is not very confident. Yeah, the dual challenge of this autumn statement is that, yes, they've got to calm the markets, but they've also got to give something to voters to make them think that there's a point in voting conservative at the next election. If all they're getting is sort of managed to climb, you know, after 12 years of Tory government, this is the best we can do. This is where we're leaving the country heading into the next election. That is a very tough sale to the public. And these are tax risers across the board with spending cuts. And whether they're felt in time for the election or not, that is the mood music that we'll have going into it. And certainly speaking to Tory MPs and advisors over the last couple of weeks, they are very glum about the prospects of any sort of positive message or strategy for the public. How do you sell this to the public in any other way, other than we messed up? And it's going to be painful. And no doubt they'll be watching the polls very quickly or very closely after this autumn statement. They currently have a deficit. What about 20 basis points, 20 points in the polls versus the opposition Labour Party? Very pleased to say we're now joined by Andrew Sentence, Senior Advisor to Cambridge Equinonctrix. And of course, importantly, former member of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee. Good morning, Andrew. Thanks for coming into the studio. What is your level of confidence that the UK Chancellor can both reassure the markets and avoid a complete collapse of UK public services? Well, as you're indicating, he's got a quite a difficult balancing act to do. He obviously has to show that the government has a grip on public finances that they have an idea of where the economy is going, which is realistic, which will probably need to factor in some form of recession over the next 12 to 18 months. But at the same time, they've got to also make sure that the public spending and tax numbers add up. I think all the rhetoric from the Liz Trust's camp about tax cuts is really off the agenda. The question is how many tax, you know, how much tax rising do we need to balance the books? And as your question suggests, that you can't just continually squeeze public spending. That was not very successful after the global financial crisis. So there needs to be some restraint of public spending, which will need to be quite targeted, so that it doesn't fall on areas that are very sensitive.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,164,2022-11-17 09:41:33
17551," So there needs to be some restraint of public spending, which will need to be quite targeted, so that it doesn't fall on areas that are very sensitive, like health and education, which are also important for the running of the economy. But going too far in terms of squeezing public spending and cutting back on public investment would not be good for the economy. And we saw that print, the inflation print yesterday, 11.1%. The Prime Minister says it's his number one target to tackle inflation. And we know that B.O.E. and Andrew Bailey, of course, very closely focused on this as well. Do you, is your assessment that inflation, though I wateringly high yesterday, is now peaking in the UK? Well, it's close to the peak that the Bank of England indicated. They suggested an average of 10.9% over the three months, October to December, and perhaps a little bit higher. But I think the main thing about inflation is it's going to not be until the middle of next year, when it really starts to come down significantly. So it's going to be over 10% until the middle of next year, according to the bank's forecast. You say that the bank is focused on controlling inflation, but they haven't done a very good job so far. And they were very slow at raising interest rates last year. And I think they've been overcourcious in terms of getting a grip on inflation. It's not primarily Jeremy Hunt's job to get on top of inflation. That's the job of the Bank of England. What he needs to do is provide a stable backdrop so the bank can do its job. So we don't want big lurches in public spending or taxation in one direction or the other in the short term. OK, and I want to get back to your views on the need for additional rate hikes and how the BLE is behind the curve on this. But I want to bring back in Jemma at this point. Jemma, Tetlo from the Institute for Guldman. Jemma, you touched on this when we spoke a couple of minutes ago. Are you starting on the labour market and the strength of the labour market here in the UK and what that challenges that poses to the inflation dynamics? Are you starting to see evidence is that coming through in the data of a wage price spiral? One of the problems that's definitely facing the UK is tightness in the labour market. And that's lurches in a lot of people dropping out of the labour market after the pandemic. And some of that seems to be more health related. So a lot of these challenges are interrelated. And for example, backlogs in the health service are probably not helping people to get healthier again and get back to work. And that is causing more pressure on inflation because of the tight labour market. It's difficult say there's really any evidence of wage price spirals. I think we are in a very different world from the 1970s when we last had a little oil price shock because there's very low rates of unionisation and much less widespread collective bargaining on wages, which makes it less likely we're going to say wage price spiral emerging. Andrew, let's bring it back to rate heights then with that backdrop around the tightness of the labour market. Four and a half percent seems to be what the market certainly Bloomberg economics are looking at four and a half percent as the terminal rate for the B.O.E. Is that enough to get inflation back down to target? Well, I'm not sure it will be enough. You're quite right to say that many people are looking at somewhere between four and a five percent. Where interest rates will go in the short term. But the question is then if they get there say within the next three to six months, is that going to be sufficient to bring down inflation with the latest numbers showing inflation over 11 percent. RPI inflation is 14.2 percent. These are eye watering figures. And it does suggest to me that interest rates will need to go possibly above five percent, perhaps into the six to seven percent range. You know, in by the middle of next year in order to get a grip on inflation. That's quite possible. Yes. I'm not saying that's nailed on. But that's the sort of range that people need to think is quite possible. What kind of depth of recession does a 67 percent translate to then? Well, I think that depends a lot on what's going on on other fronts like the state of the world economy, what's happening with energy prices, etc. But it's certainly not going to be helpful to the real economy. And it's going to be.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,165,2022-11-17 09:45:53
17552," What's happening with energy prices, etc. But it's certainly not going to be helpful to the real economy. And it's going to be a big shock for many households and firms. Now I'm not saying that's my central forecast, but that's the risk forecast that if we can't get on top of inflation, that's where the Bank of England may need to go.

Now, coming up more on UK personal finance ahead of the Chancellor's Autumn Budget Statement. Stay with us for that. This is Bloomberg. Why is everybody want to be a consultant? And what are all these consultants doing? Well, David, I think that we actually defy the label consultant because sometimes consultant seems to imply that we only give advice. And when you look at what Accenture does, we're really different than the traditional version of a consultant. We're really about relevance and results. And that's what is driving our business. What about a consulting project? In my example, I'm the CEO, I have a problem, I call you up, I say, solve my problem or give me a solution. We don't operate as big companies permanently in crisis mode. And so when you think about, like, how long does it solve things? A lot of it starts with, you know, the company being willing to set aggressive goals. And so what we are trying to do now is work with our clients to work differently and to work faster.

A strong country must have a strong military, as only then can it guarantee the security of the nation. In terms of sphere of influence, we absolutely know that China wants to be dominant in Asia. So there is a target to get to that point, to be a military that is appear to the greatest militaries in the world by 2035. The competition for influence is a global one. And through a multi-decade trajectory fueled by planning, money, and pragmatism, China is building a military that allows it to shape the 21st century just as the US shaped the 20th.

Of course, his ultimate budget statement today as he wrestles with inflation at 11.1% in the year to October. That is the highest in more than four decades, 41 years. Joining us now, I am pleased to welcome Bloomberg's John Steppeck, who looks at all things personal finance and the implications of the macroeconomics and monetary policy on personal finance. John, what can we expect then? What are you looking at from the autumn statement? From your perspective? The main thing from my perspective is fiscal drag. There is a great quote from the chap who was Louis XIV's finance minister. We are going all the way back to Louis XIV. All the way back to Jean-Pak, he is called Bair. He basically said the act of taxation consists in so plucking the goose as to obtain the largest possible amount of feathers with the smallest possible amount of hissing. Basically, where the goose and hunt is the feather plucker and there is another full lot of plucking to be done, unfortunately. I mean, fiscal drag is what happens when you freeze tax thresholds. And all that happens then is that more and more people end up paying the taxes as a result of inflation rather than because their real wealth has gone up. This is the stealth tax. Yes, it's stealth tax. I mean, it's sneaky, but it does work because it doesn't tend to hit people immediately. This effects will become a part of the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,167,2022-11-17 09:54:41
17554," It's a stealth tax, I mean it's sneaky, but it does work because it doesn't tend to hit people immediately. It's effects only become a pardon over time, but at the same time it raises a lot of money. I mean there's one good example, so the 45% tax rate, additional tax rate, top rate income tax in the UK, over the past 10 years the threshold for that hasn't changed. So you pay it once a year and above £150,000 a year. Now in 2013, 2014 tax year, 311,000 people paid that. That is projected for the 2022-23 tax year, there would be 629,000 people. So it's doubled over the course of a decade, and that's purely because the threshold hasn't changed. You know, if the threshold had gone up with inflation, then the number of taxpayers paying it would also not have risen as rapidly as that. And a similar impact further down this scale from things like child benefit. So once someone in your household earns above £50,000, if you get kids, you know, you get child benefit, it used to be a universal benefit. Now it's gradually withdrawing as soon as someone in the household earns above 50,000. Now again, that threshold hasn't changed since it was introduced, and the number of tax payers that it captures is going up from about 750,000 to nearly a million households now. So it basically makes it poorer over time, but we don't notice it is much because... It's good news for the Treasury. It's good, and it's great news for the Treasury. John, give us the strategies, give us the tips for avoiding this upcoming storm that's about to be unleashed. Or there's already being unleashed on households around the UK. What can we do? Well, this is the tricky thing. I hate said, but you really, all you, what you really need to do is be on top of your personal finances, in a way that I think that we've perhaps got out the habit of over the last 10 years or so. So in the last 10 years, for example, we haven't had to worry about inflation. We haven't had to worry particularly about savings rates because there haven't been any. So for example, if you've had cash in your savings account, you've got used to paying 0% and not really thinking about it. Now you can probably get about 4.5% if you've shop around. So even although you're still getting hammered in wheel turns after inflation, at least it's not as bad as it could be.

This is Bloomberg surveillance, early edition with Anna Edwards, Matt Miller, and Kayleigh Lyne's. It's 10 a.m. in London, 5 a.m. in New York, and 6 p.m. in Hong Kong, our top stories today. Budget Day in the UK, Jeremy Hunt will try to reassure markets he can stabilize public finances without devastating cuts in government services. The crypto crisis spreads, the fallout from the collapse of FTX has now ensnared the billionaire Vincolvost twins. And a power shift on Capitol Hill, Republicans narrowly regain control of the House, giving them the ability to block President Biden's agenda. Welcome to Bloomberg's surveillance, early edition, I'm Anna Edwards in London with Matt Miller and Kayleigh Lyne's in New York. We reflect on the market moves of yesterday, Kayleigh, and concerns once again about the Fed and the extensive tightening we're going to see. And Mark is pretty muted this morning with that in mind. Of course, the focus here on the autumn statements. Yeah, we're waiting for that to come up in just about an hour and a half's time in us. So definitely markets in the UK and really around the world will be paying attention to that. But as you say, muted sentiment overall, and it was definitely in the more downward direction in the Asian session overnight, stocks there broadly lower the MSTI Asia Pacific index down by about eight tenths of one percent. One of the biggest drags within Asian equities was Chinese technology stocks, the Hong Kong tech index down about 2.2 percent. Now, part of that had to do with May-Twan shares dropping after 10 cents an ounce of announcement yesterday that it's going to offload about $20 billion of those shares. So that dragged overall. But Chinese equities more broadly were hurt by a PBOC statement about inflation saying it could pick back up as demand in the economy revives itself. So that indicates that the scope for monetary policy using may be",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,169,2022-11-17 10:03:14
17556," by a PBOC statement about inflation, saying it could pick back up as demand in the economy revives itself. So that indicates that the scope for monetary policy easing may be limited. And of course, you also have seen a lot of movement in the short end of the government bond curve in China, the two-year yield now at 216, which is the highest since August. And you actually have Chinese regulators asking banks about their ability to meet obligations given the bond sell-off we have seen. So that is a story to watch. Finally in foreign exchange, I would note that the offshore yuan is one of the big underperformers against the US dollar, though basically all currencies in Asia and G10 are weaker against the dollar today, but the yuan being one of them, weakening by about six tens of 1% were at the 715 level at the moment. Matt. All right. Take a look at what's going on in S&P futures. We are down after the finish down yesterday in the cash trade. I think we are around 3952 on the S&P. And it looks like we could come further away from that 4,000 level as markets are dissuaded by Fed speakers about counting on a pause if not a pivot. The Bloomberg dollar index also a headwind rising up again today to 1278. The US 10-year yield also a headwind rising up today to 372, although it should be said that we've been seeing 380s over the last few sessions. And it's much better than the 4 and change that we had seen before last week. So even though yields are rising on the 10-year, they're still really low compared to what we've seen over the past weeks and months. Bitcoin right now is down about one tenth of 1% still hovering around the same level that it was yesterday and the day before at what's today Wednesday. No, today's Thursday. And the day before Bitcoin has just been hanging around 16,000 and change ever since the dramatic collapse of FTX. And it doesn't seem to be any more or less volatile than S&P, which has also been hovering around the same levels all week. Anna, what do you see in Europe? Yeah, it will definitely first day here in Europe, Matt. I can confirm. Don't do that to us. Don't make us do it all again. We've got the London market underperforming basic resources under pressure today in keeping with a slight slip in that global risk appetite and that's weighing on those global resource stocks. So we're down by half a percent in London, down by half a percent on the cat carons also in Paris. The German market really stands out though by a quarter of 1%. And it is one of the heavyweight German names that is taking us there. We'll come to that. In fact, let's go to that now. The Siemens is up by 6.6% today and this is having a big upward impact on that German market. The engineering giant reporting numbers and it seems that it's the factory automation side of things that's really delighted the investor community and certainly have seen some very positive broker comments and analysts comment as a result of that. Burberry, I also put this one in here, not for the Chevrolet's move as you can see it's not moving very much. But an interesting story, they reported numbers earlier on. There's been a change of changing of the guard at Burberry recently and they talked about bringing back the Britishness. Now, I don't know what that means, but I'm sure they do. So that'll be interesting to watch. The euro is down by 3.10% 1.065. So just backing away from that 104 handle. Interesting reporting by our Bloomberg colleagues tracking the ECB story saying that perhaps we'll see a downshift from the ECB from 75 to 50. I spoke to Polarini, wealth management earlier on and they were saying that would be their view because they don't think that the ECB or the Bank of England will want to do more than the Fed. So the Fed down shifts we couldn't expect the same elsewhere is what they were saying. Talking of the Bank of England, they'll be closely watching the pound, they'll be watching guilt markets and they'll be closely keeping their eye on what's going on in Westminster with the UK Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said to deliver his autumn statement. So with all of that in mind, I put a focus on UK assets. We will focus later today on the House of Commons. Jeremy Hunt will be attempting to reassure markets. He can stabilize UK public finances without inflicting devastating damage on public services. Bloomberg's Lizzy Burden joins us now from Westminster. Lizzy, give us the big picture then. What can we expect to see in this fiscal statement today? I know what we can't expect is austerity on steroids. Most of this statement seems to have already been brief. That's classic Rishi Sunak from when he was Chancellor and the new Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has said that we're expecting eye-wateringly difficult decisions in terms of spending cuts and tax rises. Apologies, there's the same old protest that we see every week in Westminster behind me.

Here she is explaining why that's so important It's really important that the UK demonstrate today that we can pay our way and after the guardrail that says you put them sort of slightly fell away during September and October that we are back on on track and well guarded on all sides by the institutional strength of the United Kingdom But Jeremy Hunt is facing into the storm as we have been briefed he has to tame inflation But that will require weighing on demand so it's a very very fine line between pleasing the markets and pleasing the voters Yeah, I don't envy Mr. Hunt. It's going to be very difficult. Where can we see some surprises Lizzie? Well, there are lots of questions that we're waiting for the answers to what will be the balance between tax rises and spending cuts How much of this fiscal squeeze will be backloaded until after the 2024 general election? Who's going to bear the brunt of these tax rises? Who actually has the broadest shoulders in the government's mind? And is the Chancellor going to overcompensate in terms of plugging this fiscal gap that will all be Very closely watched by the markets, but really we also need to see are they over relying on this closeness now Renewed between the Treasury and the UK's economic institutions. Are they taking liberties with the dullest dividend? All right, Lizzie. Thanks very much Bloomberg's Lizzie burden there reporting on the autumn What do you call it the autumn statement correct the autumn statement coming out all of a sudden we all know what this is after well Liz trusted one great thing for the UK all right Ukraine's prime President I should say of a lot of mirrors Zalensky has laid out his conditions for peace Zalensky says ceasefire Won't be enough and only the return of territory taken by Russia will allow and end to the war speaking at the Bloomberg New Economy Forum in Singapore Zalensky also weighed in on the missile that struck Poland earlier this week I don't know what happened this time we don't know 100% I think the world also does know what happened 100% in that situation But I'm sure that this is a Russian missile and I'm sure that we were launching the Air Defense missiles, but we can't say specifically that this was the air defense of Ukraine although we are grateful for not being blamed Because we are fighting against the Russian missiles in our territory, but nevertheless We have to be fair and honest Until the investigation is over. We can't say what kind of missile or what pieces of which a missile fell on the Polish territory Let's get to Bloomberg's angry Horderns. She remains in Bali after the G20 meetings there. So Emory What else did we hear from Zalensky in the speech and the interview that followed? Well, he's really just rejecting these claims by the US Poland NATO that for sure what it looks like in terms of the evidence that this was a Ukrainian defense system That was shooting down a barrage of Russian missiles that ended up in Poland and what Zalensky says is he wants Kiev to be a part of the investigation. He also wants to send Ukrainian officials to Poland But the president when he landed back at the White House overnight very late last night He said that's not the evidence So the US is looking at the evidence several US officials said this is what it does seem to be They obviously call this an unfortunate situation. You've heard that throughout the past 24 hours But it's kind of an intense Awkward moment because you have Zalensky really pitting himself in terms of what has gone what happened in Poland Against his main allies and that is of course the US and all of NATO Back in Washington where you spend most of your time Emory We have of course a changing of the gardener sense in the house the GOP retaking the US House By a slim margin in a power shift in Washington that stops shorter the Senate of course. What difference does this make?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,171,2022-11-17 10:11:53
17558," be retaking the U.S. House by a slim margin in a power shift in Washington that stops shores of the Senate, of course. What difference does this make? Yeah, they got that magic number 218, Yashan, or Republican was able to maintain his seat in California. It is not the red wave that the Republicans were predicting, but still, a majority is a majority. And that means they have control of these councils that will be able to subpoena, either individuals from the Biden administration, or also his family, individuals from the Biden family, including potentially his son, Hunter Biden. This has been something the Republicans have been talking about. So that is what you can expect. When it comes to the markets, what everyone really will probably start to focus on is the fact that we have the debt ceiling issue, and the Republicans may use this opportunity to use that hostage to force the president to enact spending cuts. But the president, on Air Force One, on his way home from Bali, where I do still remain, this is what he had to say when the Republicans clinched the House. He said, I congratulate Leader McCarthy on Republicans winning the House majority, and I'm ready to work with House Republicans and deliver results for working families. So the president says he will work with anyone when it comes to tackling big issues. Another important moment. This, of course, means that Speaker Pelosi will no longer be speaker. And she says her office says she has an announcement today about her future plan. So stay tuned for that. All right, Bloomberg's Ann Rehorder, and still reporting from Bali. Thank you so much for joining us. Let's turn now to the world of crypto former FTX CEO Sam Bankman Fried is telling his side of the company's collapse. And he's doing it through a series of tweets. SPF admitted that FTX got overconfident and careless and said he would do his best to save customer's cash and not just to give a little color on what he said exactly happened. He essentially said the crash came in a few day period. The historic crash almost 50% and most correlated assets with no bit side liquidity at the same time that there was a run on the bank. So in summary, $13 billion of leverage total run on the bank total collapse and asset value all at once, which is why you don't want that leverage. So basically just kind of a worse nightmare scenario. And we continue to see the dominoes falling in the crypto world. Yeah, what five Genesis Gemini. Yeah, yeah, and I think it's really interesting that you see Gemini and Genesis getting hit as well. So these are more people that we thought were very serious players. I'm not saying they aren't, but they definitely were willing to take exposure to Sam Bankman Fried just through his fame alone. As he said, he was on the cover of every magazine. The thing I find really fascinating is that it seems as if SBF is still under the impression that Seeram, Solana and FTT that he holds on this balance sheet or the FTX or Alameda hold on their balance sheet is worth $3.3 billion. He doesn't understand that the value of that stuff has just dumped. Yeah, absolutely. Interesting stuff. And then to think about where we go from here, what role does Binance play? And I know we talked in the past about what role there is for consolidation in this sector. What need there is in a world that likes to remain decentralized. What happens when you centralize so much of it under one person under CZ? And we now see Binance is preparing a bit for Voyager Digital at least according to CoinDesk. Kaley. All right, Anna. So definitely continuing to keep in mind all the twist and concerns of that saga. But let's now take a look back at the equity market and some stocks moving in here in the US because there's a trio of them moving to the upside after earnings. The first being Cisco, which top estimates and gave a bullish revenue forecast signals that there is still technology spending going on among corporate customers. That stock up about 4%. You also have Nvidia higher after its results. Yes, there is softness in the PC chip market, but AI and data center business really giving a lift to the company's revenue. So they also top expectations that that stock is higher by about 2.3%. And one final stock to mention, grab. This is the Southeast Asian ride hailing company. It reported a smaller narrower loss than expected. Cost cuts finally kicking in and helping with that bottom line. So that stock up about 2.5% before the bell. Anna. Coming up on the program, we'll focus in on what to expect from the autumn statement. Today, a budget by any other name basically Chris Hair joins us. HSBC, Senior Economist will get his perspective on what the UK does from here.

17559," Statements, a budget by any other name. Chris H.S.B.C. Senior Economist will get his perspective on what the UK does from here. How big is the hole in the fiscal story here in the UK that needs to be filled by the Chancellor today and what role will the physical drag play in filling it? We'll get to that shortly. Yes, she's late back. While Tesla's in the like make for good headlines, the reality is that even if every car on the roads today won't be electric, it wouldn't be enough to curb global emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change. greenhouse gas emissions from transportation account for about 29% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. So what about the other 71%? Building across America burned fossil fuels to operate. What we want to do is make that all electric. Instead of burning oil and gas to give us the energy and electricity we need, we want to do 100% clean energy, all electric. We want to turn buildings into Tesla's. Just like a Tesla or an electric vehicle is all electric with no fossil fuels, we want to do that with our buildings. If we can do it in one building, we can do it in all buildings. And if we do it in all buildings, we'll reduce 30% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Bloomberg is live at COP27 in Charm El Sheikh Egypt.

Radio coverage continues only on Bloomberg, your global business authority. Welcome back to Bloomberg's surveillance, the early addition on Matt Miller, Kaley Lions here in New York, Anna Edwards with us out of London. And the focus is firmly back on the UK today, we're all looking forward to Jeremy Hunt's autumn statement. I have a chart of debt to GDP and it's interesting to see that the UK is actually doing really well compared to the U.S. We're looking at just about 99% debt to GDP for the UK in white in blue. The U.S. is showing 129% debt to GDP. Of course we have the world reserve currency here but the UK is actually the second lowest debt to GDP in the entire G7. So as far as rich nations fare, it's doing quite well. Plus its duration is much further out. It's not just about how much you owe but how long do you have to pay. But nonetheless, it's still important to pay attention. Nor Ali joins us from Bloomberg, Markets Live. Should we be freaked out about this or is Jeremy Hunt going to do okay today? Morning Matt. Well look, you're absolutely right. If you look at credit, the credit risk age for the UK, which is the five year CDS, you'll see that it's come down from the highs. You're seeing that Markets are comparably a lot less panicked or they're much calmer coming into this budget session compared to the recent episode that we've seen in recent months. So from what I'm seeing, there's a lot more come. But the prospects for the UK economy in the short term and into the next year, now that is concerning. Yeah, that's interesting. The prospects for the economy. And no, in terms of what we look for today, I've had mixed views when I asked people how much the profiling matters. How much it matters.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,173,2022-11-17 10:20:38
17560," It's concerning. Yeah, that's interesting. The prospects for the economy. And no, in terms of what we look for today, I've had mixed views when I asked people how much the profiling matters. How much it matters if the pain is front loaded or back loaded. And some people say the market's attention is really on this. And other people say, no, I don't think it's going to matter too much. I think the UK is gaining back the market's trust and it'll be all right. What's your perspective of what matters today? My perspective is on the ground, Anna. It's incredibly important to strike that balance today for Hunt. He's going to talk about a storm that the UK is headed into today. You're seeing the constant living crisis come in with the energy crisis, which appears a lot less of a crisis at the moment for this winter. But what about next winter? And also, you have that economic slowdown in those fears. The BOE, steadfast on raising rates right now, industrial output coming down lower. It's a really bad picture right now in the UK. Well, on the subject of the BOE nor in theory, if you have more tightening on the fiscal side, that means monetary policy has to do less. No. So what are the BOE pricing implications here? Well, the BOE appears to be set on the plan that it has put out some time ago. They are the first developed central bank to actively sell their holdings. That's QT starting out. They are raising rates and perhaps not as aggressively as we've seen from the Fed. And inflation has not been reacting in the way that it had reacted in the US. It came in at 11.1% yesterday. It's again, a fresh record of 40-year higher or so. And it would have come in at 13.8% had it not been for the support that we've seen on the energy front. So we've had, for instance, a hue pill and counterman come and discuss the forward view. They're saying perhaps some pivot or some easing towards next year or the year after. But to be honest right now, if you're looking at the market, you're looking at the pound approaching 120. It has come off that right now because the dollar is stronger. But I'm not seeing a lot of positives there for the pound. OK. No, thanks very much. No, El Ali, of the Bloomberg Market's live team.

And we have time and time again, say be careful of the flowers you see out of the window. They have thorns on them. Welcome to the world of decentralized finance. I'm going to take a look right here at regulation. We are seeing digital currencies under some pressure. Bloomberg's covering all things crypto, the people. I want to have some of my money outside of the solder. The transactions. It all comes down to the details here. And the technology. How does that affect disruptors like you? What happens to everything that you're investing in when the last Bitcoin is mined? Bloomberg's early edition. I'm Kayley Lines with Matt Miller in New York and Ann Edwards in London. Now kicking you up to date with news from around the world. Here's the first word. In Europe, auto sales rose in October for the third month in a row. Still, there's concern that deteriorating economic conditions are starting to put off buyers. New car registrations climbed 14% last month. Europe's energy crisis is driving up costs and standing in the way of a more substantial recovery. The former chairman of Twitter says Elon Musk could be creating room for competitors. Patrick Pichette says that that could happen if Musk breaks the ethos of the company. He told Radio Canada it's too early to tell if Musk will be good for Twitter. In the Senate, legislation protecting the right of same-sex couples to marry advanced with Republican support. That sets it up for passage by a simple majority vote as soon as this week. Democrats say the bill is necessary because of the chance a conservative Supreme Court could overturn the ruling that legalized same-sex marriages. And there was a surprising public confrontation at the G20 summit in Indonesia. China's President Xi Jinping accused Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of leaking details of a private meeting between the two. She trod Trudeau, the leak was inappropriate. Trudeau responded that Canadians believe in free, open, and frank dialogue. So as we continue to monitor geopolitics, we're also focused on domestic politics and the fiscal equation in the UK with the autumn statement due in just about an hour. We'll discuss with Chris Hare of HSBC. This is Bloomberg. The standard way for venture firms to work is you commit capital over a five-year investment period, something like that. Yeah, exactly. And then the fund, typically, has maybe ten years or so. So often fifteen, often the tale extends out to twenty years. And somebody that invests in a venture fund today.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,175,2022-11-17 10:29:29
17562," Typically, they ask maybe 10 years or so. These days longer, so often 15, often the tail extends out to 20 years. These companies take a long time to develop. And somebody that invests in adventure fund today, should be trying to get rates of return of 20% would you say or more? Top and venture are sort of three X-net of fees. You know, ideally you're hoping for more than that. You're hoping for five X or more. You're illiquid the entire time, right? So you hope to get paid for their liquidity. And today? Today, maybe 20 to 40% if things go well is sort of baseline. Let's take another subject. That's supposed somebody says, I don't want to invest in injuries and horrible. I want to be Mark Andreessen. How does somebody become a venture capitalist? What are the skill sets for good venture capitalists? Is it a high degree of intelligence, hard work, lot of luck, dress the right part, don't wear a tie. What are the things that make one a good venture capitalist? So the super, the highly successful VCs historically are very idiosyncratic. You know, people from very different backgrounds, Mike Morris is a former newspaper reporter, John Doris of former chip salesman. You've got people with very different midgenbrier has more of this kind of blue chip investment background. You have people with very different backgrounds and experiences. And so I think it's, it's some set of skills and some set of knowledge. And then there seems to be a taste component to it that's really hard to measure and really hard to predict. This is Bluebacks of Aelons Early Edition. Here's what you need to know. Budget Day in the UK, Jeremy Hunt will try to reassure markets he can stabilize public finances without devastating cuts in government services. The crypto crisis spreads the fallout from the collapse of FTX has now ensnared the billionaire Winklevoss twins. And a power shift on Capitol Hill Republicans narrowly regain control of the House, giving them the ability to block President Biden's agenda. I'm Anna Edwards in London with Matt Miller and Kayleigh Lyons in New York. Matt, European equity markets a little bit weaker in the early part of the trading session, waiting for the set piece event that is the autumn statement here in the UK, basically a budget and looking at US futures. It seems everyone's gone off to make a cup of tea, get a coffee before the budget starts because there's not really much happening there. Yeah, I mean, what a better way to spend a Thursday morning than a nice warm cup of builders tea. What is it called? Builders tea, PG-Tibs, and listen to Jeremy Hunt, give his autumn statement. Look at the leaves changing color. And watch, well, S&P futures recover a little bit. We're not really much changed as you can see here. Down about 6100s of 1%. We did end the cash trade lower yesterday at 39.52, so moving incrementally further away from that 4,000 level that we eclipsed and then fell back below. The reason is we have headwinds in terms of dollar strength and 10-year yields. Both are increasing right now. You can see the Bloomberg US dollar index at 12.78 and the 10-year yield at 373.79 right now. Concern about Fed speakers who've come out and said, don't count on a pause, quit betting on a pivot. It's not going to happen. So as a result, the markets are less ebullient. Bitcoin right now down, also very little, 5100s of 1%. 16,522s, so hovering on the same levels that we've seen all week long. Kayleigh, do you see any pre-market movers? I do see some, and they're all related to earnings, because we still are getting those trickling out, even though the season is pretty much almost entirely over. Cisco being one that reported after the belly yesterday at beat in the quarter. They reported, also gave a bullish forecast. Still seeing that technology spending in the corporate sector. So as a result, that's stuck up about 4%. Well, Nvidia is up 2.4%. After also beating expectations, it's the AI and data center chip business that's helping offset some weakness elsewhere. And grab the Southeast Asian ride hailing company had a narrower loss than expected. Cost cuts seem to finally be kicking in. So that's stuck up about 2.5%. Finally, Macy's. This one is reporting in just a couple hours before the opening bell here in the US this morning. Of course, we've gotten a mixed bag for the retailers. We've seen so far this week, but Macy's.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,176,2022-11-17 10:33:43
17563, finally Macy's this one is reporting in just a couple hours before the opening bell here in the US this morning. Of course we've gotten a mixed bag for the retailers. We've seen so far this week but Macy's is going to be the first real tell on the apparel sector in particular ahead of its results. Interestingly Anna that's talk up about two and a half percent before the bell. Yeah a lot of focus on US retailers this week then. Kaley let's have a look at where we are in Europe. Matt was saying not very abulliant in the future picture for the US. Well that's certainly the case here in Europe European stocks down by two tenths of one percent mining stocks taking the brunt of that in London weighing on London. Ziemann helps Germany to outperform and though the engineering giants up by seven percent they reported numbers and it seems to this the factory automation side of the business that is structurally doing pretty well right now at least according to analysts. Here we have the euro and the pound and both of those are losing a little bit of ground against the US dollar. Maybe that's slight tick up in the US dollar once again is something that takes the edge off risk assets and certainly peak dollar conversations we've had plenty of those over recent weeks. Interesting to see how far the pound has recovered though since that mini budget so called mini budget which had anything but a mini effect on the markets we went down to 103 which is more whether euro is currently trading incidentally but one eighteen is where we jump back up to but we are now waiting for Jeremy Hunt the Chancellor to speak and he will do that in we understand in the next hour or so we should hear from the chancellor. Right now we have Prime Minister Rishi Sunag speaking in the House of Commons or at least he is getting ready to he's going to be delivering some remarks there he is on his return from the G20 in barley giving his thoughts he of course had a meeting with President Biden and he was quite outspoken in his criticism of China thank you. Yep but and of course really what we're watching for in the House of Commons is an hour from now as you said when we received the autumn statement from Jeremy Hunt that has major implications for the trajectory of growth and inflation in the UK economy joining us now to discuss it is Chris Hare he is HSBC's senior economist Chris obviously this is a very hard line to walk where you don't want to do too much restrictive in order to take growth but also they need to get spending under control what is your expectation of what the balance struck will be today. Yes it's really tough task for Chancellor Jeremy Hunt I think we're looking out for a couple of things the first is the size of this so-called fiscal black hole that a lot of people have been banding around figures up to around 50 60 billion pounds or so and of course then House of Fillet what kind of mix we're going to see in terms of tax rises and spending cuts but I think most interesting for me is the timing by which this fiscal belt tightening will happen so from our perspective we think that there's at least a chunk of backloading that's going to happen in terms of this belt tightening i.e. certain tax rises and spending cuts that we extended out to 2025 or 2026 or so such that the pain in terms of the macroeconomic headwinds will at least be smoothed out somewhat but again that raises a credibility question if you're backloading your fiscal tightening by so much then there are questions about well will it actually happen eventually. Yes especially good morning to you Chris especially as 2025 takes us into a new parliament that's after the next election I mean things as they stand right now that would be everybody's assumption so in terms of the Bank of England's calculations I suppose things that are promised in 2025 might not have much impact and in terms of the markets thinking do those promises about 2025 have much impact. Well I think at least to some extent because perceptions about fiscal credibility is not just necessarily about concrete action of course concrete action is important and we saw that with the unwinding of trust dynamics which allowed markets to settle but while we want to see some concrete action over the next two to three years or so it's also about sort of vibes and direction of travel and if the direction of travel is in the right sort of direction from a markets perspective and it's one that talks about meeting fiscal targets even though it's some way off well at least markets can think well the direction of travel is sort of okay and when we come to the other side of a general election it might be quite hard for a future government to really row back on that in a major way so it has some impacts but we're certainly not looking like massive market panics as a result of this we don't think. Okay yes well let's everyone keeps their fingers crossed I suppose unless you're betting on that kind of thing let me ask you about a fiscal drag because that seems to be something we're really watching for today there have been lots of promises in the 2019 manifesto by this government under previous leadership of course that they wouldn't put up various taxes so that limits the range of movement they can't put up tax rates but they can allow more and more people to be caught by taxes yes,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,177,2022-11-17 10:38:03
17564," Of course, they wouldn't put up various taxes. So that limits the range of movement. They can't put up tax rates, but they can allow more and more people to be caught by taxes. Yes, that's right. So by freezing income tax thresholds, the Think Tank Institute for Physical Studies said that that could raise up to around £30 billion per year by 2026. So potentially it could be a pretty big revenue razor or a very big revenue razor. But there are a couple of caveats associated with that. First, that's 2026, that's the other side of the next general election. And second, there's a question about notwithstanding an election, it's still politically difficult to see such big rises in effective tax rates for so many people. So we are looking for other things in terms of potential consolidation that could come in the form of spending cuts, which could be pretty hefty as we see the announcement in an hour's time. How bad is the UK going to fare in terms of the upcoming recession compared to say continental European countries or the US? Well, it's pretty tough times ahead for the UK. Unlike in the US, of course, Europe, including the UK, is facing high inflation driven by an energy crisis and those rising utility bills. So in terms of our UK expectations, well, the UK we think is already in recession. We saw a contraction in GDP in the third quarter. That was weaker than in the Eurozone. And we've got contractions over the next couple of quarters, such that there are potentially some bigger UK-specific issues than the Eurozone because we've got the energy crisis, the prospect of fiscal consolidation. Very high inflation with food prices rising by over 16% year on year as we saw in yesterday's data, issues with regards labor supply, potentially some Brexit issues underlying all of that. So there really is a big list of UK economic headwinds. Some of those UK-specific are not just global. But just Brexit really makes things worse. And is there any possibility of reversing some of those, some of that damage? Well, with Brexit, it's really difficult. Politically, it doesn't look like there's going to be any major reversal in terms of the Brexit settlement anytime soon. Now, for economists, the job has been really difficult to try to umpick what kind of impact Brexit has actually had on the UK economy, relative to COVID effects, for example. There was a lot of discussion of this among NPC members with a Treasury select committee. Yesterday, and it does seem to be that there is certainly some sort of role with regards Brexit on the UK trade story, possibly some kind of effect on the inflation story, which is particularly pertinent at the moment when we're thinking about the cost of living squeeze. So there is something there and potentially some headwinds which could keep blowing for some time to come. Chris, as we also think about kind of external factors that authorities in the UK and really economic authorities around the world have to think about, I wonder how you're thinking about China. We heard from the PBOC overnight, warning about inflation saying that a recovery and demand in the Chinese economy could fuel that. And in theory, that could be exported elsewhere. How are you thinking about the China reopening story and how that could exacerbate some of these price pressures that economies like the UK are facing? Yes, for UK and Europe, the impact of China on the economy is a kind of multifaceted sort of thing. Of course, for a lot of European exporters, this is a good news story. If there's a sharp reopening in China, that could help broader domestic spending in China. But that might also have some spillover effects in terms of the exports that Europe sends to China. But then at the same time, stronger growth in China has put upward pressure on commodity prices. That might be an inflationary impact. I mean, overall, when we're thinking about the UK in particular, those exposures to China aren't necessarily a first-order issue. But I think overall, if we're thinking about stronger growth in China, a rising tide lifting the global economy, it should overall be a good thing, notwithstanding the fact that it might create some inflationary pressures along the way. Chris, thanks very much. Thanks for joining us, Chris, here of HSBC. And stay with us. We'll bring you coverage of Jeremy Hunt's statement, of course. The UK Chancellor will be speaking to the House of Commons. It's usually a round-eifer. Plenty to watch for in terms of that, UK, autumn statement. What will it do to UK assets?

This is Bloomberg's surveillance early edition. I'm Anna Edwards in London with Matt Miller and Kayleigh Lines in New York. Let's keep our focus on the UK. The Chancellor Jeremy Hunt delivers his statement in the House of Commons today within the hour. Joining us now to discuss markets, Bloomberg, opinion, and markets. You've been writing about the difficult choices that lie ahead. You say the government knows it can't risk a repeat of the recent meltdown in guilt. What does it need to make sure it does today to avoid that? Normally, I would be the type of person advocating austerity when I'm clearly in a recession and probably going deeper because of this statement. However, the premium that was built up on guilt assets is so ruinous that we saw a month or so ago. They have been allowed by the markets a face that they are going to correct that and fill up the fiscal black hole and do something sensible with the guards to get the balanced budget in at least five years' time. They have to deliver on that. That means they have to do some nasty things now. They can't push it all out beyond 2025. You're discussing before. Passing the next election, no one will be spending cuts out then. Likewise, credibility has to be kept by the markets. They're not going to see some future measures, which possibly never going to happen. They have to do some nasty things now. There is some benefit from that because if the OBR recognizes it, that fees directly into the bank of England's models and hopefully the bank of England doesn't have to buy interest so much. OK, so that's the link between the fiscal and the monetary and the way that they might support each other here, then, markets. Thinking about where this heads next, you've set out why the profiling then matters to you and you think to the markets. What about the level of political support that this budget can achieve? Is there's no point in presenting something that's not going to get through the house? How will the market be thinking about that? Yeah, so the cunning balance between doing enough now to get some benefit from the OBR, to then get benefit from the bank doing it and then we're completely trapped in this sort of convetritions black box, falls apart when it hits the reality of getting it through to the house of commons. Now one imagines that they have got this through in a sense that they've done enough works with the weps to make sure that people will vote.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,179,2022-11-17 10:46:41
17566," the reality of getting it through the house of commons. Now one imagines that they have got this through in the sense that they've done enough works with the whips to make sure that people will vote. We saw one MP question whether HS2 should go ahead and possibly withhold per support for it. But beyond that, this is going to be a very difficult financial build to get through. And I think there are going to be some troubles here. Nonetheless, what we want looking for is white. If they do a bit harder now, how much room that might give them before the next election led 24 to have done some easing back of this? And that again, all depends on these OBR forecast. They're all sort of linking in a horrible loop. If he gets it right, he'll be lucky. If he gets it even a little bit wrong, it all falls apart, especially if you get a worse recession. How badly could it fall apart? I mean, I realize you've got sky high inflation and Rishi Suneak doesn't even want to give nurses a range of options. It's a raise, but the pound has come back to 119. Now your debt to GDP is very low compared to other rich countries. The duration is double of your debt is double what it is here in the US. You got much longer to pay it off. Doesn't seem that bad, Marcus. Yeah, until you get the fact that Killy's heel are basically of what happened the month or so ago, when everything fell apart, really very quickly indeed. And I think a lot of the rest of the world were looking at a gate about one habit is possibly happening in a major economy like the UK. Two could this happen to us. And so the point is they've got to play very, very straight, very sensibly. No rabbits out of hats because we have to keep that guilt yield down to level. Otherwise, the cost of funding is what is going to kill the back end in 2026, 27. The cost of funding is going to add an extra potential 50 billion. They've got to get that down, keep that down, which means the back of England. Hopefully where I can just rate as much. So it's a very painful exercise. Things can go very badly. We've seen that. I think the real risk here is that one they may not get, you know, the Tory party falls apart again or secondly, because of that of recession, if they overdo it. So I don't know how they're going to balance this, but these are some very clever people. We saw what really connected with furlough scheme. I'm hoping against logic that they find something we haven't all thought of yet. And somehow that the things could all add up, but not sure I've got that much confidence. Well, Marcus, as we talk about kind of a spectrum of outcomes here, what about the spectrum of inflation? How much could it change in trajectory, depending on the policy that Jeremy Hunt outlines today? Well, I mean, if we hadn't had the loose trust sort of blanket energy cap, we would be looking at close to 14% inflation, which we'd rather than 11.1. So I think it's a very bold call. We've probably seen the top of inflation in the UK. And that is it might be sort of hanging around here for next two or three months, maybe longer. Well, inflation is set to climate later next year and possibly by the two years time to be one below the back of England target and even close to zero. So, you know, the bank of England doesn't need to do too much more that they've got to be convinced. I'll have a percent inflation that the government's got the government finances in control. So they can have a confidence to look through some stuff and maybe not hike quite so much. Okay. Thank you very much, Marcus. Very good to speak to you. Linking the fiscal in the monetary. Remember opinions, Marcus Ashworth. Thank you very much for joining us. Just want to take you through a few lines we're getting from British. You soon act after the G20 and Bali talking to the House of Commerce ahead of the physical statement today, saying that China poses a significant challenge to our values. Also talking about trade deals, saying that he won't sacrifice quality for speed on trade deals. Perhaps that's in a reflection of some within his party. You've criticized his predecessor Liz Truss for perhaps setting deadlines around trade deals which didn't necessarily work in the UK's favour. That's the UK prime minister more from the Chancellor shortly. This is Blinde. Thank you very much.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,180,2022-11-17 10:50:58
17567," Great question. Great question. And past question I get all night. Remember, top experts, great questions. We would really want to hear that the perpetrator country is a Russian Federation. We would be happy if the state could be named Speed. China and the United States as two major countries both stand to gain from cooperation and lose from confrontation. As we look at supply chains around the world, they were fit for 20 to 30 years ago. The central banks misread the signs, they misread the risk of persistent and much higher in the nation. My team for choice, things 2023, we avoid a recession. I'm a little more skeptical. We're going to have new and improved data access protocols such that only an entity of US residents in the US will have access to a sudden set of US protected data. We work the industry has been cut to ribbons this year. It's just too risky. They set out with a bunch of cowboys who have managed to blow themselves up. That's just a few of the highlights from the Bloomberg and new economy forum that took place in Singapore this week. Now let's get a quick check on what is coming up ahead on this Thursday. Alibaba will be reporting its earnings results at 6.30 a.m. New York time plus retail earnings continue with Macy's reporting before the bell. On the economic data front we'll get some here in the US including housing starts and building permits and finally we'll hear from more Fed's papers including St. Louis Fed President Jim Bullard and Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester. But as we all have our eyes on monetary policy we also are watching fiscal especially in the UK as we await the out of statement from Jeremy Hunt in the next hour. Let's get over to our markets reporter Valerie Taitel who has taken a look at the implications for the guilt market. Valerie? Yes, thanks Kayleigh. A key thing for the guilt market today will be the update from the debt management office on the guilt remit which is the issuance they expect for this year and next. Now interestingly the survey estimate from Bloomberg that we conducted only showed a 5% decrease in the issuance that versus in September. Now remember these September numbers were shocking for the market. It was near 200 billion of expected guilt issuance this fiscal year and so the market has only really taken that down by 5% we're still expecting a lot of issuance this year and next. And cities specifically the strategist at city actually expect the number to be elevated over the next 2, 3, 4 years. Now one might say well given these estimates are still high for guilt issuance why have guilt yields retrace so much but you know this is coming at a time where there's been two key things that have changed. The UK their terms of trade have rebounded sharply so that massive hole in the current account deficit we were worried about were no longer too concerned. And also the US inflation data looks like it's cooling that's allowed the dollar to soften treasure yields to lower so it's a much better time to be confronting the market with this issuance. But if what city says for example is correct that it's not just this year of issuance but the next 2, 3, 4 you know the UK government still has to tread quite carefully when they approach the market with these issuance numbers. Thank you very much BlueBase Valerie Titell there and Kaylee interesting point then for Valerie in terms of the global backdrop in bond markets so what the UK is doing here trying to regain that lost credibility with debt markets with guilt markets and the backdrop globally is more conducive to doing that it seems although when you look at markets today we seem to be back to worrying about some of the things we were doing before we saw a rally in risk assets worrying about Fed tightening once again worrying how long it goes on for and where it gets to. It always seems to come back to that doesn't it Anna went at the end of the day we're trying to assign a narrative to the market action it's always like oh well the Fed and what those speakers are saying so we'll definitely have to watch for that today but we are seeing futures right now at such lows down about half a percent on S&P E-minis the 10 year yield right now Anna at 373. That is it for early edition that's it for Matt Milakady lines and for me here in London we will leave you with the surveillance team.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,181,2022-11-17 10:58:12
17568," That is it for early edition. That's it for Matt Milakady lines and for me here in London. We will leave you with the surveillance team. They will be bringing you coverage of course of the autumn statement here in the UK. Lots more to talk about on the markets as well. This is Blinkberg. What do you say to the cynics that say, look, it's all nice and fine, but a lot of it is greenwashing, and you're not a good company. You're just a less toxic company than some of the other oil majors. Well, the first thing to say is that I'm a big believer in we need to put ourselves in other persons' shoes in life in general. So I understand that point of view and I get that people have that perspective. I don't agree with that, obviously, but I understand where they're coming from. We have an enormous challenge as society, which is to provide the world with reliable, affordable, and clean energy. That's what society wants. That's what society needs. And I believe in my heart that a company like BP is actually one of the few companies in the world who can actually make that happen. We can talk about the things that we're going to grow in over the coming years. And I find it hugely exciting and energizing for our organization. But that's what the world needs. And you simply can't go against the grain of society. You can't defy gravity. And that's why we're making the change that we're making. Every Friday with 30 minutes dedicated to fixed income, I'm Jonathan Farrow. This is with Berg Riljot. This could be somewhat of a shallow recession, but more prolonged period of downturn. The market is going to continue to heal over the next year, but you're still going to have more volatile environment. The company is still plenty. Maybe it will happen. Maybe we have the disinflation forces. It has to go all the way to two for the Fed to be able to truly step off the brakes and allow for a neutral policy. We're all certainly trying to figure out when the point is correct for the Fed to slow down, when the tightening is going to slow down. This is Bloomberg surveillance with Tom Keane, Jonathan Farrow, and Lisa Abramowitz. Good morning, everyone. Jonathan Farrow, Lisa Brahminson, Tom Keane. Thank you for joining Bloomberg surveillance on radio on television. It's boring out there. It's Thursday claims. Yes, we'll get some housing data. Forget about it. Absolute history and the land of Brahmau with curve inversion. Our number one story today. Lisa, you nailed this yesterday on a tweet. We go back 40 years for the unusualness.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,182,2022-11-17 11:02:31
17569," in the land of Bramow with curve in version. Our number one story today, Lisa, you nailed this yesterday on a tweet. We go back 40 years for the unusualness of this moment. The significance of this is we're looking at a slowdown. How steep is the slowdown going to be? What are the contours of it? We'll be short and shallow. We'll be long and shallow. We'll be a deep and short. All of these questions of how much pain do we have to yet see? And then you have a lot of people trying to push back against that and saying, the earnings haven't been so bad. And when they haven't been so bad, you get sometimes a surprise rally. I got a question to you folks. This is the wheelhouse of the unknown Bramow years ago at Bloomberg News. This is really what she does. Absolute best. We're going to advance that conversation. Ira Jersey will join us later. Ian Lingen will join us from BMO Capital Market on what you need to know about 63 basis points of inversion. How does it filter out into investment grade credit, high yield credit in that? Does it filter out into your real world? If you take a step back, the reason why this matters. So much is that if people are getting paid more to go into short term debt, to basically lend for one year or two years, they're earning substantially more than going out and lending for 10 years, what does that say about the prospects longer term and where are people going to put their money? They're going to hide it. They're not necessarily going to have these big things. This is about, this is about cash under the mattress. I got to park my money out 20 years, which folks leads into the auction yesterday of the 20 year, which actually mattered. It's time now for Bloomberg surveillance auction talk. Let's go there literally explain the world's like me. Why the 20 year auction yesterday falls into Ian Lingen's shock of massive inversion. One consensus right now that we keep hearing from guests after guests by long duration. That is a new consensus. People who tried it before, they've gotten their faces ripped off. And here we are. We're doing it again. And people saying, regardless of what's happening, based on the Fed speak that we've been getting, they are convinced they're committed to torpedoing inflation whatever it takes, even if there is some sort of significant down. So on a quiet day, it's not quiet. And the land of fixed income, it's a huge, huge day with historic, curve and version, ira jersey again, looking for vulgar, like inversion possible. I'm going to put the word possible on that. It's also possible. The chance of the checker will move the market in London and will move sterling, pricing in on the Bloomberg and around it up 119 this morning. Guy Johnson says this is an important speech. Well, it's important because we've all been looking for what sort of fiscal austerity we're going to get from the United Kingdom in the face of inflation and 11.1% of the latest CPI read, right? How much do they have to cut back spending in order to appease really the guilt market and frankly the pound market, the effects market? How much do they have to respond to something that Liz Trust could not respond to? And then what is the response? If they just cause an even deeper recession, is that positive for the pound or is that negative for them? We're going to jump to this at 630 here, you're going to see it here on Bloomberg where the chancellor will announce. One of all the headlines of that and then Guy Johnson will translate for us from London. What I find fascinating here is its austerity, but we've never had austerity with a full employment that we have right now, at least the full employment we see in November. How quickly is it moving? And one of the big mysteries heading into 2023, how significant are the lag effects? How much are we going to feel the burn of whatever the Fed and Central Banks around the world are going to do? Get a gopennath, really excellent on this over at NEF and Singapore talking about how we don't have a sense of how much you're going to end up with all of these together moves from our central banks on the world, what the effects are going to be in hydromatic. Sure the hour will get through this John Williams of the New York Fed with some important comments yesterday along the line of Dr. Gopennath as well. The future is a negative 20, the data, I mean it's there, the curving version is a lead story, negative 64 basis points, 10 year yield, 3.73 at a 3.69 yesterday showing price up, yield down, going for that long term duration. Oil doesn't give me a story, $92 on Brent and foreign exchange with one big model, one big churnier, a sterling as we go to Jeremy Hunt, it's 630, 118, 56. I need a brief because I'm focused on claims and housing, what else is going on? It's the reality television show that is Fed's beak. I mean honestly, every day, it's live blogging, the Federal Reserve, it is the reality TV, Federal Reserve officials, they're just like us, but honestly every single day, the rhetoric, the drum,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,183,2022-11-17 11:06:53
17570," That is Fed speak. I mean, honestly every day it's live blogging the Federal Reserve. It is the reality TV Federal Reserve officials. They're just like us. But honestly, every single day the rhetoric, the drum beat coming out today. It includes St. Louis, Fed President James Bullard, Fed Governor Michelle Bowman, Cleveland Fed President, Loretta Master, Fed Governor Philip Jefferson, and Minneapolis Fed President Neil Kashkari. And tonight, if it wasn't enough, Charlie Evans is having a retirement party from the Chicago Fed. No, we remarks from J. Powell, John Williams, and Mary Lee. From the chairman. Well, it's not going to be anything that's substantial in terms of monetary policy. We appreciate you, Charlie. Thank you for being with us, et cetera, et cetera, on your exit of the Chicago Fed. It's interesting. This has actually been moving markets more than anything else. What's your, what's your skepticism? Bring it up again here folks. And on radio, we're bringing up all the faces of the Speaker-Thon today at the Fed. John Williams, yesterday not linking financial stability into monetary exercise. The PhD from Indiana, newly-mended Michelle Bowman, Loretta Master, an arch-mathematician from Cleveland, Philip Jefferson with terrific social economic credibility as a Fed governor in the aerospace engineer from Minneapolis. I mean, everybody's got a different background. Everybody's got a different story. And we're all listening because that has been moving the markets probably more than anything recently. Economic data out today at 8.30 a.m. including October housing starts, building permits, as well as initial jobless claims. And then at 10 a.m. we get October home sales. I'm watching the home data. Yes. Because the housing market to me is one of the biggest financial risks I keep reading about. We'll dig into it more coming up. But I also want to mention we're getting retail earnings. May sees it 655 estimated this morning. Coals at seven, raw stores at 4 p.m. Gap at 415. How much are we looking at a bifurcated of the halves and the have-nots? A bifurcated picture among the retailers. And how much are we getting a sense? This holiday season might not be so great. Wasn't Dana Tulsi fun yesterday? She was great. We should get her back. Really, really capturing the moment. I want to do this right now with the brief as quick as I can. And I'll re-mention this every hour. The best tweet yesterday. Jason Furman teaching act 10 up at Harvard. And he says there's two core inflations out there. Lisa, there's a core inflation of 5.8 percent based on existing leases. And the new spot market lease core inflation is a stunningly low 2.8 percent. Yeah. How quickly can you get rid of that? Retweeted by the laureate crewman. So that's really important for housing. Let's get to it right now. And foreign exchange, Facilius Gianakis joins us. Head of European FX strategy at City Group. We have austerity and an austerity speech in the United Kingdom, Facilius. Tell me about the new austerity you see and what that will do to the dollar. Well, as far as the UK is concerned, I think potentially we've swung the pendulum from one side. Where we had points, many budgets that was judged to be to a large extent. Irresponsibly, I've imprated that. Carrying sick crisis, confidence of crisis as I called it. But right now, obviously to appease markets and to restore part of the lost credibility, potentially we're moving towards the other end. I think what is important, the number of points that are actually important in the sorry in the budget announcement that we're going to get. First of all, we'll go deep enough, we'll go far enough in terms of the actual austerity measures. And everything that we're reading and all the headlines that we're seeing suggest that it will. And in that respect, it will actually be a fiscal package that will aim to a certain extent to basically fight inflation. So in a sense, you're going to have monetary policy and fiscal policy moving together, which brings me to the second point that this alleviates part of the pressure from the Bank of England to be very aggressive on interest rate heights. And I've been saying this for quite some time, I don't think that the Bank of England has the willingness to go really hard on interest rates because it's very, very much aware of the depending sharp correction in the housing market. That has been the case. In all previous downturns in the UK, the UK mortgage market is very, just in credit in its nature. It has a very, very short fixed rate mortgage offering, which means that at every point in time we get more individuals that need to refinance of the debt prevailing.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,184,2022-11-17 11:11:10
17571," very, very short fixed rate mortgage offering, which means that at every point in time we get more individuals that need to refinance of the debt prevailing higher rates. I think bottom line, the message sterling is going to get, which I think has been leaving some sort of a two euphoric environment, is that we're heading towards a deeper and longer recession. The BOD is going to reprise slower, and ultimately all of that is going to be bad. So sterling. That should be bad for sterling, which really raises this question, because as you were speaking, I wasn't sure where you were going in terms of this, this is good for sterling or bad for sterling. If you end up curbing inflation, at what point does austerity kill the momentum of a currency? And at what point does it support, because it's actually helping kill off the inflation that so many people have been worried about? Well, listen, I think these things work in cycles. As I said before, I think the austerity is likely to restore part of credibility. But equally at the same time, there will be a long and deep recession sterling sterling in the face. So the recovering the UK is probably potentially going to let the recovery in other countries, which means that you're going to have a resuffling of portfolio allocations. So at the initial stage of the austerity, it will be a bad thing for the currency. As the austerity progresses, and of course, you start seeing some of the benefits of that mean a lower debt to GDP ratio, then that potentially starts providing setting a stage up for a recovery in the currency. But again, I'll go, I'll mention this one more time. Right. Aside all these things, the UK is facing a structural program, which is deeply rooted in the process. We're going to have to leave it there because of time, and we've got to get the 630 in the chancellor as well. Facility of Geonachus of City Group, thank you so much for a brief there, particularly on pound sterling this morning. It will be on a steer speech here in about 15 minutes, and then Guy Johnson will follow with analysis.

17572," Pull out an elusion? Gen Z can't seem to get enough of Prada. Loafers, nylon bags and its Miumu micro-minus gun have been flying off the shelves into and onto the arms of young consumers. Fashion tech company list plays Prada's second on its fashion index that is highest ever ranking. So what could be making this over a century year old fashion house appealing to a new generation of consumers? Prada has not been adeptly is their overall understanding of how cultural conversations are happening online. Their ability to partner with various cultural figures. Gen Z faces are at the front of Prada's advertising to this new market. Maya Hawk, Hunter Shaffer and Sydney Swini will be familiar to any fans of Stranger Things or Euphoria. There could be another factor at play, the environment. Of those surveyed by the Lancet, over 59% of Gen Z said that they were extremely worried about the climate crisis. So for example, the revival of Prada's iconic nylon handbag using eco-friendly materials may be winning kudos among these shoppers. Of course, Prada Miumu are not inexpensive brands and as the global cost of living crisis hits, these brands might start to feel a pinch. But for now, Gen Z seem to be reaching for their nylon handbags and not letting go. No one covers the world like Bloomberg. My team thinks 2023, we avoid a recession.

The markets can live with us because any progressive legislation that makes it out of the Senate and goes to the House will die in the House. Great Bill Yeh of AGF, really brilliant yesterday on this election that continues. There's no question about that, and his note this morning speaks about Speaker Pelosi and perhaps we will see news on our future today. We're going to get a brief on that and tie it in to international relations with Ann Marie Harden at the G20 meetings, wrapping that event up. Our Bloomberg Washington correspondent in Indonesia. Ann Marie, I want to link this together in that our Editor-in-Chief John McElthrey in conversation with Mr. Zelensky of Ukraine, which comes right over to the first order of business for a Republican House. Do we actually believe the United States will hold back aid to a nation at war? Well, it's a big question given the fact that yesterday we had the news at the Republicans, even though it's a slim majority, it's still a majority. They have the control of the House now and set to be Speaker, most likely, if you can get those 218-4 million January, Kevin McCarthy has said that it will not be a blank check no longer for Ukraine. We should know he has also backtracked saying that he just wants a little bit more scrutiny, but he is going to have to really deal with a divided party. And individuals like Marjorie Taylor Green, the representative from Georgia, saying no more money should go to Ukraine. So that's one of the issues, but we should also know when John McElthrey, Editor-in-Chief, sat down with President Zelensky, he's talking about the fact that no one could be 100 percent short. This is a Ukrainian defense rocket that ended up in Poland. He wants to send Ukrainian officials to Poland, and the president, when he got off Marie Wan, and before he went into the White House, was asked about these claims from Zelensky, he said that the evidence doesn't show that. Interesting. And we need to talk about the event of today, perhaps, or maybe on the Christmas of the retirement of Speaker Pelosi. The gentleman, the Congressman from Coney Island, Congressman Jeffries, is touted by some, is taking over as a new speaker, excuse me, the new minority leader for the Democrats. Explain for our international audience the symbolism of a Pelosi retirement and a generational shift for Democrats. Well, this would be huge news, and we have to use the word B-Tom, because we don't know yet what Speaker Pelosi is going to be announcing this afternoon in Washington, D.C. We just know from her office that she is set to make an announcement, and it is widely anticipated that she is going to say she will not run for the leadership anymore. And that would pass on to a new generation, as you mentioned. This is something that she has discussed with Democrats, and there was even this handshake deal that that would happen. But you never know, of course, because Speaker Pelosi has been a tactician when it comes to the legislative process, when it comes to making sure she is getting the vote out, and the Democrats did very well. All things considered, everyone saying it was going to be a red wave, and also the dollars that she brings in for the party. She was also the first female speaker of the House. She has decades of legislative work under her belt. So it would be a very huge shift for the Democrats in the House, but we should wait to hear what she has to say first. Quickly she should note, though. She did say recently that what happened to her husband in the end of October when he was attacked in his own home, she said that would play into her decision. So maybe she does want to take a moment back and spend some more time with her family at this moment. And remember about eight minutes away from a state van over the United Kingdom, expected to be austerity, expected to be cuts across the board with the a terminal statement from Rishi Sunak. In the United States, as we do have the Republicans claiming the majority, albeit a slim majority in the House, how much are we looking at something not quite similar in the U.S., but perhaps a little bit more of a shift to austerity and a lack of spending.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,187,2022-11-17 11:24:10
17574," austerity and a lack of spending. Well, you can see the Republicans are want to put the absolute breaks on any of those agenda items. President Biden wanted to get through. You think of closing corporate loophole taxes. You think of raising corporate taxes or raising taxes on the very wealthy in America. That is something the Republicans are not going to vote on, board for. But more immediately, what markets are going through the most focused on is, of course, the debt ceiling drama. We deal with this every so often. But the Republicans have said in the campaigning towards the midterm elections that they would potentially use the debt ceiling as hostage to enact spending cuts from the Democrats. So in the immediate future, this is something the markets need to focus on. What kind of deal can the Republicans the Democrats do to make sure we're not at that so-called fiscal cliff? How much are the really, is President Biden coming back from the G20 in an even stronger position versus a somewhat muddied one, especially when it comes to China? And what he'd like to see Congress do in terms of setting certain parameters for businesses in the U.S.? Well, it's going to be interesting, as you mentioned, China. Because also we do have Xi Jinping continuing on this tour, as he's left, even though he hasn't really traveled outside of China, of course, since the COVID-19 pandemic. And he had some interesting choice words about making sure that there's not this power-balanced dynamic fight within the Asia Pacific, as he's in Bangkok, with the Vice President of Kamala Harris will also be there for the APAC. And what I think of China right now in the United States, what you see is that there's bipartisan support. But there's one issue that we have seen Democrats have taken issue with the White House. And that's the Taiwan Policy Act. This is something that has potentially a lot of momentum, potentially the next speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy. When Speaker Pelosi went to Taiwan, he said he'd like himself to lead a delegation. And that would obviously erke Beijing. And that would be an interesting timing, because they're coming off the heels of this summit. And meeting they had in Bali, which everyone said, was a path to potential warmer relationships, at least more of a dialogue. Potentially that would cause a little bit more fiery rhetoric. And Marie Horton, thank you so much. And Bali wrapping up the G20 meetings today.

17577," i ardect. British families make sacrifices every day to live within their means and so too must their government, because the United Kingdom will always pay its way. I understand the motivation of my predecessors, Mini-budget, and he was correct. He was correct to identify growth as a priority, but unfunded tax cuts are as risky as unfunded spending, which is why we reversed the plan measure. As a result, government borrowing has fallen, the pound has strengthened, and the OBR says today that the lower interest rates generated by the government's actions are already benefiting our economy and public finances. That, Mr Speaker, credibility cannot be taken for granted. Yesterday's inflation figures show that we must continue a relentless fight to bring it down, including a rock-solid commitment to rebuild our public finances. Richard Hughes and his team at the OBR today lay out starkly the impact of global headwinds on the UK economy, and I am enormously grateful to him and his team for their thorough work. The OBR forecast the UK's inflation rate to be 9.1% this year and 7.4% next year. They confirm that our actions today help inflation to fall sharply from the middle of next year. They also judge that the UK, like other countries, is now in recession. Overall, this year, the economy is still forecast to grow by 4.2%. GDP then falls in 2023 by 1.4% before rising by 1.3%, 2.6%, and 2.7% in the following three years. The OBR says higher energy prices explain the majority of the downward revision in cumulative growth since March. They also expect a rise in unemployment from 3.6% today to 4.9% in 2024, the fall falling to 4.1%. Today's decisions mean that over the next five years, Jeremy Hunt, the Chancellor of the Exchequer were the forecast widely anticipated and very much different from the Bank of England. Of course, the Governor of the Bank of England making headlines a number of days ago with a two-year recession. I did not hear that there in the optimism of the Chancellor of the Exchequer. We welcome all of you on radio and television worldwide across America on a Thursday morning claims here in two hours. But the claim that I hear there, Lisa, before we go to Guy Johnson, is this was a statement of international ramifications towards a situation the United Kingdom is? Could he just have said it's America's fault? I mean, that's what everybody's been saying. America's saying it's not just us. It's everybody, and we're actually managing it better than everybody else. 11.1% is idiosyncratic to also the United Kingdom and to Europe based on the energy crisis, but it is being felt around the world and the austerity and the emphasis I'm bringing down inflation really important. Two statistics that I really want to frame this for the American audience that are so different. And again, the headline here is the the 2023 guesstimate of their economy. 1.8% becomes a positive 1.4%. A gallon of petrol, as Mr. Farrow would said or Guy Johnson would say, a gallon of petrol is different within the United Kingdom. It is a stunning $7.30 per gallon versus $3.70 that we see in the United States. And the other we can't forget in Guy Johnson knows this is the size of their economy. It is absolutely stunning how much smaller it is than the United Kingdom. Guy Johnson joins us now in London. Guy it's a more optimistic construction than we heard from the Bank of England and Governor Bailey. Who's correct on the view forward on economic growth? Tom, when when the Governor of the Bank of England talks about that two year recession, he was saying if current market pricing on where rates go is realized, we will have that length of a recession. However, we don't anticipate that rates will get that high. Therefore, by extension, we don't...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,191,2022-11-17 11:41:31
17578," go is realized we will have that length of a recession. However, we don't anticipate that rates will get that high therefore by extension we don't think the the downturn will be as severe as maybe that extreme forecast would suggest. So I don't think they're quite as unaligned as maybe they look at first blush in terms of what the headlines look like. Jeremy Hunts the OBR and we're going to get a briefing from the OBR around 2pm today are certainly suggesting that the UK is already in recession and it will retain in recession for really quite some time Tom. The issue now is how we manage inflation through that process how high rates are ultimately going to go and how severe the fiscal contraction is going to be. Tom what we are witnessing here is a massive U-turn. We are going from 45 billion of tax cuts to circa 20 billion of tax rises plus a significant fiscal event in terms of the contraction we're going to see in government spending. So a massive U-turn being experienced here in the UK. Guy this is so so important and I think it really becomes an international story as we heard from the chancellor of the ex-checker. Most people in England are not going to buy the idea this is international in any way. Why is he doing that? Why is he selling an international event affecting the United Kingdom? This is the politics Tom what he is effectively trying to do is shift the blame. This is not our fault this is something that all countries are experiencing at the moment. There is some element of truth in that clearly there are idiosyncratic factors that are affecting the UK. Brexit is the one that instantly springs to mind and clearly that is having an effect on the economy but there are international factors as well you were just talking about the cost of energy it is significantly higher here not just the petrol pump but in terms of the gas prices the energy prices electricity prices that we're all having to pay. So there is some element of truth there but there are idiosyncratic Brexit British related issues that are also affecting this economy. I'm looking right now and I was expecting given the fact that they expect the UK GDP forecast they expect the GDP to shrink just 1.4 percent next year from 1.8 percent of a gain before it seems like you would end up having an even bigger reaction in the pound than we were having. You're seeing it 1.18 not that far off where it was. How do you explain that? So let's think about where the pound has come from Lisa and I know a lot of people are scratching their heads over this at the moment but think about where we were and think about where we're coming from. I come back to this issue of this U-turn and markets as we all know the pendulum often swings too far and maybe that's what we're experiencing right now but we've gone from a massive 45 billion of unfunded tax cuts to tax rises and fiscal consolidation. So you're getting a massive swing here. You're going from a government of chance that was playing fast and lose some would argue with the British economy given how fee-brow markets are at the moment to a chance that feels more technocratic that appears to have a grip on the situation and that is what the markets are ultimately looking for here. So the pound may be swung too far when it came to what we saw under quasi-quarting maybe it's swinging too far back the other way because Jeremy Hunt isn't quasi-cozine and he is being the exact opposite of that. We'll see ultimately where it stabilizes but yeah no it's been a big bounce back Lisa. Well, a vignette into the austerity of the United Kingdom and the path forward. Guy Johnson thank you so much and of course Mr. Johnson with much more follow through on this later in the United States morning as well Lisa it's absolutely stunning to see the level of inflation there versus what we have here. Yeah although there is an acknowledgement of what it takes and globally there is a feel that the priority right now is to bring it down regardless of what it takes. Futures deteriorate negative 30 it's been a soggy two days maybe in search of information as Lisa mentioned retail retail earnings rather coming up as well and claims here in less than two hours stay with us from New York this is Bloomberg.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,192,2022-11-17 11:46:02

In the past two decades China has built large infrastructure projects in almost every country in Africa. African governments themselves said we are tired of aid and charity.

It Charles Schwab and I must say within the talk of inversion and all that, what about the stock market, what about the rail? He's in. I saw somebody the other day looking at SPX or whatever, up 18% up 17% and trying to measure the beginning of a bull market. You're too young to remember 75 or 82. I remember how do you figure out a bull market, Lizanne Saunders? When do you say bull market? So I actually think that the the retest and and move down below the mid June lows that we got in October looked healthier under the surface. You had a better sentiment underpinning and in fact, at least as of Wednesday last week, you had finally seen behavioral measures of sentiment like the book call ratio, get to the same amount of wash out pessimism, puke phase, whatever you want to call it as the attitudinal measures. And then you had a positive divergence develop at that October low where under the surface, the breadth actually was a bit improved relative to what we saw in in June. So I'd say you could you can check some boxes. However, I think from a more macro perspective, what's still ahead of us is more downward revisions to forward earnings, more stability, both in yields and the dollar. And I think we need to see stability in in housing and PMI. So I don't think you can check those boxes yet, even if you've got some better sentiment and technical underpinnings. Lizanne Saunders, these are unusual times to say the least. And Lisa and I want to talk to you on your research note, where you link in the upset in Bitcoin over to traditional equity investment. Are you suggesting that the damage in Bitcoin from 20,000 to 16,000, the uproar, the scandal, the innuendo can actually affect someone's 401k? Well, it depends on what they hold. Many certainly are investors probably don't hold a lot of crypto within their 401k, but it can sit in other parts of their overall net worth. And anybody that's been a holder of anything crypto related has suffered. And when you saw the collapse of FTX, you did get a sense of some margin calls kicking in, which forces selling in areas where there is more liquidity. I think that was one of the reasons why you saw the spike in the put call ratio. I think there might have been just some quick hedging or protection put on in the options market that may have been tied to crypto, but trying to figure out from here the ripple effects, the counterparty risk. I heard on your network and interview with somebody from the CFTC that is job is to focus on the crypto world, which is not what I do. And her response was the same as we just don't know yet. I'm surprised there hasn't been more weakness in something like Bitcoin, but I don't think this story has yet been fully told. I think there are still chapters left in this crypto story. There's a large question, Lizanne, that has to do with, are we there yet? Have the bubbles popped, right? We talk about metaphor, example, shares down nearly 70% year to date. We talk about some of the big tech names and the small tech names that have gotten eviscerated. How do we know if the bubble has popped? Well, I think there have been many of what I've been calling micro bubbles that have in some cases popped in spectacular fashion, even beyond the 70% or so when you go into the sphere of crypto or SPACs, nonprofitable tech heavily shorted. The problem though is that even if you see a bubble pop and you've got draw downs in the 70, 80, 90, 90 plus percent range, that doesn't mean you might not see at least a shorter reinflation in some of those. I think that was the knee jerk reaction on Thursday and Friday, the buying went back into some of those down the quality spectrum prior speculation driven areas of the market. And I think, you know, back to the, is it a bottom or not? I think you want to fade any sharp rally down the quality spectrum. I don't think that's where you want to be in the environment right now. But yeah, I would say those bubbles have popped, that doesn't mean they can, you know, come back to life.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,194,2022-11-17 11:54:30
17581," I don't think that's where you want to be in the environment right now. But yeah, I would say those bubbles have popped. That doesn't mean they can't come back to life at least for the short term as we've seen recently. As you talk, I think about New York Fed President John Williams said yesterday when he talked about financial stability risks and financial risks in general, not necessarily being a driver of monetary policy. It shouldn't be a driver of monetary policy, which basically was we're not going to cut just because you guys are seeing losses, basically. So at what point do you see this rhetoric believe them? Do not believe in any rate cuts and just go into long duration and hide there for as long as you can. Well, you know, it's funny that you say that because, you know, the market strengths has brought with it looser financial conditions, which is not what the Fed wants. So not only are they distinguishing between market weakness or market volatility and financial system stability, which is the right thing to distinguish. And still trying to reinforce that there is no Fed put. They're not only not going to step in simply because the market is weak. It aids them in their quest to see tighter financial condition. So if anything, we may be experiencing since August when Powell first made his comments at Jackson Hole, almost a Fed call where Fed speakers, federal open mouth committee, as we jokingly call it, have to step in and push back against looser financial conditions and any narrative that is starting to brew around, you know, a pause is imminent here. And you continually have to see them do that because I think this narrative of now pivot to pause is one that is just not yet backed by the Fed. Well, it's on. Thank you so much. Greatly appreciate it today. With Charles Schwabani equity market and the linkage there into Bitcoin as well. I'm absolutely fascinated where we are in the equity market and the shock and the silence of the cash crew and the bears. I mean, it's really, it's a really intriguing moment. And I see it day to day as we put the show together. There's just a thundering silence of the gloomper over the move that we've seen. Are you saying that they are humbled by the fact that we see the rally? Is that the way that you're going to do this season on the Bloomberg folks? And this is a one year change the Dow is out of correction stage negative 7% for one year and SPX is mid center between correction and bear market negative 16%. So they've clawed back some of the losses, right? But we've heard from the bears the the people who actually do think they're going to be further losses next year. And they're very nuanced about it because there is still money sloshing around. They're nuanced about it, perhaps because they're a surcharge, but also because right now is a nuanced moment. We're going to get to some weakness. We don't know what it's going to be. We don't know how long it's going to take. And in the meantime, people still have all of the money that hasn't yet been withdrawn from the financial system. How do you play that? And that's why you're hearing people talk about short term rally, long term, some else. Good news. Macy's is not tarjet.

This is Bloomberg surveillance with Tom Keane, Jonathan Farrow and Lisa Abramowitz. Good morning, everyone. Jonathan Farrow, Lisa Bramowitz and Tom Keane, I'm Radio on television. Bloomberg surveillance an eventful day, chancelling the ex-jecker speaking of austerity here 30 minutes ago. We move on to claims here at 830. I don't hear anybody Lisa talking about claims anymore. Well, because it's like it's so noisy and honestly, unless we get some massive spiking claims, do they ever tell us anything? Markets don't move on this because they're not necessarily looking at them as a real sign, except for ongoing strength in a labor market, which is not a good sign for markets. I'm going strength and retail. Get it yesterday. Collapse target. Terrible. Coals just out with a beat 82 cents versus 75. Don't know how that's massage. Macy's really with a remarkable performance. And it really shows that Dana Telsi said yesterday to us every story matters. Yeah, how much they've retrenched, how much they've shifted their inventories, how much they're really dealing with their real estate footprint. We'll dig into the details. We're getting some of the others as we as we speak with coals actually not doing as well.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,196,2022-11-17 12:03:11

Actually seeing their third quarter comparative sales down is 7.2% versus the estimate of 6.8%. One by one, sending a motley picture of a really difficult holiday season for a lot of people who are making a lot more difficult choices. We are must watch and must listening when a seller to you right now coming up a gentleman who's modeling out inflation, moving rapidly to a better spot summer of next year. And later on on inversion, which we're going to do right now, Ira Jersey will join us from Bloomberg Intelligence and we're thrilled to bring you Ian Lingen of BMO Capital markets with this true expertise in the bond market. Lisa, this is your wheelhouse. As we have spoke this morning, we've gone from negative 63 to negative 65 basis points of inversion. Every pro is riveted to the statistic. Why? Because it means usually within 12 months after that you get some sort of recession. And right now a lot of economists are just pricing in about a six to seven. So this is not the Fed. Right. This is just basically the world in the market, right, deciding, OK, what do we see going forward? Right now it is more profitable to invest in very short term instruments. Because that's how much this government has to pay you to lend to them over the short term, longer term. They've got confidence. Things will write itself. This is unusual and it portends pain. Were the moving parts of this in the dynamic, the heart of the matter is longer maturity bonds are bid up, price up, and their yield comes in and that forces the inversion, right? Exactly, which is the reason why the results that we're getting are so confusing, right? Macy's doing really well shares popping, 5%. We've got coal coming out doing badly, shares plunging of more than 4%. With the right guidance. Right. And basically the bifurcated picture is a hard to get a big sense of where are we now and where are we heading? What is the correct forward look when you've got execution thrown into the mix and consolidation among the strongest players? Sterling not moving much off the chance of the ejector speech on the autumnal statement, I should say, on what they're going to do about austerity in high inflation in England. We'll have to watch it. 1,1867 on Sterling. Futures deteriorate negative 24. Dow futures negative 190. The VIX doesn't give me much 24.56 oil, not part of the game. Today, how have you blossomed on fire writing about hydrocarbons? Yeah, he really has. And how much people are worried about diesel? And we've seen the White House suddenly assembling some sort of meeting on diesel. As inventories go down and prices still are around record highs. What I'm listening to today is really the thing. Please. Because we're going to get a ton of it. We're getting James Bullard, Michelle Bowman, Loretta Mester, Philip Jefferson, Neil Cushkari, all speaking today. And then later on this evening, there's a event with Charlie Evans to celebrate his retirement. And we're going to hear from Fedger J. Powell, Donald Liem, to the New York Fed, Mary Daly of San Francisco. But they're not going to be giving really central banking policy statements. That said, the message has been clear. They see downturns. They see problems in the economy. They need to see that because they really have a focus on inflation. And they're willing to raise rates. Mary Daly yesterday saying between 4.75% and 5.25% that is a terminal rate. She thinks it's reasonable. And they plan to hold it there. Today, the economic data, how quickly is this making its way into the economy 8.30 AM? We get October housing starts and building permits. Housing day is grim, just as a general state. It's grim, and it's changing at a rapid speed that isn't necessarily going to filter into some of the inflation data for some time. But in the meantime, people are feeling it in real time. Those sales are not getting done. People are not moving. There is no inventory. And when people buy, they cannot afford to buy. And Jason Furman, I've Harvard, with the observation of the last 24 hours, that when you look at current rents, what's called spot rents, the actual inflation statistics are coming down disinflating much more rapidly. Yeah. And at 10 AM, when do you get some of those October sales figures and we'll get some cents? And we've been talking about this, the earnings that have been coming out. And we did get from Macy's and Coals. And it is a tale of two different stores. Macy's doing really well with those shares popping more than 7% in the pre-market trading and Coals plunging more than 6%. Or that beautifully explained the divergence. It's just two different stories of managing two distinct customer bases. I mean, who's Macy's targeting versus who's Coals targeting? And how that is really pulling apart Coals, typically caters, to more middle income and lower income households. So how much are you going to see ongoing retrenchment among some of those stores? And as really there is.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,197,2022-11-17 12:07:40
17584," particularly Cater's to more middle income and lower income households. So how much are you going to see ongoing retrenchment among some of those stores? As really there is consolidation among the strongest. I got the futures negative 26 this morning. This is a joy. You've got some wonderful guesses wanting to drive forward the conversation. Brian Levit can do that at an Invesco Global Market Strategist. But far more buried in his note is to model out the path to 3.2% inflation by the summer of next year. Many would say Brian that's a world turned upside down. What happens to our investment portfolios, equities and bonds if we get 11, 3.2%. Yeah, the reason I came up with that is just saying over the last four months inflation's average about 0.3 a month. You continue to do that through June of 2024. You're at 3.2% inflation. And right now it's a market that's trading on whether inflation is coming in better or worse relative to expectations. So we don't need it to be good. We need it to be better relative to expectations. As that happens, then we're likely to see that Fed pause. It's like the old Coca-Cola commercials, the pause that refreshes. And so that is what the markets are responding to. Now maybe they get a little bit ahead of themselves in the short term. Right. As inflation comes down, should set the stage for a recovery. Do I want to be widely diversified or is it active, alpha generating, individual stock and bond selection or sector selection that will matter? Well, it should be a more, it should be an environment more for active management. Particularly if you look at the bigger indices, the bigger indices are still heavily concentrated in some of those larger names where those technicals on those stocks still look a bit broken. Whereas if you start to think about more of a recovery trade, more value oriented parts in the market tend to do well, more of the cyclical, smaller mid-capitalization, that suggests that you either want an active manager looking at that or you may want to consider different weighting methodologies, whether that is equal weight, which will be more value oriented or smaller or lower capitalization, or whether that's even something that's dynamic, that shifts across different parts of the different factors in the market throughout different cycles. So, Brian. Different parts of the cycle. When we look out right now and people try to get optimistic, others come in like Axel Weber, the former chair of UBS, as he spoke at NEF and said this, I wouldn't be surprised if we have further episodes in the market where the combined rate increases in withdrawal of liquidity will lead to pockets of weaknesses in financial markets because of leveraged strategies getting cold. How much are you waiting for the next shoot to drop, so many people are? Yeah, I mean, look, we have volatility in these markets until there's policy clarity. People always ask me when does volatility come to markets? Well, when there's policy uncertainty and the challenge here is we've been dealing with policy uncertainty since the fall. And so that's a long time to be grappling with it, particularly when the economy is deteriorating. Usually you see a fed step in and ease things. So there are some challenges. We haven't seen a big blowout event. We haven't seen the VIX to 40. So it's not to say that there is potential challenge in here, but for intermediate term investors, there are already down peak to drop 26% in the U.S. market. That's about average for a recession. And you start to think about what that recovery looks like and that recovery is going to be driven by inflation coming down pretty rapidly, which is also what the break-even markets are suggesting. Just quickly, Brian, does tech reassert itself when the market does recover? Well, it's pretty rare from something that brought you into it, takes you out of it as well. Now, the valuations on a lot of the tech names are looking more attractive. Typically what happens when you move from more of a contractionary environment to a recovery, the more value-oriented parts of the market tend to outperform. And then you have to consider structurally what rate and inflation environment are we going to end in? Are we going back to a 1.5% environment or are we going to settle in at a 2.5% environment? If it's a 2.5% environment, then it's likely to be more of the value-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,198,2022-11-17 12:11:51
17585," Are we going back to a 1.5% environment, or are we going to settle into a 2.5% environment? If it's a 2.5% environment, then it's likely to be more of the value leadership than what was a significant growth leadership in a very weak growth low inflation environment over the last cycle. Brian Levin, thank you so much with Invesco and global market strategy. It's not, I want to make clear, this is not an economist modeling on 3.2% inflation to the middle of next year, but it's an idea of what's the what if that happens? And again, that's with the one year on, you know, you move on and you get a new set of statistics as well. Lisa, by massive acclaim of our giant international audience, it's time now for World Cup chat. Both of us are so involved. Exactly, two Americans faking that they know anything about soccer. What's amazing about this and thank you to the athletic for getting me through this. We have to do this for John. We miss him so much. And the bottom line is they're sending two people from England. One is hardly played since October, and the other only played like part of the game last week. And they've convinced the coach to go to Qatar, the wonderful Kelvin Phillips and the guy named Walker. I don't even know, but that's the debates that are going on. These guys are all injured, as John says. Yeah, well, I will say that I'm not even going to pretend because all the people, all our reviewers, who are well more educated on this, are just going to sit there being like, really, John does not want to see this. No, he does not. He's rolling over in his bed right now, just saying, Oh, you and I have an Argentinian bar. All right, let's go to New York to what? That's the only way to do this. And that folks is your World Cup chat for the day. Stay with us if you can. Keeping you up today with news from around the world with the first word. I'm Lisa Mateo, Ukraine's president, Vladimir Zelensky has laid out his conditions for peace. Zelensky says only the return of territory taken by Russia will allow an end to the war. And that includes Crimea, which was annexed in 2014. Crimea is part of Ukraine. This is not just a state within a state. It's part of our country and part of our sovereignty. Therefore, indeed, the occupation of the Crimea and Donbass will bring the end to the war. Zelensky spoke to the Bloomberg new economy forum in Singapore. In the UK, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt is outlining a series of tax hikes and spending cuts aimed at getting public finances under control. The threshold at which the top tax rate is paid has been lowered. Hunt also expanded the windfall tax in the oil and gas sector. He says the moves will total $65 billion in new revenues and savings. More than a week after the elections, Republicans have won a narrow majority in the House that gives him the power to halt President Biden's agenda. Still, their slim margin is a letdown. The party is counted on decisive election results as a springboard for the 2024 presidential race. And former FTX CEO Sam Bankman Fried is telling his side of the company's collapse.

17586," The standard way venture firms work is you commit capital, let's say over a five year investment period, something like that. Yeah, exactly. And then the fund just typically asks maybe 10 years or so. 15, well these days are longer so often 15 often the tail extends out to 20 years. These companies take a long time to develop. And somebody that invests in a venture fund today should be trying to get rates of return of 20% would you say or more? Top and venture is sort of three X-net of fees. You know, ideally you're hoping for more than that, you're hoping for five X or more. You're illiquid the entire time, right? So you hope to get paid for their liquidity. And today, maybe 20 to 40% if things go well is sort of baseline. Let's take another subject. Such a post somebody says, I don't want to invest in and reason where it's I want to be Mark Andreessen. How does somebody become a venture capitalist? What are the skill sets for good venture capital? Is it a high degree of intelligence, hard work, lot of luck, dress the right part, don't wear a tie. What are the things that make one a good venture capitalist? So the high least successful VCs historically are very idiosyncratic. You know, people from very different backgrounds, Mike Morris is a former newspaper reporter, John Doris of former chip salesman. You've got people with very different indigenous buyer has more of this kind of blue chip investment background. You have people with very different backgrounds and experiences. And so I think it's some set of skills and some set of knowledge and then there seems to be a taste component to it. It's really hard to measure and really hard to predict.

17587," a jack of all trades and a master of none. In other words, we're not gonna try to solve market problems at the potential expense of not targeting inflation. Inflation is the preeminent concern and they're going hard against that. I can't wait to see how Loretta Mester plays off that. I have such respect for Dr. Mester at Cleveland and the mathematics of all this theory and mumbo jumbo. What are we gonna hear today following on from John Williams? Probably a similar message because even the doves really have been pretty hard. They all agree inflation is the foremost concern. The lag times perhaps are in question. But get a go up and ask. I keep going back to what she said at the IMF. She raised concerns about the collective causes or the collective consequence of all of the rate hikes that you're seeing around the world. But then she said that people have to stay the course because we cannot have another 1970s. They cannot fail with their mandate. We now turn to Washington. Ann Marie Horton mopping up the G20 meeting. She is in Bali, Indonesia. The president is home. They always come home Ann Marie. And he comes home to what I'm gonna say with a immense respect for the lady of Baltimore and then her San Francisco speaker Pelosi that is front and center. It is Pelosi Thursday. There's no other way about it. Frame this for our international audience Ann Marie. Does speaker Pelosi go and see the president today? That's a great question Tom. I'm not sure she goes and sees him, but clearly they likely would have had a conversation with her office saying yesterday that she's going to talk and announce her future plans today. She insinuated recently in an interview with CNN that part of her decision making on whether or not she passes on the leadership post and doesn't want to continue on that and retires is the fact that also what happened to her husband recently at the end of October when he was attacked with a hammer or with someone breaking into their home. So she obviously is consulting with her family as well. But for international audience and for the domestic audience clearly speaker Pelosi has been in the limelight for decades as a politician and then of course really being the driver behind the Democrats and the House, the first woman to lead the chamber and today we'll hear what she has to say. And you know you look at what Greg Valleier has to say. It's not just speaker Pelosi. He's talking about a shift, a huge generational shift because many in the Democratic Party want to move away from the octogenarians, not just her, but Mr. Hoyer and Clyde Warren as well. I was stunned. I had forgotten Stenny Hoyer of Maryland is 83 years old. Is there's the same tendency in the Republican Party? I believe they have a 76 year old running for president. Again, are the Republicans looking for you as well? Well, I think they're looking for something different even if it's not youth, maybe youth with individuals that are also potentially, no one has come out, but potentially vying for that top spot. It's interesting when you look at the Republican Party because on one hand, of course, we've talked about this all week, Ken Griffin, Steve Schwartzman, these individuals no longer want to back the president. You heard from Mike Pence, the president Trump's former vice president, saying he thinks there are other options, and you are hearing that people want to move away. Republicans want to move away from former president Trump, who's obviously their bearer right now, their leader. And then you look at what McCarthy is dealing with as he set to become a likely speaker of the House. He's dealing with the fact that he needs 218 to vote for him, iron clad in January, to make sure he can get that gavill. What he's dealing with is the fact that he also has a number of individuals on the very right of his party that he is going to have to act, yes, to make sure he gets their vote to become speaker. So to say that Trump is long gone would not be correct, but obviously at the very top levels of the party, they also want fresh blood. We do now have majority in the House, as we've been talking about all morning, 218 have been selected for the Republicans and increase about eight seats. They needed five to get the majority. They just squeaked through not the red wave that many people had expected, as we really parsed through the results of why there was not a red wave. What's the post-wortem looking like? It's a great question. There's going to be a big post mortem when we've talked about this recently as...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,201,2022-11-17 12:24:53
17588," There was not a red wave. What's the post-Mortem looking like? It's a great question. There's going to be a big post-Mortem, and we've talked about this recently as well, in, I think, two areas. One, the fact that it wasn't the red wave more of a ripple. What did the Republicans not get out the message that they wanted, which was it was the Biden administration or the Democrats fault for things that all of the constituents across America feel were just higher inflation. And how are the Republicans not able to turn that message around and say our plan was better? Potentially, the fact that they were saying that they wanted to make some cuts to issues like Social Security and Medicare. Did that not help them at the very end of the campaign? Because the Democrats really harness that. The second in the post-Mortem is you have to take a look at deep blue, New York. The Republicans were able to squeeze through because they flipped a number of Democratic seats, just a handful, but enough, in this very liberal state that mostly always goes blue. So these are, I think, two post-Mortem's for both sides, the GOP and the Democrats following this midterms. Emory, thank you. And safe travels. Amory Horton with terrific reporting from the G20 meetings, and particularly the meeting of the President of China and the President of the United States. Lisa, you mentioned this earlier, and you really wonder what the... But maybe it's one of the one's stability in Washington is a bipartisan effort to put China in its place. You'll have to see how that works out. Well, and how consistent the message is when there is also a feeling of a need for one another still and talk of some sort of collaborative effort. I don't know. I was looking actually at some comments from different companies, and it's really all over the place in terms of whether they're staying in China, prioritizing it or getting out, certainly the banking industry, still seeing that they need to have a footprint in China. And I feel the world's second-based economy. Let's get out front and yield right now as we've got Ian Lingen and I with Jersey coming up. A 369-10 year becomes a 3.72 percent tenure. Ealed 2-year yield, we had the 5 percent chat days ago, 4.37 percent, shows a stunning shift that we've seen in what is in nascent... I guess I'm going to call the nascent bull market. Lisa, the real yield, we had a 160, 161, we were going, what if we get to 2 percent? The 10-year real yield 1.40 percent, I think it's been under-disgust. And this is the conundrum for the Fed, right? The more that people start to pile into long-term debt, the more that that ease is financial conditions, as you said, a lesser real yield, and sends people back to risk. So this is what they're trying to push against in rhetoric that's increasingly hawkish even as they talk about shifting down to a 50-basis point rate hike next month. Am I off the mark? Am I off the mark on its a zombie roll-up 2023? I mean, the energy out there is all of a sudden money costs... there's a cost of money, there's a cost of money. Where people are looking for that is in the private markets, because that's the area that hasn't perhaps seen the fallout, it doesn't see as much ready cap it already to flood in.

We're going to do London and do austerity, but first an austere view of retail names, Lisa with a stock report. What do you begin? Well, let's talk about the two names that reported earnings this morning because it is such an interesting differentiation of the haves and the have-nots. Let's start with Macy's. They reported better than expected earnings. They increased their full year forecast. Those shares popping more than 8% now and when you look through some of the results, they're managing their inventory as well. And this really is one of the key points for retailers. How much stuff do they have stockpiled that they have to sell at a discount? Macy's actually attribute some of the gains to some of their online tracking systems. We always talked about blockchain actually being useful for some of these companies. It makes them able to better manage this and inventories were only up 4% in the third quarter, which is actually really, that's amazing. That's way better than target yesterday. That's way better than target and it's the differentiation between the haves and the have-nots. For the have-nots, calls with draws full year guidance. It also lost its CEO unexpectedly and is looking at inventories that have still been incredibly high. Those shares lower by 4%. How much is this execution story at this point? Let you decide to buy.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,203,2022-11-17 12:33:35
17590," incredibly high. Those shares lower by 4%. How much is this execution story? At this point, what you decide to buy, how you decide to sell it, where you discount, how quickly you discount, whether you end up doing this. And when I talk about an execution story, it's been all year, macy's year to date, down 24%, 25%, coals down almost 40%. So the differentiation continues after earnings that confirm that part of this is a broad statement is what portion of America is in recession now. I don't like this idea we're all in it, we're not. There's a huge body of America really struggling as represented by calls. Which is the reason why what you buy and what you decide to sell may make the difference between the winners and losers, right? And Walmart gained share in the grocery business, which people are still buying. You're seeing the number of purchases come down with the ticket items of big purchases. The actual headline figure go up because people are spending more in bulk on one item and then retrenching in other areas. Well, how about O'Aryan on Britain on the United Kingdom as well. The United Kingdom's office for budget responsibility confirms the intensification of stagflation. It is unique austerity in the United Kingdom. And a brief as here, the ramifications for the United States as well with standard charter. Sarah Qun has had a year up in America's research. Sarah, thank you so much for joining us. What is the level of austerity in the United Kingdom? Well, it's 55, 55 billion pounds worth over the next five years. So that's going to be austerity through real freeze in public sector spending and creeping tax increases. There's a big hole in public finances that needs to be filled and the chances announced the measures that we had expected really to try to fill that gap. I want you to talk about scale and magnitude. I think I have to remind myself of this folks every day. We equate US, UK analysis. The nominal GDP of the United States is 23 trillion dollars. The United Kingdom is 14% is large. It's a much, much smaller economy. Sarah, you and do they have the scale, the magnitude, the degrees of freedom to solve this conundrum? Yes, they do, but it's quite a tough ask because at the same time we're going through what looks like to likely to be a prolonged recession. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility is forecasting a contraction of GDP of 1.4% next year and then a very mild uptake in 2024 of just 1.3%. And that's at a time when we will still have inflation way above the 2% bank of England target. So it's a difficult backdrop in which to try to find savings and try to stabilize that to GDP. The expectation is that to GDP is going to continue to rise up in the high 90s as a percent until for the next few years before then starting to edge lower. Sarah, did you hear the chancellor really blame the US for the inflation that the UK was feeling? Well, there was a blame on global factors for inflation and for broader problems. Clearly, there's been the invasion of Ukraine and the impact that that's had on commodity prices has been a feature. What he glossed over was the impact that we're feeling from the weakness of sterling, which has of course raised import costs more than otherwise would be the case. So there's quite a focus on external problems that have caused the recession here in the UK, but not too much focus on what's self-generated. How much do you actually see this budget is sustainable? How much they're playing to bring debt down? How quickly given the 11.1% CPI? It's sustainable to the extent that it had to be realistic. Markets responded very, very poorly to what was a completely unrealistic budget just a couple of months ago. And so one of the primary drivers for today's budget was to ensure that markets weren't upset. And in fact, we've seen very little movement in guild yields. We've seen very little movement in the pound. Sustainability though, of course, when we're going through a recession.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,204,2022-11-17 12:37:51
17591," In fact, we've seen very little movement in guilds, we've seen very little movement in the pound. Sustainability, though, of course, when we're going through a recession and having had very severe public sector cuts over the past decade, that is going to be quite tough for the living in the UK. Sarah, I had a line that I'm going to say as an amateur launches back to Clement Atley and maybe the reason why Churchill was shown the door after World War II, the United Kingdom Office of Budget Responsibilities sees record fall in household disposable income. And to see record fall, folks, that goes back to at least Henry VIII, I am, I am. I mean, that's a huge headline of the pain that's out there right now. Do they have to deep-brexit the United Kingdom? Do they have to reverse selected Brexit policies to help jumpstart this economy? I think that there's very little appetite at the moment in government or even outside government to reverse Brexit. And indeed, the chancellor was doubling down on some of the, removing some of the EU regulations that apparently are holding back the UK, but that's not necessarily going to be kickstarting growth anytime soon. You're right about the big collapse in real incomes. Right wages are just rising way behind inflation. Savings are being squeezed. We're already seeing signs of recession the economy contracted in third quarter. And I think that there's worse to come. And this is at the environment where we're tightening fiscal policy and where the Bank of England is continuing to raise rates. Lisa, then why is Sterling gone 103 to 118 based on what Dr. Huynne just said? Because there is stability for the first time. And there is some sort of policy predictability and there is policy predictability. And there is policy predictability globally in terms of interest rates with central bankers raising rates pretty consistently. This tightening cycle. And we talk about the lag effects. Sarah, you talk about the crimping of household budgets. When do we know what the lag effect is of all of this tightening? How long will it take before we see peak pain and peak effect on inflation? I think that's going to take us another few months and we're probably looking into the second half of next year. For the full effect of the Bank of England's tightening so far to really be felt in lowering inflation. And of course, in the UK, we're likely to see energy bills rising again in April, which will further slow the decline in inflation. So we're in it for the long haul. 2023 is still going to be a high inflation and recessionary environment for the UK. Sarah, thank you so much for the brief. Just outstanding there, folks. David Blancheflower says there's Brexit. Maybe there's some politics involved. And you get up to not stochastic where inflation comes up and comes down. But Lisa is just not coming down. I don't hear that model from anybody in the United Kingdom. Yeah, and you talk about, yeah, well, you talk about Brexit. And you talk about how much the scenario has changed. There was a story in the Financial Times about Ireland. And how they bet really big on big tech, right? Because they were trying to lure in a lot of international companies. But they're tax policy and now they're disproportionately struggling in the face of layoffs because of the retrenchment that you're seeing in big tech around the world. It just shows all of the myriad problems that are kind of facing all of the different nations that also have had massive structural shift. On a Thursday, let's sell the data coming forward. And we've underplayed this today. But we do see, and Lizanne Sanders, I think, has been great with her charts on the complete collapse of housing collating and all the national experts housing starts survey down, building permits survey down month over months. Maybe it's better than the Grimnas last week. We'll see what the revisions are. And then, of course, we have claims which is not housing, but one indicator there that's been actually pretty fully employed. You pointed me to the Stalas Fed report that was put out this week. Martinez Garcia outstanding. It was outstanding. I can confirm it. Did I do okay? It was great. I appreciate you passing that log. And I was running more behind it.

17592," Roth that was built into the housing market by all historic measures during the pandemic. So how do we unwind from that? What does that mean for household wealth? Should we tell a dirty little secret here of surveillance, we don't actually like do this research ourselves, folks. We'll steal from anyone to say that the ginormous institution coming out of McChesley Martin in 1951 are the regional feds with young PhDs that are eager to do brilliant work like Dr. Martinez Garcia at the Dallas Fed. He's out of Spain. I believe he's out of Penn and I can't remember where else I'm sorry the brain freezes, but there's eight pages of brilliance by young PhD. And really parsing through the effect on the broader economy, you do get some sort of housing downturn and the fear of some sort of spiral-ing. But you know this is what people keep pushing back against. There isn't the leverage in the system. There isn't the leverage in the housing market. Housing market there at 8.30 this morning we'll have much more on that. John writing will weigh in as well as chief economic advisor, Breene, Capitol. Coming up Ian Lingen on Curving Version. Ira Jersey on Curving Version. They wear this Bloomberg surveillance. Keeping you up to date with News from around the world with the first word, I'm Lisa Mateo. In the UK, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt unveiled his plan to fill a fiscal gap with tax hikes and spending cuts. The government will increase the windfall tax on oil and gas companies. They will also lower the threshold for those who pay the top 45 percent individual tax rate. And there will be an almost real-term standstill in spending on public services at a time when demand for them is growing. It's a power shift in Washington, although not as big as Republicans had hoped for. The GOP has won a narrow majority in the House that gives them the ability to block President Biden's agenda. House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy tweeted that Americans are ready for a new direction and Republicans are ready to deliver. Democrats had controlled the House the last four years. There was a surprising public confrontation at the G20 summit in Indonesia. China's President Xi Jinping accused Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of leaking details of a private meeting between the two. Xi told Trudeau the leak was inappropriate. Trudeau responded that Canadians believe in free, open, and frank dialogue. The workers at Starbucks who are seeking union contracts will stage a day-long strike today at more than 100 stores. Now, they say that management isn't bargaining in good faith. Starbucks workers united has unionized about 260 of the chain's 9,000 corporate run sites in the U.S. Starbucks says it will respect the workers' rights to protest lawfully. And in Europe, auto sales rose in October for the third month in a row. Still, there's concern that deteriorating economic conditions are starting to put off buyers.

17593," While Tesla's in the like make for good headlines, the reality is that even if every car on the roads today won't be electric, it wouldn't be enough to curb global emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions from transportation account for about 29% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. So what about the other 71%? Buildings across America burn fossil fuels to operate. What we want to do is make that all electric. Instead of burning oil and gas to give us the energy and electricity we need, we want to do 100% clean energy, all electric. We want to turn buildings into Tesla's. Just like a Tesla or an electric vehicle is all electric with no fossil fuels, we want to do that with our buildings. If we can do it in one building, we can do it in all buildings, and if we do it in all buildings, we'll reduce 30% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.

One day on Bloomberg. In the past two decades, China has built large infrastructure projects in almost every country in Africa. African governments themselves said we are tired of aid and charity. We want to do trade. We want to be treated like partners. The Chinese came along and said great, we don't do aid in charity. We want to do business with you. Global gateway will mobilize 300 billion euros till 2027. Now the US and Europe are answering back with their own infrastructure initiatives to counter China. But African experts are skeptical. China has been that guy around the corner with a bouquet of flowers to Africa, the US, Europe and the UK. Of time and time again say be careful of the flowers you see out of the window. They have funds on them. We're all certainly trying to figure out when the point is correct for the Fed to slow down when the tightening is going to slow down and it really does come back to a middle-class driven inflation at this point. The Fed ultimately needs to go very aggressively as they have already to just start to get a crack in the real economy. Marvard Lowell, state treats senior global macro strategist was piercing yesterday on the jumble that we're living right now. Again in 45 minutes we get claims out and they're not into some important housing. I don't know which is more important today Lisa claims you're housing. You make the call. I just made the call. I mean we've never seen the rates of change in housing we're seeing right now. And the potential wealth effect as potentially things reverse a bit more. Futures to tier 8 negative 25 has become negative 36 on SPX call at 9 tenths of a percent. There's a real weight right now to the tape. For those watching Bitcoin, Bitcoin has remarkably stable here 16,500 in the bond market, the curve inversion negative 66 basis points is truly historic. I read Jersey scheduled to be with us later. And right now we are thrilled and honored to bring in for global Wall Street and Lincoln. He's had a U.S. rate strategy at BMO Capital markets. I called up Jersey and I said I'm only talking to people today that have read Frank Fobosie that covered a cover in the bond world folks.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,207,2022-11-17 12:50:50
17594," great strategy at BMO Capital Markets. I called up Jersey and I said, I'm only talking to people today that have read Frank Fobosi cover to cover. In the bond world folks, like Lingen's world, you have a Frank Fobosi textbook of some 900 pages that prices out hardcovered $132. And only Lingen has read the thing covered to cover is well. Is this curve in version in Frank Fobosi's classic text? Frank Fobosi was not looking for a curve in version of this depth. I think more importantly, what Frank would have said is that this is a mispricing that needs to be rectified in the short order. We are taking the other side of that trade. We think that there's more in version to be realized and the most important in version inverted curve is Fed funds versus 10-year yields, not just two's versus 10. So you went from the vanilla spread of two year, 10 year, out to the many different spreads you look at and you're going from very short term out to 10. The dynamic of two different yields moving around, which pros are encyclopedic on and frankly our audience is like say what, is it about focusing on the 10-year dynamic or the two year or the Fed funds dynamic, which is more important? At this stage, I would say that the two year yield reflects monetary policy expectations in the very short term, but the 10 and 30 year rates, that's the market simply moving on to what's next and what's next is going to be a pretty significant economic slowdown. So the inversion is simply a tail of two different curves more than anything else. The yield curve contraction right now presents a huge challenge for the Fed Reserve. Massive, because what you're seeing is the more they lean into hawkish talk, the more people buy longer term treasuries, which ease financial conditions. It is this really difficult situation a paradox for the Fed Reserve. At what point do they break something with rate hikes in order to get the market to say, even if you have lower rates, it is not good for risk assets. I think that ultimately what ends up happening is the Fed's watching real rates as much as anything else, real rates remain elevated by the standard of last decade or so, and eventually we're going to see a more significant pullback in risk assets and equities. I've personally been surprised that the S&P 500 is roughly 10% off of the lows that also contributes to yield. It contributes to easier financial conditions. So the more quickly the market is willing to price in a pivot, the more the Fed will ultimately need to do. At least you see that in the Bloomberg Financial Conditions Index, which is one standard deviation now and is rally back more accommodative to negative point eight two standard deviations. So this really raises an issue, especially as you hear John Williams basically saying, if we break something, we're going to keep rates where they are. We're not going to lower rates. And then people in the market say, are you, we don't really believe it. So how do you view this, right, in terms of if something breaks, what does that even mean for the Fed to get some sort of response? Is the market right? So I think that there's an argument that the Fed is going to break something and allow it to be broken for longer than it has in prior cycles. So is that the S&P 500 down 25% from here? Maybe it's not down 50. If stocks are off 50%, the Fed is going to need to be respond in one way, shape, or form. But what I think is more interesting when we look at what's being priced in the market, there's an argument, there's 50 basis points of rate cuts priced in for 2023. Essentially that's what we're looking at. That's either 100% confidence of 50 or 25% confidence of 200. But what does it mean for something to break? What are you looking for to break that would even cause a Fed response? So a stronger dollar leads to emerging markets, under strain, defending their currencies. That could be a contagion issue. That's very much top of mind. But this cycle, I expect that what will ultimately break is going to be in the real economy. It will be on the household level, and it will be spending and will be faced with a traditional economic slowdown that the Fed is content to allow play out for a while. I got 14 questions. Let me go to the chancellor of the Exchequer who opened his autumn statement today saying so much was international ramifications upon his beleaguered United Kingdom. Is our curving version a symbol of a Fed misguided that is redounding upon other nations, including Britain? I think that the issues facing external markets are in part a function of the fact that the Fed has pushed back against becoming the de facto.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,208,2022-11-17 12:55:19
17595," I think that the issues facing external markets are in part a function of the fact that the Fed has pushed back against becoming the de facto central bank to the world and has been focused primarily on the U.S. and that has come at the expense of other economies. What does this inversion mean for our banks and the financial stability John Williams wanted to ignore yesterday? What does it mean for JPMorgan Bank of America, the superregionals, and smaller banks out there doing business with business? So traditionally an inverted yield curve is bad for the financial sector because a steep curve implies the ability to create money via carry. The reality is though higher rates are generally better for banks than lower rates and so if we are generally in a higher rate environment I think that we'll find the financial sector not responding the way it typically has to an inverted yield curve. What are you going to do here? What's this change in strategy for the next week or so? I think that the market is getting poised for a breakout even more inverted from here. We're looking at more. Give me a scale, come on, two tenths of a percent. What's another? Negative 75 basis points in two stands, path police resistance. So we're on the edge of vulgar inversion. We're on the edge of 79, 89, 80 inversion. I would say we could get as deep as a negative 100 basis points by the end of the year. What does that do to our listeners and viewers? This is folks 45 years. I've never heard this. What does it do to us? I think that it really leaves us in an anxious position where we don't know how far the feds ultimately going to need to push things because it will be coming out with even more hawkish rhetoric because as Lisa points out that will lead to a lessening of financial or using financial conditions. Did he just say there's going to be extra special more fed speak? Oh, it's the fed reality show. And this is what people are watching and we all cling to every word as much as we want to say. Does it really matter if they keep talking? Well, yeah, actually markets move out every time they do. Our esteemed team that puts a show together every day called up in Linga today and begged. Thank you so much for coming in. Great. Thank you. We're going to continue this discussion as well. Right now we have to shift to Bitcoin with some headlines out here. And Lisa, I'll let you translate. Katie Griefel's not here to translate for me. So you're in charge. So basically FTX bankruptcy lawyers are not happy with their client. Basically, they're saying his tweeting, Bankman Fried's tweeting, has been complicated their case and the direct messages. We can get into that in a little bit. It's really quite notable.

You're just a less toxic company than some of the other oil majors. Well, the first thing to say is that, you know, I'm a big believer in we need to put ourselves in other persons' shoes in life in general. And so I understand that point of view. And I get that people have that perspective. I don't agree with that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,209,2022-11-17 12:59:42
17596," And so I understand that point of view and I get that people have that perspective. I don't agree with that obviously, but I understand where they're coming from. We have an enormous challenge as society, which is to provide the world with reliable, affordable and clean energy. That's what society wants, that's what society needs. And I believe in my heart that a company like BP is actually one of the few companies in the world who can actually make that happen. We can talk about the things that we're going to grow in over the coming years. And I find it hugely exciting and energizing for our organization. But that's what the world needs and you simply can't go against the grain of society. You can't defy gravity. And that's why we're making the change that we're making.

The Fed ultimately needs to go very aggressively to just start to get a crack in the real economy. There needs to be additional paying felt to really bring down price pressures back in line with what the Fed is looking for. The risk is for higher rates, I think, especially in light of an economy that's still resilient. That's the thing to keep in mind is there's a lot of money on the sideline. A year from now, we might be in a world where inflation is not five anymore or four. Maybe it's three. This is Bloomberg's surveillance with Tom Keane, Jonathan Farrow, and Lisa Abramowitz. Forget the Macy's Day Parade, it is the Fed Parade. And this is Bloomberg's surveillance. Tom Keane, Lisa Abramowitz, John Farrow off today. On a well-deserved day off, we do continue good morning. I'm really right now, I am saying, Tom, this is all about a Fed that has one message with Jim Buller coming out. We are not yet at sufficiently restrictive levels. Yeah, that's the Fed talking. We'll get much more today as well. But you see it in the markets. Let's get right to the data check. Is Lisa, you open SPX negative one down, negative one percent, Nasek negative one percent. These are markets moving on Fed speak. Well, this is St. Louis Fed at President James Bullard, Jim Bullard coming out right now, saying that Fed policy is not yet at sufficiently restrictive levels. Hikes have only had limited impact so far on inflation. This is the lag effects, but that isn't going to stop them, right? Rates need to be increased further to curb inflation. And this really is the key. They are going to keep raising until they see some progress. And right now, whether it's retail sales, whether it's other economic indicators are not seeing it. Yeah, 10 year yield up six basis points, 3.75 percent off 3.69 percent yesterday. Lisa, to me, what is so, so important here is there's a crew out there saying they're beginning to see substantial tea leaves showing a lesser inflation. Jason Furman is incredibly important to eat yesterday at a housing. And we get more housing data here at a 30. The tea leaves aren't it?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,210,2022-11-17 13:03:52
17597," He's showing a lesser inflation. Jason Furman's incredibly important tweet yesterday at a housing and we get more housing data here at a 30. The tea leaves aren't enough. And this to me is what's telling. That when markets get optimistic about the tea leaves, Fed officials come out and they say, just stop it. Just stop it. If Jim Bullard was a professor at Indiana University, it'd be a different Jim Bullard. These guys, including the vice chairman, have an institutional responsibility to be exposed and alter cautious. They have, they don't have the luxury of being academic. They have to affect markets in real time. And this is where the game'smanship comes into play where they're saying we're gonna go hard and go into this and then we're gonna cap the S&P level basically. I mean, for all intents and purposes, it's essentially what they're saying. We don't wanna see things rallying that have risk. And markets are saying, we don't buy it. We think that you're gonna cave. We got this incredibly important set of guests here and we will do Bitcoin and FTX and all the rest of it here. It ate 45, Katie Gryphal, and thrilled is dark in the door and we'll get around here on real uproar within the, what do I call it? The blockchain, is it the Bitchain? Well, it's crypto assets. Do you think it's fair to say? Bitchain, space. I'm already getting hate mail on this. It's not fair, I'm getting hate mail. It's working out. Negative 41 on SBX futures a full 1% down, down, negative 307. The VIX doesn't move yet, but I don't believe that number. 24.88 yield, I mentioned up 7 basis points, 3.76% on the 10-year yield. I do agree it's off of the Bullard statements. That curve inversion, thank you Ian Lingen for joining negative 66 basis points stunning over 45 years with global Wall Street truly back to the time of Voker. Oil, we barely mentioned this morning, oil at 90, oil's down a little bit. Maybe some economic slowdown bet there, $91 on Brent Crude. I don't know what to do with foreign exchange today. The dollar string. The chancellor moves currency, most sterling rather a little weaker and a little bit of dollar strength. I do a little bit. Yeah, you did great. But what we're seeing right now is a market that continually is surprised by the same message being sent by the Fed over and over again. Why is the market surprised? I don't understand, let's speak to the market. Be out of cur is going to represent the market today. Go ahead of investment strategies at Bernstein Private Wealth. I'm curious from your perspective, why is the market surprised that the Fed keeps getting more and more hawkish in the rhetoric? I'm not sure that the market's surprised. I think the market's trying to find its footing the same things that you've been quoting this morning. All investors are struggling with. It is a macro-led market. We're focused on earnings and differentiation and companies, but there's no doubt about it. That inflation, inflation, inflation, like you said earlier, is the key to market direction. What's the sense of consumer spending? And I say this because at the same time that you have Fed officials saying, we're not seeing signs of slowing. It's not trickling and as quickly as we would like. We see the likes of Coles having a really hard time. We see the likes yesterday from some others having a really hard time, target, not doing well. How do you parse out the winners from the losers with some sort of narrative that really gives you a sense of where things are heading? Well, there's two different narratives that you can start to interpret from the retail sales data as well as the earnings from these companies. First of all, you look at the macro picture and say, what does that mean about what the consumer has left to spend and where in the consumer spending bucket? Who's getting most affected? And there's no doubt about it that the low in consumer is squeezed more. That's not surprising. That's what we've historically seen when you see food and gas prices up over time. That's what's happening. Walmart, we know that they noted over 100,000 consumers are spending more on groceries at Walmart. But then you start to differentiate between these retailers and you look at a franchise like Costco, membership-based, huge loyalty, done an excellent job, not just on supply chain but on labor. And it makes a big difference. So I think when it comes to the micro, the time now is for stock selection and company differentiation. Companies are different in how they're able to manage the chain and labor as well. I'm talking my book. But what I love in your research note and you get down to something that was gospel in my house, SPX midterms, up 16%, presidential year, up 8%. You got to be kidding me. The history of these midterms we just had inflicted upon us is double digit SPX return. Well, we had to be careful saying history always repeats. I'm staying with me. It's so busy. Stay with me here. It would be awesome to see a 16% recovery post the midterms that is history said Tom and that is what we've published. But you got to get back to fundament.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,211,2022-11-17 13:08:23
17598," It would be awesome to see a 16% recovery post the midterms that is history said Tom and that is what we've published but you got to get back to fundamentals and state balance. I mean at least this point earlier about surprise. You don't want to be playing the game of trying to switch asset classes and sectors in a fast way here because there is so much surprise that's possible in the market and I think the midterms are some element of surprise as well obviously. So I think you have to be humble and you have to be balanced. Okay, you got to be balanced but do you buy quality? I mean by small pack small cap quality mid cap quality best stuff Apple whatever give us a differentiation of those sectors to create the active alpha you're predicting. Yeah, you must have read our note. Quality growth is an area by people read the note. I don't read the notes. Quality growth is an area that we like and I think we like it most in large cap space. Small caps are interesting as well but obviously we feel we could be entering recessionary period and even if that recession is mild small caps could be more vulnerable. Lisa wants to jump in here but this is critical. Are you going to see record use of cash by those big cap quality names? I think we could. I think they've got more strength in their balance sheets. They've got more ability to maintain quality just on labor as well. Obviously you're seeing cuts and ad spending and in tech but there's still quality names like Microsoft like visa that we find to try. I know this is what you're going to do. I know exactly where you're heading. But I do wonder Vietta just to build on that because it is an important point. The sort of question of what's going to lead to the catharsis where you get capitulation by companies to be purchased at a discount from other companies at what point you get some sort of wash out. What are you looking for to signal and I understand company specific but on a broad level are we there yet? How do you know in terms of company risk taking to learn some valuations in terms of the type of investors? Yeah I don't think we're at total capitulation. I mean we think we may have seen the bottom. We feel like we're in a range bound market somewhere in the 3600 to 4000 in the next six to 12 months on the S&P. Our base case is for an earnings decline that we have not yet seen factored into the market. Those bottom up earnings forecasts are just starting to come down. You're starting to see 22 come down, 4Q come down, 23 hasn't yet been touched. Right. And that's because that visibility is so murky everybody's struggling with the ultimate fed question. But you're seeing companies starting to respond to cost management. That's going to play out on margins. And that bad news for people is unfortunately good news ultimately for the market and for earnings. What's fundamental here is we now have a risk free rate. We now have finance somewhat back to what we're weaned on. And my great theme is the zombies of all flavors are going to be rolled up in 2023.

I know you're putting on a forecast. Nobody's watching. Come on. Yeah. We're continuing to see M&A volume B robust.

Yeah, there's just coming across right now that Blinken. Tony Blinken says that Biden asked him to travel to China early next year. That was really kind of building what we expected coming out of those Asian ping-mee-ding was that Tony Blinken is going to head over to China. What are they going to talk about? And I think this is important. Are they going to talk about the chip sector? Are they going to talk about Taiwan? Are they going to talk about how they deal with Russia? How do you sort of rank your priorities at a time of some pretty serious red lines? But I quote early next year, we will have a much better framework of the slowdown of China or the stability of economic China or the recovery of economic China. Or the reopening of zero COVID. Well, there's a lot of debates out there about China. To me, it's the uncertainty in the next year. There was something that happened overnight.

17599," To me, it's the uncertainty in the next year. There was something that happened overnight. The financial stuff. The PBOC warned that if there was some sort of reopening, it could cause an inflationary push that they weren't expecting. And it's going to affect their easing and how much they're willing to ease. It just speaks to a preparation, gaming out what this looks like is China clearly needs to reopen into the rest of the world. Well, it's going to be fascinating and Elizabeth economy now with the Secretary of Mundo at Commerce has just always said, this is fragile or that's a new word. It's a like it. It's fragile than it looks. Futures deteriorate, negative 1.2 percent on standard employers, negative 47 points of fixed breaks out over 25. Some fragility in the market into that important economic data. We'll see it 830. We look at FTX at 845. Stay with us on Radio and Television. This is Bloomberg. Keeping you up today with news from around the world with the first word, I'm Lisa Mateo. Well, in the Japanese, there will be higher taxes on wages and dividends for the wealthy. And there will be an almost real-term standstill in spending on public services at a time when demand for them is growing. Ukraine's president, Vladimir Zelensky, has laid out his conditions for peace. Zelensky says only the return of territory taken by Russia will allow and enter the war. And that includes Crimea, which was annexed in 2014. Crimea is part of Ukraine. This is not just a state within a state. It's part of our country and part of our sovereignty. And therefore, indeed, the occupation of the Crimea and Donbass will bring the end to the war. Zelensky spoke to the Bloomberg new economy forum in Singapore. More than a week after the elections, Republicans have won a narrow majority in the House that gives them the power to halt President Biden's agenda. Still, their slim margin is a letdown. The party had counted on decisive election results as a springboard for the 2024 presidential race. And Macy has reported third quarter earnings that beat estimates. The department store retailer also raised its full guidance. And that's a sign that it has succeeded in lowering shoppers, despite consumers shifting away from discretionary spending.

17600," is highest ever ranking. So what could be making this over a century year-old fashion house appealing to a new generation of consumers? What Prada has not been adeptly is their overall understanding of how cultural conversations are happening online. Their ability to partner with various cultural figures. Gen Z faces are at the front of Prada's advertising to this new market. Maya Hawk, Hunter Schaefer and Sydney Swini will be familiar to any fans of Stranger Things or Euphoria. There could be another factored play, the environment. Of those surveyed by the Lancet, over 59% of Gen Z said that they were extremely worried about the climate crisis. So for example, the revival of Prada's iconic nylon handbag using eco-friendly materials may be when incudos among these shoppers. Of course, Prada Mew are not inexpensive brands and as the global cost of living crisis hits, these brands might start to feel a pin. But for now, Gen Z seemed to be reaching for their nylon handbags and not letting go. You will shed light on dark matter. You will make aging optional. You will turn 5G up to 11.

I think what Central Banks around the world have clearly recognized is that they need to move in a determined fashion to durably bring inflation down. Gated Gopineth for the International Monetary Fund, not at the spring meetings, not at their annual meeting in Marrakech next year, in Singapore with Bloomberg. Our new economy formed.

Unbelievable. 16,700 down and spiking down, down, down, three, 300 dollars. And that matters. I mean, these little moves matter right now. Yeah, but there's a broader point here, which is that as a combination comes out, what does that mean in terms of who is exposed, right? There is that tweet from Brian Chesky of Airbnb. I miss him. When the lights go on at the end of a nightclub at 2 a.m. You sort of see what's left over and that's what it feels like right now. And how much is that we're going to see? How much more of that is there going to be out there? Very good. Nick Beddenberg joins us right now. He's international economist at Wells Fargo and maybe more than anybody I know. Nails foreign exchange more on a longer term basis as well. Let's dovetail your work over the years with foreign exchange into international economics. Is the study of the dollar is a study of foreign exchange valuable and gaming out international economics right now? Well, yes, I, you know, I actually think maybe the study of international economics is more helpful in terms of the dollar because we definitely seen differences in growth. Europe's already in recession, the United Kingdom, the Eurozone is very, very close to being there. Whereas the US is holding on, you know, pretty well. I think that's going to be sort of more influential in just the relative growth trends helping the dollar for now, but seeing the dollar depreciate later. So the study in, forget about Q4, we're almost through it. The study into next year is a study of what the US will do or is it more centric on what Europe will do, Japan will do, a beleaguered United Kingdom will do. Which side of that trade is the one we should focus on? You know, I think there's always a focus on the United States and, you know, perhaps quite, quite rightly so, the largest financial market, the largest economy in the world. And as you earlier noted, you know, a comment here or there from the Federal Reserve policy makers and we've seen, you know, yields higher and the dollar higher as well. So I think that's where the surprises going to be. We believe that the Federal Reserve funds rate is going to go above 5% up to 5.25. And so I still think it's Federal Reserve monetary policy for now. That's going to drive the dollar a little bit higher and keep those foreign currencies probably on the defensive. Let's talk about some of that monetary policy. Jim Bullard in comments talking about how or not yet restrictive. Also saying this, he states policy rules suggesting rates between 5% and 7%. This is Jim Bullard of the St. Louis Fed moments ago or about a half an hour or 20 minutes ago. How much are we looking at something that is going to cause the dollar to surge to levels that people are not expecting and cause some sort of fissure here that needs a response? Well, I mean, those rules or those targets are, you know, probably a moving point. And I think a 5% level and 7% is a long way. But I think a 5% level is reasonable when you've got these inflation numbers at 7 or 8%. Now I think longer term, you know, maybe in the region of 2 and a half to 3 is kind of more reasonable. But I think in the current context, these very high rates are more than, you know, more than appropriate. I think, you know, from your perspective or the other question part of your question was, will we see the dollar surge to levels that we haven't seen before? I think we'll get back to recent peaks and maybe slightly above. But for now, the dollar's moving higher, but the end of the inflation problem is probably in sight. And so we'll probably get back to recent highs, not go above them. What would a interest rate, a federal funds rate of 7% due to an economy with this much debt? That's the problem. Rambo, we're saying, Nick, I'm sorry. You know, she does this. She goes so far. Well, we're probably, we already think there's going to be a recession. But with the high inflation weighing on purchasing power, these, you know, housing market being affected by these high interest rates. So unfortunately, it would be a deeper recession than what we would expect. But again, not the pandemic and not the global financial crisis. Did you say 7%? That's what he, that's what Jim Bullard of the Federal Reserve of St. Louis said that it could get up to a first that the policy role suggests rates between five. It could be. He might be an agreement because he was someone who got out front, but my question is the issue has been this market has been able to tolerate interest rates well beyond what anybody thought previously were expected. So now we're suddenly readjusting to a normal. Nick, you just, you've done so well over the decades in gaming the markets and particularly your expertise in foreign exchange.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,215,2022-11-17 13:25:44
17602," We're suddenly readjusting to a new normal. Nick, you've just, you've done so well over the decades in gaming the markets and particularly your expertise in foreign exchange. I'm absolutely fascinated by if you think all these fancy people are overcome by events and that if you get 5%, or 6%, or 7%, whatever the nation is, they're overcome by the politics of it, including what we saw in the United Kingdom this morning. Well, I don't know if they're overcome by it, but again I think that we're going back to the levels that we haven't seen in a couple of decades. We've got inflation that we haven't seen in a couple of decades. It's all a moving target and no one really knows where the peak is. What I would say though, and again why we think interest rates don't go to 7, maybe they get to 5, why we think the dollar gets back to its previous peak, is we're starting to see the first encouraging signs on the inflation front. Those supply delivery times are down a lot. The commodity prices are down. Some of the shipping costs are down. So we think there's still some further dollar strength to go. There's still some interest rate increase. But we're pretty heavily focused on sort of the first quarter, second quarter of next year is being the peak and hopefully things will improve from then. Nick, thank you so much. Dick Benhambrick with us with Wells Fargo this morning on International Economics and on a dollar, DXY107, haven't followed against the Bloomberg dollar index this morning, but yeah, and there we were looking at a huge move, 139.0140. Just a churn, I'd say, to foreign exchange lease over the last number of days. It's been a churn with a consensus from an increasing number of people that perhaps the dollar has peaked, right? And if it hasn't peaked, but it's close to it as we were just hearing from Nick, how much is that going to sort of give some sort of bottom, frankly, to where stocks can go? Because that has been one of the big drivers, right? The dollar strengthens and that's been bad. The seller weakens, that's been risk on. How long can we continue that? It's negative 43 dollar futures, negative 323, nastic down 1.2%, the VIX added to 25 level 24.93. Yields move. Another way to put a 369 on the 10 year yield is a higher yield, 3.76%, and on oil, I'm going to call it quiescent. 92 dollars. We owe off a dollar on Brent Crude. The foreign exchange market, you heard Nick Benhambrick talk of resiliency here for a while in US dollar. Dollar stronger today.

Bloomberg surveillance is a way from some prints both with respect to jobless figures as well as housing starts, housing permits to build new construction right now in markets. A bit of a sell-off after some of the comments out of Jim Bullard right now with some of the data starting to trickle out. Let's head over to Bloomberg's Michael McKee. Good morning, Lisa. We're seeing all the data now on the Bloomberg and initial jobless claims look like they have gone down just touch 222,000 from 225,000. We'll see what that previous number was revised to. Continuing claims do continue to rise 1,507,000 up from 1493. So some of the people who are losing jobs are taking longer to find new ones. That's what that's telling us, but it's 222. It's still pretty low in terms of layoffs. The layoffs going on at Twitter and other places in the tech industry not really having a major effect on the national numbers. Housing starts are up for the month 1,425,000. That is an increase of 4.2% over the revised September estimate. It's 8.8% below where it was a year ago. However, building permits are a little bit lower, 1,526 from 1,564. That's a 2.4% drop and it's 10% below where they were a year ago. Now that's not going to surprise anybody. Housing numbers have not been good. Philadelphia Fed puts out its index and maybe this is the more interesting number of the day. The Philadelphia Fed index drops significantly to 19.4 from negative 8.7. So a significant drop there, suggesting business really, really slowed in the first part of November and of October. And the prices paid index falls to 35 from 35.3 from 36.3. So still some progress being made on prices there. Employment is way down 7.1 versus 28.5. Now these regional Fed indexes don't necessarily tell you national trends but when you get them all out and add them together, it does suggest where we might be going in terms of things like the ISM number which will get the first of December. Michael, let you parse through some of the details. Just want to bring to you with the market steering which isn't that much if you want to take it be honest.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,217,2022-11-17 13:34:18
17604," going in terms of things like the ISM number, which will get the first of December. Michael, let's you parse through some of the details. Just want to bring to you what the market's doing, which isn't that much if you want to take it, if you're honest. You're seeing yields come off just a touch and you're seeing equity is pretty much stay around those lows and futures. What I'm looking at right now, Tom, is a story that stays pretty much the same. We see housing, having issues, definitely just here reading the jobs picture. Still pretty strong. The idea that you're not seeing that pop-up in jobless claims that you'd be expecting, which really raises a question of how far the federal have to go. Michael McKee, my tweet of the day yesterday was Jason Furman of Harvard. He teaches a small course called Act 10, retweeted by the laureate Paul Krugman, over how rents fold into all the Michael McKee analysis. And the answer is you've got a bigger number of core inflation based on older locked-in leases, but when you use the spot rent market, core inflation cascades down to a more gentle 2.8%. It's discussed that, Mike. Is that a valid study? Definitely a valid study, and it's something that a lot of people have been talking about. The way the government computes the CPI, they take not just new rents, but existing rents. And those aren't going to change because they're already in place. Now, the Zillow numbers, which Jason Furman was talking about, and there's also another private one out there. Those look at new rents only. And if you look at new rents only, then rent prices are dropping significantly. Rent's been the biggest driver in the CPI. So the question becomes for the Fed, do you pay attention to what's in the CPI and to a lesser extent in the PCE? Because you know that those prices are going to go down. It's just a question of time. It's actually happening right now, but it won't be reflected in the data for a couple of months. And I think the Fed is probably looking beyond some of those housing costs in CPI, seeing this other private data come in and seeing that it is suggesting that housing inflation is going to go down. Michael McKay, thank you so much for bringing this all down. We'll catch up with you later in the morning as well. Joining us now, nobody better to speak about what we saw over the United Kingdom, as well as the potential agony over lag effects. How to understand them, John Riding, Chief Economic Advisor, Breene Capital, former Economic Advisor to the Bank of England. On this Thursday, John, when you take a look at some of this data, which isn't softening quickly enough, and you hear the hardline talk from the Fed to reserve, what's your sense about how far behind we are in terms of lag effects, and we'll actually see the ramifications? Well, Lisa, as you know, we had many discussions last year where I said that inflation was not transitory, was going to be a real problem, you know, and it still is. And I mean, interestingly enough, in the numbers that Mike went over, you know, he didn't mention the prices paid, prices received data by manufacturing firms in the Philadelphia region, which, like in the New York region, went up to 34 and changed from about 31. So we're far from having defeated inflation at this point. And I would also take a little bit of issue on the rent story for two reasons, one of which is rents in the CPI are rising roughly in line with the overall CPI. So they're neither adding nor subtracting to the overall rate of inflation, where people, paying for housing, paying for food, paying for energy are really important in forming people's inflation expectations. So the fact that new rents are declining when people are paying the higher level of existing rents, I don't think it's inappropriate, but this idea that we always take out the bits that are pushing up inflation and looking at inflation, excluding that, you know, I find a, you know, a bit problematic because it never, policymakers never do it the other way. Okay, this is really important because there are all these people coming out there and this is the biggest pushback and the reason why we've gotten lifts and markets. People say they're disinflationary elements and you point it to the rent story, you point to the used cars, you push back and you say that those are completely offset and then some by the other indicators, is that right? Well, yes, I mean, we've had, and I actually think fed policymakers are somewhat on top of this. We've had three times this year, three months of the 10 months which had CPI data were the so-called core excluding food and energy only went up by three tenths of a percent and it was then followed by inflation.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,218,2022-11-17 13:38:43
17605," three months of the 10 months which had CPI data were the so-called core excluding food and energy only went up by three tenths of a percent and it was then followed by inflation picking up again. So yes one one report where you got an odd treatment from healthcare costs. Health insurance costs fell 4% in the CPI. Now I'd love to have that health insurance policy and I'm sure most people like they would love to have that but I don't think anybody's health insurance costs fell by 4%. But my point is inflation is the overall price index and you can pick and choose and take this number out and take that number out. But the reality is inflation both here and globally is a problem and central banks have created or at least made the problem worse by staying too easy for too long after the pandemic and that liquidity and that stimulus has to be so good. Now just one second, if I may. There is a communication issue going on at the Fed. I further change in communication and say look there's three things about policy. How fast are we going to raise rates and if clearly signal they're going to slow the pace of increases and the market's got that story right. Then how high are we going to raise rates to and then how long are we going to keep in there and I think the market's got the how fast rate. It's slowing but I still think we're offside on how high and how long rates are going to stay. The markets are pricing in barely reaching 5% on the Fed funds rate and then the Fed quickly cutting rates there after. I'm amazed by that conversation. Absolutely. I totally agree. I'm amazed by the certitude that they're going to do a pivot or whatever you want to call it. This is an historic day. The chancellor of the exchequer stood up and said we have austerity. You and I read Paul Johnson 1987 the English disease. It was a beautiful essay about the struggles of Clement Attlee Churchill and the rest coming forward. What is the level of crisis in your United Kingdom right now? Is it something that's solvable? Is it a two-year recession as Bailey talks about or is it an English disease that is larger? I think that's a very difficult question to answer. I think that the finances of the economy prospectively going forward are in better shape now than they were prospectively with the budget. The mini budget was put forward in September that helped spark the whole crisis in the guilt's market. But the UK is still struggling with Brexit and struggling with a lot of struggling with inflation issues and the bank of England. I don't think it has raised rates quickly enough or early enough to get on top of that. But now with this very interesting question, I think the US may be facing it. Can policymakers raise rates enough? Time policy enough to get inflation under control without sparking a significant financial crisis? Well, is the Phillips Curve operative right now in the financial stability John Williams talked about yesterday? Are these traditional theories operative right now? Well, I think the Phillips Curve hasn't been operative since the late 1960s and I think it is very interesting that the very flat Phillips Curve, the policy, they don't have to keep pushing an employment down without raising inflation, comes back as something that's going to cure the inflation problem. The main thing about inflation is expectations and having people and companies understand that higher inflation isn't going to be laden. What we have in, for example, in this Philadelphia Fed report here, so it is, company cost increases slowing, but the price increases not slowing. Now, yes, the October numbers were a little bit encouraging, probably most in the PPI, but there's a big difference between inflation having peak levels. We never thought we're going to get to and getting back to price stability. So, quickly, John, from a Christmas tree farm north says, ask him about England US in the World Cup. And Nemesis team, we lost one nothing to the US in 1950 and the first World Cup in England played in and then back in 2010, we tied one one day after Thanksgiving.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,219,2022-11-17 13:42:54

I'm shocked, John. Right, thank you, son. Thank you. I think John Ferrell's going with England as well. That means you and I must go with the U.S. Clearly, obviously. Let's, I don't know if he is going with the UK, let's see. After Ryan's bills, we'll be able to watch England, U.S. Coming up, Katie Grifeld and Bitcoin.

It's a power shift in Washington, although not as big as Republicans in hope for. The GOP has won a narrow majority of the House that gives him the ability to block President Biden's agenda. House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy tweeted that Americans are ready for a new direction and Republicans are ready to deliver. Democrats had controlled the House the last four years. A senior IMF official says it will take some time for the full extent of this year's interest rate hikes to become apparent. The US Secretary of State, Gita Gopinath, also looked at what comes next for the Federal Reserve. They are very likely to raise interest rates another round before the end of this year. And then the question is, what comes next? And I think 2023 is, for 2023, the question is more about how long are you going to keep these rates at the levels that they've moved them to? Gopin asked the Pope at the Bloomberg Academy for him in Singapore. In China, COVID restrictions are still impacting consumer sentiment.

We were constantly hustling behind him as he caught up with executives in the portfolio companies and reminisce with former and current players. He's a day trader himself, self-made day trader. And so he's on the bus after a game in New England and he's day trading on the bus and Bill and Bill checks season and cuts him on the spot. In many ways it's convention, right? The people that I don't see maybe once a year and so it's kind of all come together. My firm, our charity, fundraising efforts and then the friends that are around. My dad and my brother, it's all happens right there as a confluence of all these parts of my life that have found its common center. The multi-trillion dollar industry, there's a lot of ground to cover. Come on, he's got absolutely crushed. We'll show you what's happening in ETFs like no one else. Bloomberg ETF IQ Monday on Bloomberg. In the area of stablecoins that it would be important for Congress to step in and say you're not permitted to offer a stablecoin unless it's done under a strong credential framework with Federal Reserve, Oversight, Supervision, Regulation and Approval. Michael Barr, the vice chair for Supervision at the Federal Reserve System, they're talking about stablecoin use. Only stablecoin I know is when somebody has a full-time job in the house, but there we are, Mr. Barr, talking about the upset of the moment. Welcome to Bloomberg's surveillance crypto. We do this with Katie Griefeld and they got a number of ways to go. Let's bring up the chart of Bitcoin right now and what you need to know, it's a series of lower highs since November 14th and is rolled over ever so slightly in the last hour down 62 dollars under 16,500. When all of these players look at the price of Bitcoin, how does that correlate to their future? How are they linked to the price of Bitcoin? FTX, Mr. Silbert of, is it DGC or DCG? See, I got it. Whatever you said, I agree. But how is it linked to the price of Bitcoin? Well, if you go to SBF's tweets, there's a lot of letters here. If you go to Sang Bankman Freed's tweets, basically he said that FTX was over their skis on leverage. Maybe that's not such a horrible thing or it's less bad when the line is going up, but that chart's amazing because it just shows like you said, this grind lower, this continued step down and now we're setting it 16,000 on Bitcoin. It's a lot easier to sort of cover up brewing ills in a bull market when the lines are going up. Obviously, that's not happening anymore. You and your colleagues published on Mr. Silbert last night. This is really important folks. This guy is not SBK. He's not dashing around talking to Tom Brady. This gentleman from Connecticut out of Emory University and all of a sudden, Barry Silbert's called into question. What do you mean by that? Well, think about what happened at Genesis. So DCG, that is the parent company. It's one of the biggest most important empires in crypto that isn't really talked about much in mainstream media because unlike SBF, unlike CZ over at Binance. See, I'm actually just insulted me calling me mainstream media. What's continuing? I've spent too much time on Twitter. I'm sorry, but basically.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,221,2022-11-17 13:51:40
17608," unlike SPF, unlike CZ over it by now she just insulted me calling me mainstream media. Let's continue. I've spent too much time on Twitter. I'm sorry, but basically silver controls what was a 10 billion dollar crypto empire? They raised money at that valuation just last year, but yesterday sort of the crown jewel in the empire that's Genesis. It's a crypto lender. It's suspended with draws with you. You expect news from Genesis this morning. I mean, all the focus the media focus is on is it SBK? SPF. SPF. Okay, that's a publishing company out of Los Angeles. Excuse me. All the focus is on the guy going into bankruptcy. Are we wrong? Should we focus on Mr. Silver and do you expect news there today following on the shock of yesterday? I think there's a lot of really deserved attention paid on SPF. Just the unravel has been fantastic, but it is really important to watch the follow on the news. I'm not sure if you're going to be able to see what's going on here. Watch big lenders such as Genesis. If you would ask me two weeks ago, would I expect me? Yesterday, I probably would have said no, but given how fast everything is moving, it's something to watch for. Bloomberg has reported that Genesis has hired advisors to look at options here. We don't know specifically what those options are, but they've hired people to that effect. Unfair question, but it's unfair Thursday. Fossils like me and the ever young Liz and Saunders all say, why hasn't Bitcoin gone more? I didn't respond to that. No, Tom, it's great. It's a great question. Stay with me on this. Why is Bitcoin not trading at you name the price? Actually, tweeted to that effect yesterday and the tweak got 2000 likes. Why isn't Bitcoin lower? When you consider the just two weeks that we've lived through and the fact that we're still at $16,000. It's not $69,000 where we were a year ago, but there is this resilience sort of built into the market. Even today, Bitcoin is a market. Is it a market? That's the key question. Is it? Is it? Yeah, she looked at me on radio folks. She's looking at me like, what do you mean it's not a market? Come on, the regulators like Michael Barr saying we don't aren't sure this is a market. So it's gone 60,000 to 16,000. How does it get down lower other than one of these elephants just saying go to cash? Well, that's what's that's who's left. It's those elephants. It's those whales. That's the answer. I keep getting when I ask people how is in Bitcoin falling? Right. Everyone who would have sold has already sold. And all you're left with is these big accumulators, sort of these big hardcore believers who aren't going to sell at this point. I mean, maybe they bought into Bitcoin when it was $7 or it's these big institutional players. And until you see one of those chips fall, I mean, you're pretty much out of floor. Rachel from West Lafayette emails in. She wants to be a Purdue University. And Rachel asked, what about the Winkle Vi? I mean, that's all anybody knows. People like me, Dom, we focus on the Winkle Vi and they're linked in to Genesis, right? Mr. Silver? They are. So that was, again, one of the ripple effects from FTX through Genesis into Gemini. There's a lot of letters. There's a lot of G names too, something to think about. But it's the Winkle Vi twins yesterday. They had this product on their platform, Gemini, called Gemini Earn, which basically. I can't buy. Now you're going to be going. But that was their problem. And this is family television. Because their big problem was that they're one of their huge counterparties with Genesis. As far as we know, the site's up and running. But that's again. I'm going to talk like not me and not me, folks, but this is the critics out there, including NeuroRubini. If you give me your money, we can monetize Bitcoin and make 8% or 10%. That's the game, right? Yes. How do you regulate that? I mean, some, not me, but others would say scam. Those of us who are in the business. Those of us who are in the business, not me, but others would say scam. Those of a certain vintage would say executive life, 1970, whatever, 14% of newities. What's the difference here? I'm going to make 10% on BitDog. Well, again, when you strip it down the way you just did, it sort of exposes it as lending money in a circle. I would understand how that's hard to regulate. I'm not a regular. Call that the American government continue. But again, it gets back to the market. It works when money is a circle when you are looking at an 80% drawdown in a year and just the price of Bitcoin, there's other smaller coins that are down much more dramatically than that. That gets harder to do. Those return...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,222,2022-11-17 13:56:27
17609," It an 80% drawdown in a year and just the price of Bitcoin. There's other smaller coins that are down much more dramatically than that. That gets harder to do. Those returns just aren't there. You're hit with the liquidity issues that we're seeing rippling through the space right now. Unfair question. Let's finish with this. Katie Greiffel, 16,470. Where in your head is a tip point, a dispersion point where this unravels? Is it 15? Is it nine? Is it 12? Do you have a number in your head or are experts having their head? I don't have a number. I would say when we get to the single digits or below that 10k level, maybe that's where it gets interesting. Because this market loves big round numbers for better or worse. There seems to be so important. I don't know. Stop set up there when I talk to people. So we'll see. But as I said, it's you would have thought it would be down a lot more. Did I do okay there? That was good. I think you don't have that. When you're on to get so much hate mail. It's like you know. I mean, Ferrell gets all these love notes and I get nothing every time you're on. I get absolutely crushed. Are you publishing today seriously, Mr. Silver? My boss would certainly hope so. Okay. Well, you know, well, you know, slide it out to an eight hour workday from six hours. Katie Greiffel, they're on all that's going on in this. And we'll continue to follow this. I really want to commend on radio, Paul Sweeney and Matthew Miller and the 10 o'clock hour with some solid knowledge on all this for people like me, distant and removed from this. I learn every time they open their mouths and it gets crypto show. Did they get the Tuesday on the crypto show? Yeah, that was two side. I mean, they got another one coming up next Tuesday. Yeah, we got to wait all the way till then. Well, you should do one every day. The way this is going 16,462. The markets have deteriorated through the morning SPX negative 52, the VIX 25.12. Please stay with us. This is Bloomberg. Good morning. Well, Tesla's in the like make for good headlines. The reality is that even if every car on the roads today won electric, it wouldn't be enough to curb global emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change. greenhouse gas emissions from transportation account for about 29% of total US greenhouse gas emissions. So what about the other 71% building across America burned fossil fuels to operate? What we want to do is make that all electric. Instead of burning oil and gas to give us the energy and electricity we need, we want to do 100% clean energy, all electric. We want to turn buildings into Tesla's. Just like a Tesla or an electric vehicle is all electric with no fossil fuels. We want to do that with our buildings. If we can do it in one building, we can do it in all buildings. And if we do it in all buildings, we'll reduce 30% of US greenhouse gas emissions. Welcome to the world of decentralized finance. I'm going to take a look right here at regulation. We are seeing digital currencies under some pressure. Bloomberg's covering all things crypto of people. I want to have some of my money outside of the solder. The transactions. It all comes down to the details here. And the technology. How does that affect disruptions?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,223,2022-11-17 14:00:36
17610, But people I want to have some of my money outside of the solder the transactions it all comes down to the details here and the technology how does that affect disruptors like you what happens to everything that you're investing in when the last Bitcoin is mine. Here from leading economists policy makers and industry experts be alive and on-demand webinars only from Bloomberg start exploring to see what's moving the markets. Everything you need to get set for the start of US training. This is Bloomberg the Open with Jonathan Farrow. The key issue at the moment is the sequencing. We're going to see the growth slowdown. If you asked us three months ago we would have thought it was Q1 to Q3. You won't really see the full effect of this tightening probably until possibly even the midpoint of next year. Now it's looking more like a Q2 to Q4 maybe even as late as Q1 to 2024. There are significant lags to Fed policy. You're going to see a big lag. That's going to be a bigger problem. The lags between monetary policy tightening and the effect in the real economy. The investable windows are really short. There's not a time to get too cute. It's the window between hey inflation looks like it's peak. We have seen now inflation come down and the unemployment rate is rising and other forms of economic growth are slowing. That's a lot of gloom. Joining us now to parse through what it means is JPMorgan's Tom Kennedy and Samir Samana of Wells Fargo really in pivotal moment with two amazing people to really discuss this. I want to start with you Tom. With all of your experience and the Federal Reserve how much are you looking at a lag time? What kind of delay are we looking for this growth shock? Good morning Lisa. Yeah the lag defect is getting a lot of attention. I think we have to take the big zoom out. The Fed really only started tightening conditions nine months ago and it's going to take some time. The classical progression of the lead lag so tightening of conditions and what it would mean for the economy. The housing sector is the first place you're going to see it show up and unfortunately that sector is in a recession already. Housing starts down 20 plus percent from the peak. Mortgage applications are 2011 all over again. So you're getting the desired impacts there. The next phase as it moves into corporates that's only just begun. So in our base case it's likely you're going to end up seeing unemployment start to take up in Q2 and recession time most likely should have come middle of next year. JPMorgan's Michael Ferroly is projecting that that mild recession in the United States. Last year I read in quote the almost 500 basis points of expected cumulative hikes is already delivering a commensurate tightening of financial conditions which we believe will tip the economy into mild recession later next year talking about how firms are hoarding labor and the economy could still shed over a million jobs. Samar from your perspective how much of this has already been priced into the equity markets. That's a great question Lisa. It's probably a key question. I was hearing the kind of comments from a previous speaker about the lags and the economic activity. I was thinking about the lead that the markets tend to have right when you look at crypto when you look at equities being down this year despite earnings growth being positive to me the markets are running well ahead of it.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,224,2022-11-17 14:04:44
17611," about the lead that the markets tend to have, right? When you look at crypto, when you look at equities being down this year despite earnings growth being positive, to me, you know, the markets are running well ahead of it. And so if the economy kind of troughs out in the second to third quarter of next year, there's a pretty good chance that the equity markets, another risk mark gets reported trough in the first quarter of next year. Well, and this is the issue is that we're waiting for something to drop. And Tommy, yesterday we heard from a number of Fed speakers, including John Williams of the New York Fed, talking about how you are going to see some problems and that that is not the mandate of central bank policy. They want to go to fight inflation, not necessarily to dampen any potential risk in markets from your perspective. What kind of shoe could we see drop? What kind of financial stability risks could we likely see coming from here? Yeah, I think the broad conclusion from this round of central bank speak is the Fed is not ready to get off the financial conditions merry-go-round. If you will, they haven't seen enough growth impact, even though we're all expecting that deterioration. And inflation still remains too high. So they have to see that growth deterioration. They also will need to see some more of these desired impacts on inflation. Inflation needs to come down to get rid of that entrenchment risk that Chair Powell has been talking about a lot. But along the way, Lisa, I think of it as central bank when policy is this tight, they're shaking that global tree, that global, the global economy is being shaken by the Fed and who knew that the UK pension system had leverage in it. The crypto system, surely we knew, had some leverage, but didn't see where it was. These are the apples that are falling. I mean, it's hard to know what these things are in real time. And we all think about them regularly, but this is a consequence of this situation. And I don't really spend too much time trying to figure out exactly what it would be, mostly because the Fed has two priorities ahead of it, which is getting the desired effects on growth and inflation coming down. Samir, how do you, when you're picking certain stocks, figure out whether something is a bubble that is already bursted or something that is still vulnerable to some of these sort of systemic shocks that may be out there, those apples that could fall to use town's words? Yeah, so we started a lot of this process late last year from the standpoint of going up in market cap, going up in quality. We didn't know exactly what was going to transpire this year from a Fed policy standpoint, but valuations are well ahead of what history would tell you, would be anywhere close to fair. And now, I think you're starting to see the opposite, right? When you look at vulnerable areas like small caps, looking for vulnerable areas like emerging markets, they are cheaper. Now, again, it's still probably much too soon to kind of step into those areas. We're still unfavorable in smalls. We're still unfavorable in emerging markets. We're still most unfavorable in developed markets. But that's what we'll be looking for. Is valuations probably will get there before some of these other things start to turn. So I think that's probably what our eyes are trained to. There's not so much what the Fed's doing, not to take anything away from what they're trying to do now. But unfortunately, this Fed will always have the label of being the transitory Fed. And so they'll probably be late to declare an end to inflation and late to pivot. Markets will probably get there before and valuations will be the key. And this is the issue that a lot of people have been basically looking at the Fed's peak. And there is a lot of it. And shrugging off the hawkish calls and looking at the dovish ones to sort of sniff out that pivot before the Fed itself. Let's talk about that chorus of Fed officials voicing their support for a slower pace of rate hikes. Governor Chris Waller becoming the latest to throw his weight behind a downshift. Looking forward to the FOMC's December meeting, the data of the past few weeks have made me more comfortable considering stepping down to a 50 basis point hike. That sounds good. That sounds bullish at least for some looking for a pivot. But it isn't necessarily at all when you take a look some of the other Fed speak. Blue Works Michael Baki joining us now. Yeah, Lisa, Chris Waller made some news overnight and it was affecting markets. And then his St. Louis buddy Jim Bullard came out this morning and said, hold my beer. Jim Bullard saying, we are going to have to go much higher than we thought we would have to go. Even under the generous assumptions he said that people are looking at. They're not in his own that's restrictive yet. That they've got to increase the terminal rate further. And further means a lot further than Wall Street's thinking about. Under an optimistic scenario, he says we could get to 5%. Under a pessimistic scenario, 7%. And that's what has.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,225,2022-11-17 14:09:12
17612," It's thinking about under an optimistic scenario. He says we could get to 5%, under a pessimistic scenario, 7%. And that's what has everybody on Wall Street running for their lunch buckets this morning, is they are a little afraid that maybe he could turn out to be right. And it is not what the market has been expecting. You look at what's been priced in and they're looking at the step down. You can see there at a 50 basis points in December, then step down to 25 basis points. And then in May of next year, you start cutting rates according to the futures market, 25 basis points at a time, into 2024. The Fed is trying to push back against that, it appears. Not only those who say we could step down to 50, they're also saying that they are not done yet. Nobody's put a number on it like Jim Bullard. Just the data to watch as we go forward, keep an eye on the PCE index that comes out at the end of the month, the sequential month to month. As you can see, we saw big decline and then it went up the last two months. And that's not what the Fed wants to see. It wants to see continued drops. CPI, the increased spell, let's see if that happens with PCE. You can see just a little bit of improvement. Well, it's kind of a weird way to put it at least. It's kind of a good improvement in unemployment because it goes up a little bit, but unemployment is going to have to rise some for the Fed to get where it wants to go. We don't know how much it would have to rise to get to 7 percent though. It's a weird year to talk about economics and talk about the good news and bad news and all of this stuff. Michael McKee, thank you so much. I want to sit on that one point. Jim Bullard talking about potentially a 7 percent Fed funds rate. Tom Kennedy, Simear Svana, both with us, Tom, from your perspective, is this plausible, a 7 percent Fed funds rate? It's certainly plausible. I think that's in the entrenched inflation scenario where the behavioral mindset of inflation changes. And this is what Volker broke many decades ago. If that happens, you have, and it's art. It's not science to this, but the longer inflation stays high, that possibility remains. And that wouldn't necessitate a much deeper recession. And I think that's the scenario where you can get towards 7 percent. I think what's really challenging, in my view, to get there is inflation is rolling over. We are finally seeing the disinflationary pressures from supply chain confusion, if you will. Inventories are building. And you can look no further than a PPI, which has been slowing for many months now. And from there, you have to say, well, how low can inflation really go? And what is the level of inflation the Fed is fighting? And to me, I think you have to look at the wage market there. And that's sending you a signal that trend core inflation is something like 4, 4 and a half percent. So hiking to 5 percent, which Lisa is already in the price, should be sufficient to cool that type of inflation, assuming you can keep inflation expectations anchored. And Samir, and I want to build on that just coming up later this hour, but Samir, from your perspective, does this feel plausible? A 7 percent sort of bear case that could actually not be that unrealistic? We don't think so. We think it's more theoretical than anything. I mean, come on, there's going to be a lot of damage on the way the 7 percent. And unfortunately, the Fed's just not going to be able to stick to it. So I take something away from the theory. But we've tried average inflation targeting. We've tried things like modern monetary policy theory over the last few years. There's just been so much that we've tried. This may yet be another experiment. But when you think of as a pragmatist, to Tom's point, inflation is coming down. When you look at market-based expectations, those are fairly low. Even the University of Michigan, right? I mean, you're only talking about 2.9 to 3 percent for consumers in terms of what they're expecting. So again, you just don't need a 7 percent Fed funds in that type of environment going forward. We're going to build this. Tom Kennedy, Samir, Samana, both of you are sticking with us. Let's get a look at some of the stocks moving ahead of the opening bell. Abigail, do you have those? Abby. Hey, Lisa, what we do, of course, have the major indexes down where they've won percent. But before going at what, look, taking a look at what's dragging, let's look at what's working. And that, of course, are some of the retail stores. So the mixed signals that we have in retail continue, may sees up 7.5 percent. They put in a monster beat, 52 cents, more than double the estimate of 19 cents. It seems that the company's been able to lure customers in even with the slowing discretionary spending that we've seen out of other notable retailers, such as Target. The fact that body works up 17.5 percent.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,226,2022-11-17 14:13:27
17613," The company has been able to lure customers in even with the slowing discretionary spending that we've seen out of other notable retailers such as Target. Bath and body works up 17.4% a similar story, a huge beat. They boosted their profit outlook as well. It seems as though a good mix of products new and old is really helping out that retailer. As for what is weighing this morning and creating those big losses for the major average is Apple down 1.8%. This of course is yields are higher on this hawkish fed speak out there really making tech look more expensive, less attractive. Ali Baba down 2.5% not just on the rising yields but they also put up disappointing quarter missing revenues. JP Morgan Chase, this is a conundrum of the year lease and we of course have yields higher but that's not helping out banks and oil is lower and that is weighing on ex-Unmobile. So overall right now we are looking at a down day. In fact two down days perhaps the worst since the beginning of November. Thank you so much Abby. It's really interesting in the face of a deeply inverted yield curve coming up the UK unveiling billions in tax increases and spending cuts. The day we deliver a plan to tackle the cost of living crisis and rebuild our economy. A consolidation of 55 billion pounds and means inflation and interest rates end up significantly lower. We achieve this Mr Speaker in a balanced way. That conversation coming up next we do see futures lower as investors parse through some feds. The 1.3% decline on the S&P. Okay this is one part. Big expensive cities have a lot going for them. But if you live in one you probably notice that these big expensive cities keep getting more well expensive. You could always move away. Well what if someone paid you 10 grand to do it? What if they threw in free office space, a bicycle or a gym membership? Programs and cities and states around the US are doing exactly that and they are getting a lot of interest. So are these nascent programs actually beneficial to their communities and the workers joining them? Or are they little more than flashy advertising campaigns for places looking for an injection of fresh talent? We're in the early stages of a sustainability revolution that has the magnitude of the industrial revolution coupled with the speed of the digital revolution. Nobody covers climate change like Bloomberg, your global business authority. Today we deliver a plan to tackle the cost of living crisis and rebuild our economy. The first difficult decision I take on tax is to reduce the threshold at which the 45 per rate becomes payable from £150,000 to £125,140. We will increase the energy profits levy from 25 to 35%.

17614," Hacks and just over half from spending. This is a balanced plan for stability. Operation regaining a fiscal credibility by the UK government. Chancellor Germian Hunt unveiling billions of spending cuts and tax increases with inflation hitting 41-year highs in the U.S. to split Congress forming a policy gridlock in a lame duck session. It is a fissure. One party Democrat rule in Washington is finished. I have a plea for the Republicans and advice. If you embrace MAGA, you're going to keep losing. We will use the power of the purse. The size of our debt has got to stop. We're not going to have to get everything we want. They're not going to get everything they want. You've got to make an economy that's strong. They're hurting because of inflation. When we come back in January, hopefully after a productive lame duck session, we welcome you to work with us on a bipartisan basis to get things done for the American people. Our team coverage on both sides of the Atlantic starts right now. Guy Johnson and London, Emily Wilkins in Washington Guide, just how austere was this fiscal austerity that we heard today in the autumnal release? Lisa, we got pretty much what the market expected, but I don't think that disguises the brutality of what we're getting here. This is a £55 billion fiscal consolidation into an economy that is already in recession. The chancellor talked about that today. It is absolutely brutal. The question is, does it go too far? You talked about the need to regain fiscal credibility following quasi-quartank's mini-budget. Yes, that certainly needed to be achieved, but does that go? Does what we saw today go above and beyond? We are going to see a 7% fall in real incomes in the UK over the next two years. We're going back to 2013 levels on that. This is going to be absolutely brutal for the UK. I heard one commentator talking about this earlier, talking about two years of hell. It is going to be a very difficult time for the UK. Yes, credibility needed to be restored. Yes, inflation needs to come down, but does this go too far? Will this hit growth too hard? And ultimately, will the market have a problem with that, Lisa? Arguably, the UK is ahead of the US in terms of when the recession starts. Emily, from the US vantage point, what does fiscal austerity look like with gridlock and DC? At this point with gridlock and DC, it is going to be a lot of looking at the Biden administration to see any sort of action occur through executive actions or what the president can do, because we're just not expecting that much from Congress in the next two years now. Now, of course, Congress does have some must-pass spending bills. They have to fund the government. They have to raise that debt limit. But those are going to become much more difficult battles. Now that you are seeing a very narrow majority for Republicans in the House, it means that only a handful of members can really stime the process, unless, of course, they can get Democrats on board. And so, it's best the next two years to be very interesting ones, but perhaps not the most productive from a standpoint of the number of bills passed and the number of major pieces of legislation enacted. Emily Wilkins in Washington, DC, Guy Johnson in London, both of you, thank you. The prospect of not getting things done, looms a large for a market that is heading into recession by many accounts. And this raises some concerns for a lot of people about what the counterbalance will be to set downturn and what that means. So, with us, Samir Samana, as well as Tom Kennedy of JP Morgan, Samir Samana of Wells Fargo, Samir, I want to start with you in terms of what you expect the consequences to be of the lack of fiscal response to any downturn. Has that been thought through some of the stock valuations? Probably not. You know, I mean, that's one of the things that we've been saying for some time, is that even though you've seen re-rating in multiples for a lot of equities, you probably haven't seen a full realization of how much earnings will fall next year. I mean, consensus still sits somewhere between two, 20 and 230 for the S&T, where I run 205. And we think that's the next year to drop for markets. What about you, Tom? How do you factor that in, especially as you talk about rates that perhaps are not yet restrictive and could be a lot more restrictive than we think now? I think when you look at what's happening in Europe and the UK, the UK is especially important cautionary tale for what's happening in America. The UK is experiencing a terms of trade shock, like nothing we've seen in many decades. The UK imports more than it exports, and it imports mostly energy and food. And",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,228,2022-11-17 14:22:09
17615," Shock like nothing we've seen in many decades. The UK imports more than it exports and it imports mostly energy and food and it has a fiscal deficit that needs to be funded by external folks. This is an unfortunate reality of this situation where when inflation spikes you need to de-lever and cause more pain. I like your point, though, Lisa, what is in the price is what's most important. The cleanest cut I can see in Samir, maybe you want to comment on this, too. When I look at European equities and aggregate, they trade at about a 30% discount to the US. And that's about the same discount you saw during the great financial crisis. The next question for folks like myself, Samir, is that enough in this scenario? And Samir, I'm really with you here. I don't think it's enough with the type of shock that we may see if you need to turn energy off from the industrial sector and reallocate towards citizens just to heat their homes. This potentially a more painful economic outlet than what's in the price. For Europe, you're saying in particular, Tom, right? Correct. Samir, you want to weigh in? No, I would agree with Tom. It's structural issues. These aren't cyclical headlines. These are structural issues. Whether it's Japan, whether it's the UK, whether it's Europe, they're less energy independent and so as Tom's point, they're kind of at the whims of energy markets. And I think one of the big things probably for the coming decades is trying to secure energy supplies so that you can have industry not on the whims of geopolitics. And I think that's going to be one of those things that, you know, to Tom's point, probably keeps those multiples a lot lower than people anticipate. So it's cheap, but it's probably cheaper or reason. Tom, before we let you go, or both of you go, I have to double beds down on that 7% figure of where the Fed funds rate could theoretically go. What probability do you assign us getting to that level at this point? 15%, we do not assign a very similar to what Samir was saying before. This is a possibility, but it's predicated on an event that is behavioral and nearly impossible to model. When I look at what's in the price, I think the Fed is slowing the pace of rate hikes. Maybe they're concerned on the margin about financial stability, but in reality, I think they're slowing the pace because they're getting close to where they want to be and they think that's the level that will be sufficient to cause growth to come down and to actually get inflation down to the level where they'd like to be. Again, I anchor on to the wage growth implications for inflation relative to where the Fed funds rate would be. And in that dynamically said, what's in the price is enough to cause a recession. I actually feel to avoid a recession, the Fed will have to back off much quicker than what's in the price. All right. Well, there's a lot to extrapolate. Hopefully we can in the weeks and months to come, Tom Kennedy and Samir Samana. Thank you both of you for some really incredible talking points and just thought provoking issues here. Coming up, the morning calls later, Black Rocks can't more seeing more room for earnings expectations to come down more on that around the opening bell.

We want someone to put electricity on their grid from a fusion power station as quickly as possible. Frankly the scale of the challenge, 3000 gigawatts of fossil fuel to replace. There's not many things they can do that. In fact there may only be fusion that can really do that. And while many in the scientific community predict fusion power will take decades some in the private fusion space believe we'll get there in just a few years as soon as the 2030s.

We sent it the day without direction. We have found direction. It is down. We're seeing the S&P down 1.4%. The Nasdaq down even more. Why? We are looking to the bond market. We are looking to Fed speak. We heard from Jim Bullard calling for possibly a Fed funds rate of 5 to 7%. Saying that rates were not yet restrictive. And what we're seeing is that yield curve inversion continuing. 67 basis points of inversion. Really interesting to take a look at how people are gaming out a recession in the future. Time now for our morning calls. Look at some of the analyst recommendations I've lost through this morning. First up, Credit Suisse hitting Norwegian crews with a double downgrade. Cutting shares to on-to-perform from an outperform due to downside risk to earnings estimates. Next up, City Group downgrading advanced to auto parts to neutral. Seeing little upside with a lack of catalysts ahead. And finally, going to bang downgrading target to hold expecting higher prices to continue weighing on margins. Coming up, revenue missed out misses. We're seeing outsized reaction in markets. We're speaking with BlackRock's Kate Moore. This is Chermouth. Nutri-Genomics and Precision Nutrition is one of those rare scientific fields that overlaps with the Instagram-friendly wellness industry.

You can go on Google and type personalized nutrition or diet and genes and you will find dozens of different companies that offer this nutrition precision tests. One of those companies is Routine. Some claim that their personalized tests stemming from sciences like Nutri-Genomics make their supplements different. But even with the claims from Routine as well as dozens of other personalized nutrition companies, the science still has a long way to go. Welcome to the world of decentralized finance.

Just moments away from the opening bell. It is a soggy morning. We're trenching some of the gains that we saw last week. This is a year and a half. The need to go further. We're not restrictive enough. Those are the words of Jim Bullard of the St. Louis Federal Reserve at 10 year yield up 3.757 is where we are right now in terms of that 10 year yield to your yield up much more. And you are seeing dollar strength come back in. It is a $1037 on the euro dollar. A little bit lower perhaps the prospect of recession going forward in the face of some of the rate hikes that might need to be expected. Retail earnings continue to roll in. Macy's boosting its outlook. Let's bring an advocate a little for more. It's been a motley picture out there for retail. Abby. Well, it really has been Lisa. Lots of mixed signals for sure. And Macy's and Beth and Body Works really adding to the picture starting out with Beth and Body Works is stuck absolutely soaring up about 20%. Now, on the year it's down in a big way. There's a short interest of 7% on this stock and Macy's. So it could be a little bit of a short squeeze. But the results were actually also good. They put out a big earnings beat. They also raised the outlook. Apparently their new and old products along with holiday packages are doing quite well. Macy's a similar picture. Their 52 cents and earnings was a big beat over the estimate of 19 cents. And they raised the profit outlook. Apparently they were able to really bring customers in despite the slowing discretionary, Jeff Genette, the CEO talking about fresh inventory being the key. So they're not having those inventory problems. And they are saying they are acknowledging, of course, that the consumer is under pressure. And they have choices to spend. Well, apparently right now they are spending at Macy's. But as I was mentioning and as you are alluding to too, not even having to do with the fact that some companies are doing well with retail. Others not doing so well. This year an incredibly difficult year for many of these retailers, Macy's and Coals and Coals by the way. They withdrew their profit outlook and the gap reports tonight down 50% of the year. What will they bring over the last year, I should say. We don't know, Lisa, just very difficult to predict this picture lots of uncertainty. Abigail, thank you a story of those that are really bad and those that are less bad. Earning separating the halves and the half-nots on a wide variety of different industries. Companies delivering mixed results with only a handful screwing the pain from tighter Fed policy. JPMorgan's ex-Ana Aranoff weighing in. There are significant lags to Fed policy. Lags as long as 12 to 18 months. And so we won't really see the full effect of this tightening probably until possibly even the midpoint of next year. And so this past quarter was really the first time that we saw inklings of the Fed's tightening having an impact on earnings. Of course, Target most prominently coming out with a pretty dreadful report. And so we're going to continue to see that. Bloomberg's Kaley Lines joining us now for more Kaley. Well, Lisa, it's so interesting to see how companies have been treated depending on whether or not they beat or missed expectations. Even a company like BJ's this morning which posted a B and raised quarter. While it looked at one point sent to open at a record high, it is now actually down by more than 6% on the day. So it just goes to show you the treatment of this market as they try and parse through every little detail that these retailers are putting out. Because as Abigail was just talking about, it's been a very mixed week. When you look at earnings season overall, about 70% of S&P 500 companies have topped estimates. So a lot have been better than fear, but look.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,231,2022-11-17 14:35:22
17618," We all was just talking about it's been a very mixed week. When you look at earning season overall, about 70% of S&P 500 companies have topped estimates. So a lot have been better than feared, but look at the sector breakdown of that 81% of energy companies beating expectations. For hard core technology, the information technology index, it's around 78%. So think the likes of Nvidia and Cisco with both top expectations with their results after the bell only 59% have talked expectations and it's even worse for communication. Think meta and alphabet advertising reliant businesses where when discretionary ad spending is getting a pull back in this macro environment, a lot of those companies have suffered. Therefore, 45% of them have not come in above what analysts expect it. And when you don't do that when you miss the punishment has been brutal in this third quarter earnings season. When you look at the average change for S&P 500 companies that have missed expectations, they fall 4.3% after earnings. That is the worst punishment received on average in at least two years, Lisa. Kayleigh, just shocking to see just how much things are moving. The lack of certainty really highlighted by some of those shifts. Black rocks keep more keeping cash levels high and risk low, writing quote we expect a softening economy, higher policy rates, and heightened geopolitical risk to cap upside on risk assets and are not yet adding to our equity allocation. We noted some cracks in management confidence. As companies across industries offered weaker guidance. Overall, we think forward numbers still have room to come down. Kate Moore joining us now. I'm so pleased to say Kate, always wonderful to get your perspectives. So what's your takeaway from this earnings season? How much are we seeing certain sectors? The a bit more realistic about the outlook ahead? Or is there no outlook to be had? Yeah, I mean, I think that's a great question, Lisa. And I think Kayleigh's points around the really negative reaction to some of the companies that didn't quite beat expectations. But I would also say there's expectations, the published stock that comes out from sort of sell side analysts, and the whisper numbers from the buy side, which in some cases were a little bit higher. I also think positioning has played a really big part in how stocks have reacted to the third quarter reports and to what seems to be very tepid guidance for 2023. You know, if these were well loved stocks or places that, you know, investors were hiding in a much more uncertain macro and market environment. And they didn't quite meet their heightened expectations. You know, they were sold. In some cases taking profits. In some cases, just overall risk management. So I think, you know, the sentiment, the positioning, played a big part in the stock reaction. And I think that's going to be really in play through the next couple months. And as you report fourth quarter in the beginning of next year, and get firmer numbers, firmer guidance numbers for full year 2023. And we're seeing that's a virgin, not only across industries, but within the industries themselves. What Bush's day and I was expecting a greater divergence among winners and losers of the earnings season. Are you writing? He's writing, while the clock has struck midnight on hyper growth in the tech industry and multiples reflect that accordingly. We believe this period of time will further differentiate the winners from the losers and the tech arms race. As we enter 2023, is that what we're seeing? A differentiation, Kate, the winners, the losers, perhaps the obsolescence of meta and still the dominance of Apple? Or is this something more wholesale about how much money was poured into a tech space? As money was basically free? Yeah, I think there's an enormous range of balance sheet, revenue opportunities, management within the sort of the tech space. And it's really hard to look at it like a monolith. On one hand, you obviously have some of these companies, more in the communication side, but generally in the tech space, that have really been dependent on advertising. And as you mentioned before, we've seen some decline in terms of overall advertising spend. On the other side, you see companies perhaps in the software space, many of whom have solid revenue prospects for 2023, who've given pretty good guidance, but we're trading at extreme premium multiples at the beginning of this year, who have derated. And while the fundamentals look okay, I don't think investors are willing to jump in wholesale at this point and to lay a sense for where the terminal rate is going to be and what the overall impact on multiples will be. So you have this really interesting and really complex environment for the technology space, where some of it is around the macro and kind of slow down and demand. Some of the fundamentals look good, but still a lot of rate sensitivity, making it really hard even though there is different",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,232,2022-11-17 14:39:25
17619," where some of it is around the macro and kind of slow down and demand. Some of the fundamentals look good, but still a lot of rate sensitivity, making it really hard, even though there is differentiation in the fundamentals to say that, you know, different parts of tech can meaningfully arc reform or really break free. Or lead in the next cycle and whatever cycle that may be. Well, we'll lead from your perspective. You know, we kind of prefer a barbelled approach in the portfolio right now. I will just tell you our overall equity risk is low relative to where it has been historically. We've kept our risk low throughout the course of 2022. That's been a smart thing for us to do and we've been using options and derivatives pretty aggressively actually to play the market more tactically. But when it comes to sectors and I look out over the next year, I see two really interesting areas. One, I think they're still prospect for upside for the resource space and that's energy and parts of materials either on a China reopening or actually on a very strong supply demand balance and strong capital discipline from any of these resource companies. So, you know, those are kind of more cyclical companies historically, but actually have strong fundamentals that we think can do well, even in a more moderate growth or a lower growth environment. And then the other side is, you know, I do think we're going to get to a place at some point in early 2023 where we have a sense for the terminal rate where multiples have come down enough and where there's enough proof in the pudding when it comes to software and actually even parts of semis that the forward growth prospects are going to be solid. And so, we like some to kind of nibble a little bit in some of those areas, some of those industries within technology. What about retail? And I realized, Kate, that this has been sort of a dirty word for a long time and the pain has been pretty vast and people could say that if there was any bubble, it has been burst and then burst again and then taken a pitchfork and thrown through it. So, at what point do you start to see value in certain names that are emerging as the behemoths? I'm thinking of Walmart doing well, Macy's doing well, Target not. And how much this really is a management selection at a time when you do have already a lot of pain baked in? Yeah, it's a great point, Lisa. I mean, retail as just like the technology is a pretty mixed bag. Companies who've managed their inventories well, who've managed their overall overhead well, maybe it's the real estate costs, etc. And those that are kind of struggling, the challenge is, you know, we were in a structural decline in terms of overall retail. We talk about it as bricks and mortar retail before the pandemic. And then there was of course, the cratering as everyone purchased things online. And then there was, you know, heightened expectations that some of the return to regular stores would pick up. But we need to remember, we're in a sort of changing consumer behavior environment, a secular trend that's going to make it harder and harder for traditional retail to perform in the way it might have done, and say in the teens. So, I think you really have to pick your specific names here. I think you have to pay a lot of close attention to how companies are talking about inventory management, how they're pivoting for consumer desires. The one thing I will say, despite kind of concern around investing in the sector, we feel pretty good about the health of the consumer in general. We just continue to grow, balance sheets still look healthy to us. And we weren't that surprised by the retail sales number that came out just a few days ago. Kate, I want to talk about that because the strength of the consumer is the bane of the Fed's existence right now because they'd like to see a little bit less so that we can get closer to their goal. We heard Jim Billard earlier this morning from the St. Louis Fed talking about how we're not yet restrictive, talking about the prospect of a 5 to 7 percent Fed funds rate if inflation keeps up. He's keeps talking, though, and he does say that he expects that rapid disinflation will take hold once the process takes in, takes effect. How concerned are you about more persistent inflation that, yes, we might get down to 5 percent quickly, but not necessarily to 3 and 2 percent that quickly, causing something that forces the Fed to go beyond where markets can tolerate, to something that causes financial accidents that the Fed is not willing to address because of their immediacy, because of the concern about inflation. Lisa, there's so many questions and so much to kind of unpack there. Let me start kind of where our rate expectations are. We're looking for another 100 basis points of rate hikes at this point, but I think the risk is skewed to the upside here. Basically, you know, on both stronger economic activity and, frankly, strong consumer activity leading to persistently high inflation. So while we are looking...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,233,2022-11-17 14:43:44
17620," on both stronger economic activity and, frankly, strong consumer activity, leading to persistently high inflation. So while we are looking for an end at some point in early 2023, or at least a pause to this part of the rate-hiking cycle, I think the question you pose about the economy staying strong enough and inflation staying sticky enough, that the Fed needs to think about re-engaging at another point. I think that's a good question and something that we're going to really have to probe. Right now, there's not enough information for us to say definitively, but that's the course. And so that's one of the reasons why we've kept our overall risk in the portfolio more moderate, and we're being, I think, more conservative, because it's very difficult to identify the exact regime that we're in or the end of this sort of rate-hiking cycle. Kate Moore, brilliant as always. Thank you so much for being with us.

If NAC was started under President Clinton and Bob Rubin was the first person to hold that job, can you explain to people what it actually does and what the NAC does day to day? For example, who's in the NAC, who's on the NAC? What is your job actually to do? The National Economic Council, the job, the mandate, the mission of the organization, is to coordinate economic policy across the executive branch and across the cabinet to make sure that the president is getting the benefit of when making decisions of his entire economic cabinet and also that the cabinet cabinet is getting clear direction from the president as well. So that two ways. So it's a coordination function. On the NAC itself are all of the relevant cabinet members, the core economic team, OMB, Council of Economic Advisors, Treasury, but also Secretary of Labor, Secretary of Commerce. My team, the NAC team is a small team within the White House that is our job is to do that coordination across the range of economic policies. Now you were the deputy in the Obama administration in the NAC, now you're the director. Which NAC work better? The Obama administration one or the Biden one? Well, on the issues that I worked on in the Obama administration, it worked very, very well. And the current NAC works very well as well. The top names in climate change are on Bloomberg.

17621," The price is paid. The price is received data by manufacturing firms in the Philadelphia region, which like in the New York region went up to 34 and changed from about 31. So we're far from having defeated inflation at this point. It's on writing speaking as we get a busy day of economic data in America. Housing starts, building permits, the Philly Fed index, and initial jobless claims all came out this morning claims unexpectedly retreating. Not necessarily a good news for a Federal Reserve where they are looking at a labor market that is still too strong for their liking. Bloomberg's Michael McKee is back with us to discuss. Mike, what is the takeaway from today's data so far? Well, it's all kind of around the margins and it doesn't give any one side winning argument, obviously, John writing is on the side of the Fed needs to do a lot more. This is what we're looking at. Housing starts and building permits both down, but we knew that basically because the housing market has really cratered since the Fed started raising interest rates. Philly Fed was interesting. They really slowed down. This is the third consecutive month that the Philly Fed index, business index has fallen. And there is obviously pessimism among Philadelphia area manufacturers about the outlook for the economy going forward. You mentioned the jobless claims numbers. Kind of what's significant about that is that this was the week that they take the payroll survey. So the fact that they went down would be one point in favor of a reasonably good November payroll number. Now as to John writing arguments about the Philly Fed and the prices received versus prices paid, you can see. The blue there is prices received and that has been going up. Companies are paying less for their inputs, but they are still charging a bit more. And until that dynamic changes, we're still going to be having some inflation problems. And that is what Jim Bullard is talking about. The jobless claims, you can see here, the bottom line is kind of, is where claims are. The top line is continuing claims. And that's the one that we want to watch, it's looking at where jobless claims are for people who are still getting claims, not just the initial claims, and they're still somewhat higher. So we're looking at maybe people not finding jobs as quickly as possible. By the way, Lisa have an update on Jim Bullard. He says that his minimum for the Fed funds rate is 5 to 5 and a quarter percent. The 7 percent is under a worst case scenario. And he did say that he expects inflation to start to go down quickly once it does start to go down. Michael McKee, thank you. And Tom Kennedy of JP Morgan, talking also about how a 7 percent type of rate would only be in a worst case scenario. He signs it about a 15 percent probability. Pimp goes Aaron Brown making the case for bonds amid the worst performance year on record, writing quote, with interest rates higher amid a challenging macro environment, we see a compelling case for bond allocations. As a recession begins and inflation slows duration is likely the first asset class to be poised for outperformance. I am so pleased to say that Aaron Brown joins us right now. Aaron, thank you for being with us. Always a pleasure to get your viewpoint. This has been one of the key issues. We're talking about the Treasury, the longer term Treasury curve rallying. You see 10 years, 30 years rallying, which is not what the Fed wants to see. So how much can you lean into that trade when that easest financial conditions and causes the Fed to go harder on the front end? I think that exactly is the condondrum that the Fed is facing and will continue to face over the next couple of months. They don't want financial conditions to ease as they move to a slower pace of rate hikes and eventually a pause. And that sort of cross section between higher rates and the Fed sort of indicating that they don't want that financial conditions to ease is going to create a little bit of a pickle because the more that we see financial conditions ease, the higher that the Fed is going to ultimately have to move rates. And so they need to really navigate their language in terms of indicating that they're moving to a slower pace because that's what the economy needs right now. But by no means do they think that this is, you know, off to the races in terms of moving towards a rate cut. Right now, keep in mind that the forward curve for interest rates is pricing in about years.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,235,2022-11-17 14:52:34
17622," Off to the races in terms of moving towards a rate cut. Right now, keep in mind that the forward curve for interest rates is pricing in about two and a half rate cuts next year. It's been a significant dramatic reprisings since the last CPI print. I think that that's overly aggressive versus what the Fed is ultimately going to deliver. And that's basically the Fed has been saying repeatedly, no, you are guys are wrong. We are not going to be cutting rates because we are concerned about how sticky this inflation is. When you take a look at how bonds and stocks have been correlated with bonds yields going down and stocks rallying and bond yields going up and stock selling off, when does that break down? When do we start to see something where lower yields on the long end is bad news and comes in tandem with a real risk off feel? That's what seems to be what you're talking about. Exactly what I'm talking about in every single recession that we've had over the last 40, 50 years, we've seen stocks and bonds negatively correlated as we move deep into the recession. When you're in a late cycle environment, which arguably we've been in over the last year or so, typically you actually see bonds perform poorly as you move later cycle. The market starts anticipating Fed hikes, bonds start to sell off and equities also can sell off in tandem, but as you move through a recession and deeper into a recession, that's when bonds start to outperform. I think that there's two necessary conditions that need to be met before we start to see that negative stock bond correlation resume. We're probably approaching that over the next month or two. The first is really see a firm crest in inflation and start to see inflation start to move lower. We've had one print on the side, the most recent print, but we need to see a couple of more inflation prints to really give credence to the view that inflation truly has peaked. The second is that we need to see bond market volatility start to subside and probably related to that, we also need to see the Fed start to slow their pace up rate hikes. We're getting to that point where I think you'll start to see more of those traditional stock bond correlation benefits start to help portfolios, but we're not, you know, we haven't certainly firmly and credibly approached that yet. And so we're really waiting for those two catalysts. This might be a good year 2023 for the long end of the Treasury curve, but what about credit? I mean, perhaps investment grade, I understand, but risk your credit, it's held in there. Why will that do well too? So I think you really need to separate credit between those that are remote to fault risk and those that are closer to potential to fault risk have a higher probability of default. I think those companies or those credits that are high quality that are investment grade and that have good free cash flow generation don't have over leverage balance sheets and you know, can operate in an environment where nominal GDP growth is not exceptionally strong and potentially even negative. I think those sort of high quality corporates will do well over the next 12 months or so. You've seen significant spread, why may you're to date, these companies are trading at, you know, good relative valuations versus equities. And so I think that's where you want to park your bets. I would say away from high yield. Aaron Brown, thank you so much as always coming up the market moving events you need to be watching. That's next in our trading diary. This is cool.

Meanwhile, the belief in India's ability to produce so many tech wizards is reinforced every year. Indians make up about three-fourths of the immigrants receiving coveted H1B visas for the US, and it's a safe bet that some of them will eventually find their way to the C-suite. I think that it's hard to put your head around any narrative, like just be honest. We've had sort of a shift in, are we in some sort of circulation fears? I'm now for the trading diary. We need to be watching through the next week. The Fed speak continues. Jefferson, Chikush, Kari, Evans, all on deck. President Collins speaking on Friday, then Mr. Bullard and George all coming up next Tuesday, finally the Fed minutes coming out on Wednesday. From New York, this was Countdown to the Open. Now with that we can... Still, it's more park. Big, expensive cities have a lot going for them. But if you live in one, you probably notice that these big, expensive cities keep getting more, well, expensive. You could always move away. You might have just started working remotely, so there's really nothing keeping you there. But then again, moving is a hassle. Well, what if someone paid you 10 grand to do it? What if they threw in free office space, a bicycle, or a gym membership? Programs and cities and states around the US are doing exactly that, and they're getting a lot of interest. We've had over 50,000 applications. We've had over 1800 applicants from all over North America. So are these nascent programs actually beneficial to their communities and the workers joining them? Or are they little more than flashy advertising campaigns for places looking for an injection of fresh talent?

17624," When innovation strikes, Bloomberg technology is there with the news and analysis unique. Every weekday, only on Bloomberg. Ferro this is with Bergerolleo. Pepsi's number fever campaign in the Philippines has probably gone down in history as one of the biggest marketing disasters in history mainly because of a human error that led Pepsi to print more winning caps than they planned the resulting chaos caused riots, civil unrest and even deaths reporting this story took over a year and it resulted in me flying to Manila in the Philippines to meet unlucky winners and to find out exactly what happened back then in the 1990s my name is Jeff Mesh, I'm a journalist based in Los Angeles, I wrote the story for Bloomberg Business Week about Pepsi's number fever campaign the Philippines is a really interesting country it's made up of thousands of islands and it's also a country that's very heavily influenced by America, American culture is everywhere you look in the Philippines they're obsessed with Frank Sinatra music for example they love all things America and that extends to their their love for soft drinks Pepsi Cola Coca-Cola in the 1990s it was everywhere Pepsi and Coca-Cola were embroiled in what is now known as the Cola Wars it was a fierce battle for market dominance number fever was already a really popular promotion it had been rolled out in America to great success and so Pepsi decided to roll it out internationally particularly in Asia they thought it was the answer to their problems they thought it could finally help them beat their biggest competitor a million pesos or six j-eight thousand dollars doesn't sound like a lot now but in 1992 that was a phenomenal amount of money you've got to remember that in the Philippines at the time the average monthly income was about a hundred dollars so a million pesos was wealth beyond anyone's wildest imaginations number fever caught fire in the Philippines kids were saving up their pocket money to buy a bottle of Pepsi parents were squirreling away all of the bottle caps in bags you would walk down the street and people were going through trash trying to find discarded bottle caps it was a national phenomenon Pepsi boasted that half the population of the Philippines was playing it number fever boosted Pepsi sales every month from ten million dollars to fourteen million dollars it had a huge impact on Pepsi's bottom line number fever quickly became number hysteria maids were being jailed for stealing their employers winning bottle caps there was even some murders over over winning bottle caps people were fighting in the streets over these caps there were signs that there were going to be problems with number fever very early Pepsi had rolled out the competition in Chile and a garbled fax had caused some kind of problem with the winning number they'd announced the wrong one in Chile causing riots there were signs that there could be big problems ahead if they didn't keep their eye on the ball so in 1992 Pepsi decided",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,238,2022-11-17 15:05:19
17625," The riots, there were signs that there could be big problems ahead if they didn't keep their eye on the ball. So in 1992 Pepsi decided to extend the campaign in the Philippines and they announced that the competition would go on for a few more weeks. One night, on the television news, they announced the latest winning number, 3, 4, 9. The problem was 3, 4, 9 had already been allocated as a non-winning number in earlier campaigns. So there were literally hundreds of thousands of bottle caps with 3, 4, 9 just floating around the Philippines. Hundreds of thousands of people all across the Philippines, thousands of islands were finding winning bottle caps. 3, 4, 9, 3, 4, 9. Some people had 10 lucky 3, 4, 9 bottle caps. People were dancing in the street, celebrating. They thought their problems were over. They were millionaires. It's still not certain exactly how many winners there were of lucky 3, 4, 9 bottle caps. But we know that Pepsi printed over 600,000 of them. Pepsi realised very early that there was a problem. Hundreds of people started arriving at their bottling plants with their lucky bottle caps. They realised something was seriously wrong. Pepsi tried to solve the problem by offering a small token donation to anyone that brought a lucky bottle cap to their bottling plant. But it wasn't enough. People didn't want just a handful of pesos. People wanted their million pesos prize. Within a year, violent protests and riots outside Pepsi factories would leave dozens injured and five people dead. At one Pepsi factory in the Philippines, a grenade was thrown through the window. It killed three Pepsi employees. Anacita Rosario was a schoolteacher living near Manila in the Philippines. She was one of the tragic victims of this whole thing. She was walking to a nearby store to buy some rice one day when a Molotov cocktail was thrown at a Pepsi truck in a violent protest. It bounced under the truck and exploded. It killed her and an innocent bystander who was just a child and injured many others. When I was in the Philippines, I tracked down anacita's daughter Cindy and her husband Raoul. It was clear to me that they were still very upset by the whole thing. A family had been ripped apart by this competition. Raoul told me that he'd never remarried. He'd told me that he'd gone to meet Pepsi executives after his wife was killed. He was angry. He said to them, this wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for you, if it wasn't for number fever. The biggest revelation from my reporting was rumors that Pepsi was somehow involved in bombing their own trucks. I found a newspaper report with a headline that said Pepsi goons bomb their own trucks. When I visited the MBI, the police department in the Philippines, they presented me with documents and interviews with people who claimed that Pepsi had paid them to cause riots and to cause trouble outside their plants. In order to destabilise the situation and to frame the owners of the coalitions that were fighting them to try and curry favour. I just thought that was so shocking and of course Pepsi denied it but help us out that a company would be accused of bombing their own trucks. The contest had sparked so much anger in the Philippines because it landed at just this really weird time in the Philippines history. It was during a crazy election that was racked with allegations of fraud. The Philippines was in a kind of love-hate relationship with America. They loved obviously the American aid and finances that was poor.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,239,2022-11-17 15:09:37
17626," With allegations of fraud, the Philippines was in a kind of love-hate relationship with America. They loved obviously the American aid and finances that was pouring into the country, but at the same time they yearned for independence. They wanted to be their own country. Vicente Del Fiero was a local preacher living in Manila, and he hated the number fever campaign. Del Fiero thought Pepsi's number fever campaign was just one of the many ways that America was asserting its dominance over a third world country. He hated seeing his fellow countrymen get ripped off in his eyes by this huge multinational American company. He wanted justice. Del Fiero rounded up over 800 winners of 349 bottle caps, and he got them all together to sue Pepsi for over $400 million to be divided between those holders of lucky bottle caps. Del Fiero took money from some of the people who could afford it. They paid him 500 pesos to help with legal fees, but for people who couldn't afford the money he would just represent them pro bono. He flew to America and he hired two consumer lawyers here in America to take on Pepsi. He had a meeting at Pepsi's headquarters to try and resolve the problem, but he said he wanted to take it all the way to the highest courts in America. When those cases were heard in America, those courts decided that this was a problem that should be heard in the Philippines, not in America. Back in the Philippines, Del Fiero continued his case in the Filipino courts. At one stage, there were arrest warrant handed out for nine Pepsi-Cola executives, which he saw as a big victory. We don't know if those arrest warrant were ever upheld, but it made newspaper headlines across the country. Pepsi did not take kindly to Del Fiero's campaign. They tried everything to shut him down. They sued him for libel. My father had to attend three times a month for a branch, one for the five, and another heating for the branch, one for the three times a month. Also, there was a time my father's hospital, who had to attend the two branch heating of otherwise, for not attending the judge, will issue water to the next one. My father passed away January 13, then after staying for almost one year in the hospital, he died of complications due to heart pain. After the death of my father, I was inspired to do the website. Pepsi could be remembered for what they did to the consumer in the Philippines and to my father. When I reached out to Pepsi for comment for this story, they claimed that they didn't have access to anyone who was working at Pepsi that was around in those days. They also said that during COVID-19, they didn't have access to their documents about this, but they were very careful to say that they were sorry for everything that happened, and we do know that Pepsi did try everything to try and make this right. The Pepsi number fever disaster cost the company millions. We know that they paid up to 10 million dollars in those good-will payments, but the financial effect could be much greater. After the disaster, we know that Pepsi sales dipped. They were overtaken by Coca-Cola again. Pepsi's number fever disaster changed the legacy of that soft drink in the Philippines forever. Some people of certain age won't touch it. For many people, Pepsi is a taboo word. A lot of the people that I spoke to.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,240,2022-11-17 15:13:52
17627," The other players for soccer players in the Bundesliga have gone up very dramatically. With such high prices they thought that by going public they would be able to compete better with big teams like Bayern Munich. Unfortunately that didn't go too well, Dortmund bought too many expensive players high wages and the club almost went bust in 2005. The price of their shares it has sometimes gone up but mostly gone down since they made that decision. So on April 11th 2017 the team was staying in a hotel on the outskirts of Dortmund. Match days are always special in Dortmund everyone is looking forward to it. The team always meets in the same hotel ahead of matches. They stayed in this hotel in order to have a kind of neutral space before game so that they could concentrate, be isolated from distractions, things like that. Everyone was pretty optimistic they had a chance to go really far maybe into the finals. I was in the office and getting ready for match day was going to meet with a friend, a fellow Dortmund supporter in the pub. As always the fans are very excited about matches. On that day they were heading to play in the quarter final against AS Monaco at Signal Idunas Stadium which is in the centre of Dortmund. Shortly before 7pm the players of the team boarded their official team bus. When the bus took off the parking lot of the hotel and turned on the street there were three detonations, three bombs that exploded and hit the table. Three explosions occurred close to the Borussia Dortmund team bus. The B team bus had just left the hotel. The explosions destroyed two windows in the rear part of the bus. People screamed, people jumped to the ground. The fellow Dortmund fan I was supposed to watch match with. He called me and said turn on the TV there was an attack of the Dortmund bus and I thought he was like there was impossible. Some of the players screamed at the driver to keep driving as fast as possible because they were worried that people might storm the bus. German investigators say the explosive devices used in the attack on the Borussia Dortmund bus contained metal pins. The one had pierced a seat headrest. Unbeknownst to the team members the actual mastermind behind the attack was as they were disembarking the bus, was actually eating steak and sweet potatoes at the hotel they had just left. Authorities were attempting to verify a letter left at the scene claiming Jihadists were behind the attack. Because there had been a series of attacks by Islamic terrorists in Germany and Europe there was a widespread suspicion in the media that this was another Islamic terror attack. Three letters were found at the site of the bombing that took credit for the attack on behalf of Islamic State. There were however reasons to doubt this particular narrative. Would actually be a surprise if ISIS were actually part of this attack, possibly could be employed by other groups like the Far Right wing to try and shift the blame. The letters had some strange qualities. They were written in a strange German that used big sophisticated words but had basic grammar mistakes as if someone was native German speaker but pretending to be a foreign person. Federal investigators have detained one man suspected of links to Islamist terrorism, one of two suspects whose apartments were raided this morning. Shortly after the bombing a man in Austria named Rudolf who was a big BBB fan he noticed that something strange was going on on the stock market related to the team shares. He emailed the lawyers of BBB who then forwarded that email on to investigators. The email stated that someone had bought 60,000 BBB put options, a wager that the value of the shares of the team would fall below a certain amount at a certain date. Why would someone buy that ahead of a match and then three bombs go off?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,241,2022-11-17 15:21:42
17628," The beauty of the shares of the team would fall below a certain amount at a certain date. Why would someone buy that ahead of a match and then three bombs go off? Something, something, something isn't right here. For the person to make money off of that, it required the stock to go down quite a bit in a fairly short period of time and it wouldn't just be the team losing a match, it would require something much bigger than that. There was another big red flag about the Spurchas, which is the fact that it had actually been made. Number one on the day of the bombing, but also from an IP address that had been traced to the actual hotel where the bombing had taken place. When three explosions targeted the bus carrying the Borussia Dortmund for ballers on April 11th, written notes left at the scene claimed the attack was the work of ISIL. The truth, as is now alleged, is remarkable. On April 21st, the police arrested a man in a southern German city called Tubingen. It was on his way to work and his name was Sergei Binaigot. He seemed like an unlikely suspect because he had no known connections to the Islamic terror world. He didn't seem like a far-right extremist, he didn't seem like a left-wing extremist either. He seemed to be a completely unremarkable young man. A 28-year-old German Russian man named only as Sergei W, stayed in the same hotel as the players on the night before the bombing. He specifically requested an upper room overlooking the bushes where the explosive devices were hidden. The media dissected why he would do that, what was his past. He had been inspired by the 2015 terror attack in Paris. And he noticed that in the aftermath of the attack, the stocks of French companies went down. And he believed that if an attack took place that was directed at a specific company, that the decrease in stock price for that company would be even more dramatic. It never occurred to anyone that someone would do that out of greed. We now know that the suspect bought three different derivatives on the Borziot Dortmund shares, with all these derivatives he bet on falling shares. The suspect bought the majority of these financial products on the 11th of April, the day of the attack. If the plot had been completely successful, and the stock had reached a value of zero, the intergolds would have made up to 570,000 euros, or the equivalent of about $608,000. Ultimately, the plan completely backfired. The attacker, Saga Venigold, didn't make any money, in fact, he lost money. In court, he would be extremely quiet. He usually kept his hands clasped together. One of the lawyers actually commented that he had never seen a defendant act so calmly. The intergold had served some time in the German military. From that information and from online research, he was able to figure out how to assemble remote, detonated bombs that would do what he hoped to do. There were a few days of extremely emotional testimony, including the soccer players who described stouting whether or not they could ever play another game again. It brought everything back up, and it didn't quite help them to kind of process what was going on. Throughout it all, he sat there completely silent. The big mystery that was swirling around the trial was the question of why he may have simply done it because he wanted to impress a woman. Rebecca is a young woman who has a very troubled home life. She ultimately sees her relationship with Vaynergold as an opportunity to leave that troubled home. Vaynergold is a Russian immigrant to Germany. He speaks with an accent. He has anxiety in large groups of Germans. She begins to resent the fact that he has these fears and feels a little bit trapped. Rebecca attempts to dump him on multiple occasions and T threatens to commit suicide if she leaves him. Vaynergold apparently...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,242,2022-11-17 15:26:04
17629," Becca attempts to dump him on multiple occasions and T threatens to commit suicide if she leaves him. Vaynergold apparently told Rebecca that she would soon be seeing a surprise. After being dumped via text message, he apparently began planning for this attack in earnest. Vaynergold was charged with 28 counts of attempted murder, which carried a maximum sentence in Germany of life in prison. He claimed that he had nothing to do with the attack, but as time went on, he admitted that he had actually been the person who had built the explosives and had set them on. But he claimed that he didn't want to actually kill anybody. Ultimately Vaynergold didn't receive the harshest possible sentence he was given 14 years in prison, but it's still a considerable amount in jail in Germany. The threats of an asteroid hitting Earth is very real. If it's big enough, it's also very final. These are very, very infrequent events. The probability is not zero, though. A blinding flash of light streaking across the sky. About 100 tons of space rock falls on Earth every day. Most of it is so small, it burns up in our atmosphere. All lands are noticed away from major populations. No human in the past 1,000 years is known to have been killed by a meteorite. And according to NASA, no large object is likely to strike the Earth any time in the next several hundred years. However, one thing is certain. We haven't found them all. There are thousands out there, and we don't know where they are. There are a lot of asteroids in our solar system. They number in billions. Scientists all over the world are working toward detecting and deflecting the most catastrophic of natural disasters. The race is on to find as many of these objects as we can. Yes, the way of calculating whether or not an asteroid is potentially dangerous or not. I mean, I think it's something worth investing in. Sorry, existence, that's safe. Right? Amy, let's get this one out of the way. It's probably the question you get asked the most. But how scared should we be? Astroids and comets are a natural hazard that's out there like a lot of other natural hazards. These are very, very infrequent events, these collision events where an object actually impacts the Earth. The most important thing that we need to know about asteroids is when the next impact is going to happen and how bad it will be. What we know is that an object that's about, say, a kilometer across is capable of causing very, very wide devastation across the planet, really, truly global devastation. The object that wiped out the dinosaurs was somewhere in the neighborhood of five to 10 kilometers across, so even bigger than that. At a kilometer, it's still going to be very bad and will have global effects. For objects that are capable of causing what I would call sort of regional damage, kind of a large major metropolitan area, a city in its surrounding environments, sort of around 100-ish meters. It depends on the details of the composition and so forth. By the 1980s, NASA was cataloging near-Earth objects. In 1994, Stargazers watched his comet shoemaker-level-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,243,2022-11-17 15:30:13
17630," 1980s, NASA was cataloging near-earth objects. In 1994, Stargazers watched as comet Schumäke-Levy 9 hit Jupiter. The resulting zone of chaos was estimated to be as large as the Earth, and the event became a turning point in the search for asteroids and comets in our solar system. In 1998, Congress tasked NASA with finding 90% of asteroids and comets, 1km wide or larger. Soon after, Hollywood blockbusters Armageddon and Deep Impact brought attention and fear to the masses. The great news is that the vast majority, more than 90% of all the really large 1km near-earth objects have been found. The challenge now is working down to these smaller sizes that are still quite capable of causing a lot of damage, but they're just harder to spot because they're fainter. They're small. Can you give us a sense of how many are out there in our solar system? We know that there are a lot of asteroids in our solar system. They number in the billions. Most of them, however, are between Mars and Jupiter in what we call the main asteroid belt. This is a region of space where most of the asteroids in the inner part of our solar system live, and they stay there for many billions of years. There is another population, though, that kind of leaks inward and gets into the region somewhat close to the Earth. And we call these near-earth objects. We think that there are millions and millions of near-earth objects that are out there in the total population. As of today, we know of sort of around 20, 25,000, something like that. When we first spot an object, we really know very little about it. We just see something moving across the sky. So all you get is just sort of a handful of snapshots, just enough to be able to tell that this isn't an asteroid that we've already seen before. And then once we can calculate the distance to it, we can now start to make predictions about its true size. Is it large or is it small? So we have a lot of information that we have to get pretty quickly to really understand what's going on. Finding asteroids is just one piece of the puzzle. Planetary scientists are extremely skilled in determining the orbits and speeds of asteroids based on relatively small amounts of data. NASA runs simulations of the trajectories asteroids could take, which is useful, but time consuming. A team of scientists in the Netherlands have found a way that could buy us more time. Our methods is very quick. So you can very quickly get an assessment of whether or not the objects is danger or not. If you look at the classical way of determining the danger of an asteroid, it may take days of computing time on very big machines to determine this hazardousness. The current problem is that there's just too many asteroids out there to spend a huge amount of computational power on all of them. So the neural network allows us to focus on what really could go and pose a hazard to Earth. A neural network is a computing system that mimics the way the human brain operates to find underlying relationships in a set of data. By training the network in this way, you train it in recognizing those objects that are most likely to hit the planet. And once it's trained, you can apply this network to all the unknown asteroids. And then you can make a selection and say, hey, these are the ones which appear to be having orbits similar to the ones which we know are hitting the planet. That doesn't mean that they do. But it only means that they look very similar to the ones we know they do. What else did you find? Should we be particularly concerned about anything? One thing that we did find is that our neural network was able to go and identify a handful of asteroids which weren't considered potentially hazardous. That when we went into the greater than four at a time, they came quite close to Earth. We find a handful which were not detected before or not considered being dangerous before and we think they are potentially dangerous. It's very hard to simulate kind of going forward in time and asteroid that's going to hit Earth because what the Earth is really small and what space is really big. And then you have to have very exact parameters to shoot an asteroid that goes and hits exactly Earth and then Cmon had.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,244,2022-11-17 15:34:38
17631," really small. And what space is really big. And then you have to have very exact parameters to shoot an asteroid that goes and hits exactly there. And then Cmon had the ingenious idea of not even trying to do that and just launching the asteroids from our surface and integrating backwards in time. It's very hard to make it hit. So you need a lot of calculations which all end up in nothing. And the idea was then like, well, let's not do that. This is basically what NASA is doing. NASA is taking an asteroid making multiple copies of them, shooting them all forwards in time, calculating their orbits, and then see what fraction sort of gets close to Earth. They'll be even hitting Earth but getting close to Earth. And then they call it a potential impactor. So you calculate the solar system forward in time for let's say a thousand years. And then you launch asteroids from the surface. As if they if you go forward in time would fall on the surface, you calculate them backwards due today and then you get your orbital parameters of today's asteroid which you know will land on the planet. And those you can use as known impactors and compare with all the other asteroids in the solar system. Consimulations and AI can those things fill in the gaps where perhaps telescopes and other imaging tools can't? Absolutely. Since the observations get more complex, the physics gets more complex. And if the physics gets more complex, the mathematics becomes more complex. And at some point you can't solve your problems analytically anymore. And then this is where the computer comes in. Now we have this trained neural network. We have a way of calculating in a fraction of a seconds whether or not an asteroid is potentially dangerous or not and therefore deserves more attention or more time to spend on for for redefining our capabilities dangerous. When it comes to hunting asteroids, time is critical. What we can do about a potentially hazardous object depends a great deal on what we know about it and how much time we have before the encounter. We'd really like to find them when they're decades away. Because the more time you have, the more options you have and the less energy it takes to to move an object aside. It also means we might not have to resort to launching a nuclear war head as an asteroid. Until recently, pretty much our only choice. That's an option of last reason. We're already in my opinion, yes. We have lots of options if you can just simply bump into the object and just nudge it out of the way. That's one possibility. And that's kind of in a way the sort of the simplest thing to think about just nudging it off its path a little bit with a massive object, a spacecraft one. So it's kind of like bowling if you will. If you have a long time or a long stretch of runway in the lane, just a very small twist on the on the bowling ball will make a big change in where it ultimately ends up. Another option would be something where you take a very big, big, massive spacecraft and you park it next to the object and you use the force of gravity as a towing rig. That takes longer, though. And you need to be able to send a pretty massive spacecraft and obviously depends a lot on how big the asteroid is. Other options start to get more and more complicated and they range from painting one side of the object of white color and painting the other side dark and then letting the pressure of lights or perturb its orbit. In a departure from the lab and computer simulations, NASA has real plans to rehearse kinetic impact deflection. In 2021, the agency will launch Dart, the double asteroid redirection test mission, which will intercept a 160 meter asteroid in 2022. Better to practice now before we have to deal with an actual threat. In the meantime, discovering asteroids is our best bet. Thousands of scientists and amateur astronomers around the world make up an informal network that surveys the heavens. But that may not be enough. NASA wants more resources to map our solar system and better technology. We need to ramp up our network of sensors and also we need to just continue to strengthen our network of international observers so that we can get follow-up because we find these objects when they're distributed all over the late sky. Once we get more observations, we get better data, we can make better predictions. If you look at the big impactors we have had in the last, let's say, 20 years or maybe 30 years or 50 years. Most of them we haven't seen coming.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,245,2022-11-17 15:39:03
17632," Let's say 20 years or maybe 30 years or 50 years. Most of them we haven't seen coming. So the danger, the real danger, I think comes from your objects we don't know about. And not from your objects we do know about. This particular natural disaster, like a lot of natural disasters and like climate change is a problem with the global commons. So the thing that we risk collectively is that it sort of then becomes nobody's model. And nobody takes ownership over it. The asteroids are all over the sky. They just truly cross boundaries and borders with a seconds notice. They're kind of imagining the future. Maybe he locks a small satellite around the earth that are always going and looking outward.

That's Vlad Tenif, the CEO of Robinhood, the online broker app, talking about how he wants his app to disrupt the world of stock trading like Amazon disrupted the world of home shopping. And I think that speaks to exactly the mission that a platform like Robinhood has, which is to democratize investing. Robinhood was started in 2013 by Vlad Tenif and by Jubat, in where else Silicon Valley as an alternative to the big brokerages, but with one big difference.

17633," in where else Silicon Valley as an alternative to the big brokerages but with one big difference. As they were building the social network around finances for people they realized that there was a gap in the market and that free trading could become something that they could bring to the markets they could disrupt the industry. While no fee trading is industry standard today it was unheard of when it was first introduced. The online brokerage industry was really innovative when they came on the scene 10-15 years ago but they kind of stopped innovating where you haven't seen those commissions come down beyond 5 or 6 or 7 dollars. Robin Hood, think that by offering zero commission that they're going to push people onto this platform. And on top of no fee trading the customers Robin Hood was courting have been long overlooked in the world of finance. So the typical customer of a Charles Schwab for example is putting a lot more money in that brokerage account than the typical customer at Robin Hood. Even today with all of its popularity the median account size is about 240 dollars. There's fiddellities in the Schwabs in the e-trades of the world. They look down their nose and it does kind of account that. I don't want a thousand dollar account. They're just the headache. I want a hundred thousand dollar account. And this is key here right because the thing about Robin Hood that's different than every other single brokerage platform is how easy it is to use. The design of the Robin Hood app really has in mind a user who might be coming at this absolutely cold. The fonts are very well sized the shapes the colors all of that is something that the founders of Robin Hood paid really close attention to. And by creating an interface that catered to a newer investor they were able to gather a pretty healthy group of customers. And by 2019 they had about 10 million customers. Those 10 million customers were a huge success story for Robin Hood but no one could have predicted its explosion after the arrival of COVID-19. Remain indoors to the greatest extent and 100% of the non-essential workforce must stay home. What we saw when the pandemic hit was the growth of Robin Hood users absolutely turbocharged. And oddly you saw this surge in interest in stock trading. Then they saw the absolute surge in 2020 in customer growth. And now by many accounts they have more than 20 million customers which is pretty extraordinary. So the next step for them is to figure out how to monetize those users and how even with their small account sizes to get them to grow with the company. And as it releases more products come along with them. Robin Hood would become one of the COVID economies break out successes. Robin Hood traders as they're called became the shorthand explanation for the frenzy of often speculative retail investing after the pandemic lockdowns. Kids wake up in the morning they go on Robin Hood. They're you know in the shower they check Robin Hood. Kids are learning how the stock market works at 18 while they're at school. You know checking their phones in between classes because notifications pop up telling them what their stocks are doing that day. With these new tools millennials and Gen Z are investing in the market in ways their parents could have never even dreamt of. That is sort of key when we talk about the divide between older and younger generations is that the young.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,247,2022-11-17 15:47:39
17634," as their parents could have never even dreamt of. That is sort of key when we talk about the divide between older and younger generations is that the younger generation is exposed to so much more information and tools at their disposal to do what they want in the market. The older generations, you never had the technology or the cost structure that you could play the markets like you can today. So you were stuck with giving your money to a professional investor and paying them a fee to do it. When I speak to young kids, they tell me I'm making mistakes, I'm losing money, I'm not a perfect investor, but I'm 18 and by the time I'm 30, which will be 10 years from now, I'm going to have interacted with the markets for a decade. And so it's a learning experience more so than anything else. And you can look at it and you can say, wow, that's risk taking that's dumb. But you know, if you could possibly shave 10, 20 years off your working life versus adding five years, I don't think you can fault people for that. But Robinhood is only part of the puzzle. Sure you can trade on it, but without research, information and data, you're just blindly throwing darts at different stocks and hoping to strike it rich. Wall Street forever has always run on what we now called narratives or needs. You know, people telling rumors to each other, they've been around for 100 years. On Wall Street, information is its own currency. Historically, either you had it or you didn't. And the people who had it had a huge advantage. In the past, those narratives and memes didn't have a network effect. It would be one person telling another person over the phone. In fact, when I broke into this business in the 80s, a lot of people used to complain that they weren't on the call list to get those ideas. Social media changed all of that. It's fast forward to 2021. That's being done on the internet now. And that's being done on Discord and Twitter and Stocktwitz and Reddit. And the impact is very similar, but orders and orders is meant to too larger. Social media has played a bigger part in our lives. It's also played a bigger and kind of more important role in how people find investing ideas online and on these platforms. How do those ideas spread? On TikTok. Yes, that TikTok. Soon, may the women come to bring a sugar and tea and rum. People aren't just going to it for C-Shanty videos. The personal finance hashtag on TikTok has garnered 3.5 billion views from its 1 billion monthly active users. By comparison, videos found under the cooking and health tips hashtag have 2.6 and 2.1 billion views respectively. The trajectory of Robinhood and TikTok were literally on par. What happened in the stack market this week? So the word of the week is expectations. Absolutely essential that you understand the risks of shorting. And Kayla Kilbrot and Kyla Scanlon are two of those financial influencer TikTokers, also known as Fin Fluensers. I think people still care about fashion, they care about culture, but it's also like there's this big behemoth thing called the stack market that we really don't know a whole lot about and it's gay kept behind the industry. And so people like want to unpack that. And so my audience is, a lot of them are younger investors who are looking to hone their skills. Tech in right up. And Kyla and Kayla are two of the more, let's say, professional TikTok influencers. The Tesla Arc Bitcoin biotech risk cluster. I've been trading since high school and it was a really interesting way for me to fill out my decision making frameworks and to think about thinking. And I think that the more that we can have people thinking about finance, the better that we're going to progress as a society, I think it's a huge gap in our educational system. If you're going to buy an option for stock, you think it's going to go up. It's a call. So think about like this. I'm going to get the options video where I was like options are just like shopping. Rumor has it that this pal is about to go up in price. So if I come in tomorrow, can I still buy it at a price? And a ton of women just like attacked that video and we're like, you explain things so much better than my boyfriend or my professor or like, I could sit and listen to you all day and I was like, this is what I was looking for.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,248,2022-11-17 15:52:12
17635," Thanks so much better than my boyfriend or my professor or like I could say I listened to you all day and I was like the this is what I was looking for. But TikTok's algorithm does not reward common measured videos about responsible investing. It rewards this watch this video for 30 seconds and you'll be rich for the rest of your life. I try not to say the a word, the a l g o word, because TikTok listens to us. The algorithm does impact how you feel. You know, you do notice which videos do better versus which videos do worse. How do you catch some attention in less than 60 seconds? And how do you make it something that they're like, I need this in my life, nearly impossible to do that in 60 seconds. But the people who perfect it are the people that you're going to watch and get to stick around and where people are sticking around, read it. And it's nearly countless subreddits about finance. And by far the biggest one of those is Wall Street Bence. There's a lot of social media platforms out there, but Reddit is like the social media platform for finance places like Wall Street Bence is where it all goes down. Started in January 2012, it wasn't long before Wall Street Bence adopted a 4chan like etiquette leading to their tagline like 4chan found a Bloomberg terminal. We had all these unexplained stockings and we would be grasping for wide stock XYZ jumped 20% in a day. And you would look at Wall Street Bence and you would see people there talking about buying options in that stock and it sort of squared the circle so to speak and started making sense. And it was at that point that it was like, wow, we have to start paying attention to this. Some people on the platform really spend tons of time and others are just looking for entertainment and to have a little bit of fun effectively gambling or looking for an outlet trying to make a little bit of money. Then on top of all of that, there were stimulus checks now clearly this money is going to people who need to use that to eat to live, but there's a lot of people who use this money to invest in the stock market. And it's not just stock tips. People quote unquote, yo-lo, their entire life savings or stimulus checks on a single stock. They post what is called gain and loss porn. Screen grabbing staggering hits and misses on stocks for the entire community to see. I am back to lose everything. And while some of the people on Wall Street Bence are novice investors, the community contains multitudes. In one respect, what it did show us among these network groups is they are very sophisticated. They're not a bunch of ignorant people talking to other ignorant people. And this is where the pieces of the puzzle all come together to reach havoc on Wall Street for a solid week in early 2021. It's pretty clear that the combination of more people having retail brokerage accounts and trading apps and more people being stuck at home looking for some kind of entertainment and some kind of community online came together in this very singular way. What came together is GameStop. Let's go back to the beginnings of what happened with GameStop a couple of years ago. On the boards like Reddit and StockTwist, a lot of people were talking about GameStop as being attractive value. Some of them are even, you know, Wall Street alums who left the industry and now still have access to tools that they can use to improve their financial well-being and make very good decisions. And I think Warring Kitty is a perfect example of that. GameStop is one of the most compelling asymmetric opportunities in the market today. Really, I don't understand how you can disagree with that. At the same time that this crowd was talking it up, the hedge fund institutional crowd didn't like the stock at all and it had the largest short interest of any stock in the New York Stock Exchange going into late 2020. Short selling is a bet that a stock price will fall and it's a fairly simple concept. An investor borrows a stock and then sells it. The investor is betting on buying the stock back later for a lower price before returning it to the original owner pocketing the price difference. What a short seller would tell you is that they almost act as a policeman in financial markets or they're at least looking for companies that aren't what they say they are. And that can range anywhere from an...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,249,2022-11-17 15:56:29
17636," Act as a policeman in financial markets, or they're at least looking for companies that aren't what they say they are. And that can range anywhere from an outright fraud that some short sellers try to expose to just a company that's not worth as much as investors think it is. The problem is if the stock price rises, the short seller has to come up with the money to buy the stock back. The more it rises, the more it costs. And that's what's called a short squeeze. And the hedge fund Melvin Capital was on the wrong end of that squeeze. Melvin Capital lost over 50% of its money in the month of January alone just from being caught in the short squeeze of the stock. This is where the disruption comes in. One of the most wild stories you're ever going to see, GameStop shares absolutely going nuts. In less than a year, the company's stock has jumped from less than $3 a share to almost $350. Cheers everybody! Roaring Kitty has turned $50,000 or so investment into some $14 million. Investors all over social media use the free trading app Robinhood to wreak havoc on Wall Street. They're actually piling on into some of these stocks to really hurt the professional short sellers. And they all used Reddit, Twitter, TikTok and Discord to tell one another to keep buying and quote, hold the line and not sell GameStop. People are getting cheerleaded for jumping in, buying at the highs, they're saying keep going. And it was working too, until. Thursday morning, the trading app Robinhood sent out this tweet. In light of current market volatility, we are restricting transactions, including GameStop. People were really angry. Robinhood was supposed to allow the regular people to play the same game these big boys are playing, but instead we were all taken for schmucks and they screwed us. Shares of GameStop are jumping again now that retail investors are being allowed to buy shares of the stock. But what we learned is that when people organize online, they have the ability to disrupt the market. And it was a big sign that ivory rolls and institution aren't as powerful as maybe the institutions let them to be. I don't know if pumping out GameStop was the best use of billions of dollars, but I think that as a signal to society, it was pretty interesting and powerful. The GameStop saga was so impactful that both Vlad Tenev and Rorynkitty were called into testify before Congress to clarify each of their roles in the saga. One thing that's emerged from the Congressional hearings is that they're interested in how retail brokerages make money and whether they're keeping the best interest of their customers in mind, but it's pretty fuzzy as far as what they would actually do as a result. While the frenzy around GameStop eventually subsided, it didn't take long for retail investors to find other areas to invest their money. Take a look at Bitcoin going bananas over the weekend. Bitcoin forms a brand new all-time high. It was after GameStop started to drop that we saw Bitcoin really go up to over 60,000. How much further does this rally have to run? It's compelling to say that money shifted from one venue to the other. While correlation doesn't equal causation, there's a chart out there showing an inverse correlation on mean stocks going down and cryptocurrencies going up. There's definitely an aspect where people are making money on stocks and then moving, you know, they're agnostic, they're not hedge funds, they can invest wherever the hell they want. It's a classic sort of momentum trade. They're going to wherever the winners are and they're willing to jump on and, you know, ride it. So whether it's mean stocks like GameStop, mean coins like Dogecoin, or entirely new ways to invest in art like NFPs, the new kind of retail investor is making its presence known. Over the next 10, maybe 15 years, you're going to continue to see whether by choice or by force, that baton go from older generations to younger generations.

17637," By choice or by force, that baton go from older generations to younger generations. I don't think any single app is going to be the thing that disrupts. I think people are the disruptors. How people get ideas about what to invest in has become increasingly entwined with social media. And as social media companies govern more and more of our lives, the fact that now they're tied in more intimately to people's wallets is something that we might want to understand better. Usually what disruption I think means is technology comes in whether it's blogs, the newspapers, or online, retailing to brick and mortar. They come in and they're in the same business, but they just do it in such a gigantic cost savings that it causes everybody to switch. Well that's the risk that happens here is that it's so much cheaper to just manage your own money. We're not there yet, but costs and conveniences are moving in that direction. So I'd say Wall Street you haven't been disrupted yet, but you could be in the coming years and that the final chapter on this story hasn't been ripped. Meet Bloomberg's own David Nicholson. Now his happy place is out in the field, on the open road. But like the rest of the world lately, he's been working from home a lot more than he's used to. COVID-19 has prompted a massive urban exodus as professionals of every ilk yearn for more space to live and work. As a result rural areas have exploded and they're poised to experience a resurgence as more and more families pack up and leave the big city to try out life in the berms. But there's one problem with that. Not all internet speeds are created equal. Anyone who might need to upload or download large files for a living may not want to pack up and move to that cabin in the woods just yet. Now David's house isn't a cabin, but it is in the woods and inexplicably his internet is workable. My internet is okay. I pay a lot for it. It's around $140 a month. The download speed is great and the upload speed is terrible, which is really bad for my work because I have to upload these massive files. But I'm definitely one of the more lucky ones in this community. Just a few miles down the road my buddy has awful internet. Usually under two down and under point two up. So it's it's often unusable. Some days it's around one and other times it'll drop down to about point two point three. I just want to be able to have internet at my house without having to go outside the normal ways of acquiring internet. It's it's really frustrating. We're literally miles a few miles away from downtown and it just cuts off. This is a problem and the solutions are not there yet because getting high speed internet and rural areas on mass is something our providers may simply not be ready for. If your internet service doesn't have fast download and upload speeds, then you don't have high speed harmony. You have Americans on average pay about $70 a month for internet at home, but in rural areas it could cost a lot more for a lot less service. So the pricing for a fixed wireless provider here can be something between $80 and $150 for about 25 megabits per second. However",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,251,2022-11-17 16:05:00
17638," So the pricing for a fixed wireless provider here can be something between $80 and $150 for about 25 megabits per second. However, Gigabit's service, which is a thousand megabits per second and symmetrical, is running at about 119 a month or 130 a month. That's John Paul. He co-owns Spiral Fiber, an internet service provider here in Nevada County, California. And for the past 10 years, he's been trying to bring an affordable fiber optic network to town. It all started when he applied to be part of the pilot program for Google's fiber service. Across the country, civic boosters have been going to extreme, chanting, singing, and marching, trying to get the search engine giant to look at their town. The internet these days is crucial to be in the world, to be a part of the world, and to be connected to your community. Google ultimately went with Kansas City, Missouri, which left Paul on a mission to get funding to lay out fiber optic networks for Gigabit service. Over the next several years, he would attend conferences and pitch venture capitalists and apply for grants to make his vision come to life. One of the biggest roadblocks to building infrastructure for the internet here in the United States are the existing large providers. They have their landstaked out, they would prefer that nobody come in and compete against them. In 2013, we applied for a grant. We went down and met with the commissioners at the California Public Utilities Commission. It was an arduous process to get funded. But we finally did against all odds. We got a $60 million grant and then we went out to seek venture capital. Then in March of 2020, the pandemic hit the world. Everybody got locked down and everybody came home. And everybody started using the internet. And I remember seeing on one of the local fixed wireless providers websites, they've said, hey, we know you're all staying home, but please don't use too much video and please don't use too much bandwidth. And I thought that doesn't work. The US connectivity gap is far greater compared to countries that are considered its peers economically. Some developing nations actually have better internet than rural America. Like in Kenya, which has a state-of-the-art fiber optic network fed in from their coastline. The American connectivity gap does largely affect rural areas that are either outside of service coverage or simply prohibitively expensive. This is Rebecca. She and her family moved to Nevada County just a couple miles down the road from David. They took for granted that high-speed internet would just exist in the area and it's not something they even bothered to check on before buying their house. Turns out all they got was dial-up. We wanted to move where we had a little more space, room for the kids to run around, you know, just be out in the mountains a little bit more. Having come from a bigger city area where Wi-Fi is pretty readily available, we hadn't really considered that in our purchasing of the house, whether that would be an option or not. When school started and now that we are remote learning with our children and we're doing everything from home, we didn't have the option to do that at our house. So every day when school would start, we'd have to pack the kids up and we'd go to my in-law home, they have a little cabin at the this area that does have Wi-Fi already. Rebecca's situation is the norm in rural America. According to data from the Federal Communications Commission, just 4% of urban Americans lack access to broadband internet. That's compared to almost 40% of people who live in rural areas. While that was the case, there were also racial and socioeconomic divides in terms of who had that access. In addition to that geographic difference, low income African American students, Latino students and first generation of college students were more likely than others to have only one device at home that shared among multiple siblings and or lack access to that actual connection. For most American towns, there's also a lack of competition, forcing internet prices up. And large providers like AT&T and CONCAST aren't incentivized to expand service to these rural communities. This is how Xfinity makes life simple, easy, awesome. So in our area, we have a small imprint of CONCAST, but they're not going to go out to the more rural areas. It's just not cost effective for them to do it as a large company. In order to lay fiber cable, you're actually physically digging trenches into the ground. And that's a must.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,252,2022-11-17 16:09:41
17639," It's just not cost effective for them to do it as a large company. In order to lay fiber cable, you're actually physically digging trenches into the ground. And for internet service providers, they're primarily focused on maximizing their profits. And so the fewer customers you have in any square mile and the more fiber you have to lay, that's just kind of harder to pencil out from a purely economic standpoint. AT&T released a statement on the matter, expressing the need and desire for government assistance to fund fiber optic expansion to areas deemed unprofitable. Comcast released a similar statement encouraging more public-private collaboration on this effort. Federal agencies do offer grants to help communities build broadband networks, but many have argued that there's not enough flexibility on how to use these funds. The COVID-19 relief package passed by Congress in March and signed by President Donald Trump awarded $43.3 million to 51 projects on the East Coast alone. But it also stipulated that these projects needed to be up and running by December 30th. For contractors who plan projects months and years in advance, it's a scramble to rearrange their schedules to meet that deadline. So what we've been asking the federal government to consider is at least as long as the projects are getting started, knowing the projects are being put into place to expand both remote learning, working from home and opportunities like that that are truly driven from COVID. We're moving as fast as we can regardless, but hopefully they'll give us some more time. Talking to John Paul, it's clear that he believes broadband is something that can transform a community and should be considered a public good. One of the first communities to come on in the United States with full on gigabit service was Chattanooga, Tennessee. Now they're a bigger city, but they're a city that was economically in a downturn. In the last 15 years, the city of Chattanooga has turned around in an amazing way. It's a nexus for young people to move to, it's a place where technology happens. It's not just about logging on to Zoom to connect with your colleagues who might be in New York City. It's also your ability as a small business, you know, operating in the town of Nevada City or wherever it may be to quickly upload your payroll documents or something onto the cloud or to quickly swipe a customer's credit card. There's just some really basic business functions and mechanics that I think people in big cities really take for granted and that are just going to be a much bigger challenge for small business owners and rural areas. One, two, one, two. One, two, one, two. Thank you. Historically, the marginalized people, you call them as untouchables or dhaliths, they have been kept away from the center of the knowledge. Once you're born into a caste, it is very difficult for you to grow beyond that. You are stuck in that identity. Education is the best way of liberating them, so that's how I chose to work in education sector. The kind of education that we are giving to the marginalized people is going to change not just the fate of these communities in Telangana, it is going to be the source of inspiration, source of...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,253,2022-11-17 16:13:44
17640," It is going to change not just the fate of these communities in Telangana, but it is going to be the source of inspiration, a source of hope for all the marginalized in this country. Greatest flight in India is the system of caste. For generations of Indians, the social code known as the caste system has defined how people earn a living and whom they marry. Although outlawed seven decades ago, caste remain a significant factor in deciding everything, from family ties and cultural traditions to educational and economic opportunities. Dalits, people who are on the lowest rank of the caste system, constitute almost one-fifth of India's population of 1.3 billion. Not able to afford the high tuition of private schools, many are forced to attend government-funded institutions, which in the past have suffered from poor infrastructure, lower education standards, and high student-to-teacher ratios. But Dr. Praveen Kumar is trying to change that. I am currently working as head of the Lengana Social Welfare Residential Schools. So totally, about 400 schools I managed, these are all residential schools for the students who are historically marginalized but talented and then poor. Of them, 60% are girls and then 40% are boys, because girls are more marginalized among them marginalized. Their voices are always suppressed. My approach to improve the conditions in the schools has been put your eyes and ears on the ground always. Stock to the parents, stock to the teachers, stock to the students, stay in the schools and then understand their problems, their challenges, both in classrooms and then the corridors and the dorms. Then go to the dining halls and see what kind of food they are eating, and then go to their homes and then what kind of food they are getting. And what kind of challenges the parents have. I see what they have. They have seen the same. Very good night class. One of the important changes that I brought in after I took over was to complete the transformation of mother tongue to English medium because English medium, as I said, English is the language of emancipation and language that connects you to the whole body of knowledge in the world. So, we had to train a lot of teachers. The result of the big time also. And finally, the new meaning. As far as I know, you described it as a part of the story. Hey, Ruchin, how are you? I see you fine. Thank you. I have a good view. I find the lesson a lot. Identity is extremely important. There is a scientific evidence to prove that, you know, your sense of identity is extremely crucial to your growth as a successful human being in your life. If you accept an identity which is very humiliating, which reminds you of very painful past, I think, that identity will not help you to grow. Not that I am not saying that you should forget your past. I am not saying that. But that should not be the bubble in which you must live always. Sweros is an alternative identity. S stands for state. W stands for welfare. Aero. S.W. And then Aero is Swero. So, the idea is your dreams have to be skybound. So, that is what we are trying to achieve by changing the identities. Like, you know, you say, I am a Swero. And I aim to be a doctor. I am a Swero. I aim to be a top-notch engineer. I am a Swero. I aim to be a top bureaucrat of this country. I am a Swero. I want to be a very good actor or, you know, a musician in this world. So, these are the positive images that are associated with identity.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,254,2022-11-17 16:18:06
17641," So, these are the positive images that are associated with the identity. Just to give an example to you. See, in 2012, in our institution, we used to produce about 6 doctors per year. But because of our, you know, this self-eliberating ideology of Sweroism, we have this year, we have produced about 189 doctors. This is phenomenal for any purists of the poor people. You know, how difficult it is to get into a medical college is in this country. So, but today, because of this ideology, the students have been able to achieve this, you know, feet. Pujita has been a form-lebra. And appearance, the angels are agriculturally diverse. And then this girl used to sell vegetables, but thanks to the residential education institutions, she came to the Gowl-Edo D campus and then she toiled very hard for one year, despite many problems. And today, I'm so happy to share with you that, you know, she has joined one of the prestigious medical colleges in the state of Telangana, Usmane Medical College and then in future, and she hopes to be a gynecologist. So, this is the journey our children are hoping for. Similarly, the Mount Everest Expression. Mount Everest Expression, we are very fortunate enough to place the youngest ever female in the history of this world on the peak of Mount Everest. How did this happen? It's all because of an ideology that helps you to liberate yourself. People, a lot of extracurricular activities and most of them got institutionalized now. So, for example, music. Similarly, the games, we have so many coaching academy, boxing academy, we have Brazilian academy, we have a handball academy. So we have, you know, Kabadi, the traditional Indian sport. We have goal, we have introduced a goal for all. A goal is generally played by so-called rich people, but today, even poorest of the poor people also are being trained in our goals in our schools. Wow. So, our intention has been to give all 360 degrees, you know, type of opportunities to the students, so that, you know, whoever is interested in whatever activity they can go and then do it. Break the barriers, break the fence at least mentally, because the poor people have been programmed to be victims, programmed to be subjugated, programmed to be on the margins, always programmed to feel inferior. We wanted to change all that. There are certain games which are exclusive to rich people. There are certain languages which are exclusive to middle class and upper middle class in this country, to put it in one word. The sole aim of introducing all these co-curricular activities is to break the stereotypes which are recklessly imposed on these people. There are stereotypes Dr. Kumar knows all too well. Born a Dalit, his grandparents were laborers and access to the village well was restricted. Dr. Kumar credits his parents' belief in the power of education with helping him realize his aspirations. He went on to join the Indian Police Service, attended Harvard University and then began pursuing educational reforms back home. I attribute whatever I am today to my mother primarily. They educated me in the village, although there were no good schools. So then I stayed in social welfare hostels, the hostels which are managed by government for the poorest of the poor kids. I passed with reasonably good grades, then I went to university and then I faced a worst form of discrimination. And the university is like, in those days I am talking about the bathrooms and toilets were exclusive to mental health and social care. We used to fight discrimination on one hand and then again try to excel in academics day",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,255,2022-11-17 16:22:25
17642," It's where exclusive demand for shall cause and shall try. We used to fight discrimination on one hand and then again, you know, try to excel in academics day in and day out. So that's how I came to education because I deeply believe that education is the only important weapon that can really, you know, place the poorest of the poor people from a very victimhood orbit to prosperous orbit. Think of in future, but this is going to be a game changer for the marginalized in this country. If you look at a thermal image of a city and then compare that to a map of vegetation, you'll find that where there's greenery, the temperature is lower. That's because things like asphalt, concrete and shingled roofs absorb more heat from the sun than trees. This is the urban heat island effect and it accounts for higher temperatures in cities, often by several degrees compared with their surroundings. It's becoming a huge risk to human health as growing urban populations exacerbate the heating effects of climate change. Heat waves kill more people than any other extreme weather event, more than tornadoes, hurricanes and even floods. That's why urban heat island mitigation strategies are being studied in Singapore by a group of researchers. The government back project called Cooling Singapore is now in the process of combining everything they've learnt to create a digital tool that can help cities all over the world, starting with Singapore. In Singapore, close to the equator, temperatures regularly rise above 32 degrees Celsius or 90 degrees Fahrenheit. And the city structures only make it worse. And that is also the case for Singapore, which is basically a concrete jungle, more urbanized, more developed city. And even in Singapore, what you have is a situation whereby there's a temperature difference of 7 degrees Celsius between the more urbanized and the more rural areas. The government has taken drastic steps to keep temperatures down. This is Gardens by the Bay, an award-winning park. And inside this greenhouse is a pleasant 24 degrees. That's because the dome, along with two dozen nearby towers full of thousands of people, is chilled by what's probably the world's largest underground district cooling system. It uses a large central plant that cools water and then pipes it into banks, residential towers, an exhibition centre, shopping malls and the city's iconic Marina Bay Sands hotel and casino complex. So one of the biggest perks of using this system for the buildings is that they can save 40% in terms of electricity usage compared to your traditional air conditioners. And with Singapore relying on natural gas for most of its power, this new system means emission savings equivalent to removing 10,000 cars from the city's roads. That has big implications for the rest of the world. If things stay as they are, more than a third of the world's electricity could in...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,256,2022-11-17 16:26:43
17643," from the city's roads. That has big implications for the rest of the world. If things stay as they are, more than a third of the world's electricity could end up being used to call buildings and vehicles by 2050. As the world gets hotter, gets warmer, there is a greater need for air conditioning and as well as refrigerators for instance. And the more people are buying these household appliances, the more energy usage they use and they release heat more and that then exacerbates climate change. It's a vicious circle and so since 2017, researchers at Calling Singapore have been identifying design solutions that reduce our need for so much cool air in the first place. One thing many cities have in common and that's the importance of vegetation. That's a very important measure to mitigate the urban heat because of the shading effect of course and the psychological effects of the vegetation and also because of the possible evaporative cooling effect of the vegetation. Vegetation can be of course on the ground floor in form of trees and shrubs and you can walk under them. This is the so-called canopy layer that the vegetation forms above us but vegetation can also go up the façades of buildings and it can go to the roof of the buildings. Luckily Singapore has been striving for the garden city feel for quite some time. It was a vision initially introduced by them Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew in 1967 to make life more pleasant for people and today Singapore is one of the world's greenest cities in terms of urban vegetation. Camping Admiralty, a community centre that contains health facilities and social spaces now provides more green space than the plot of land it was originally built on. It's topped by a roof scape of staggered terraces covered in local plants which functions as a community park and a village green in the centre that contains farm plots for residents to tend to. Park Royal on Pickering was designed as a hotel in a garden that doubled the green growing potential of its site. There's now 15,000 metres of sky gardens, reflecting pools, waterfalls, plantar terraces and green walls and the government has big plans as well. Singapore actually has a plan to plan one million trees and add more green spaces over the next 10 years. It is actually a mix of one thing to reduce the urban heat island effect but on the other hand is also to get the people to be more connected to nature. But it's not enough. The city state has still been warming twice as quickly as the wild average over the past six decades. That's why calling Singapore has developed a catalogue of other potential heat mitigation measures. When you try to mitigate the urban heat island effect in a city or in any building in a village as well, the first place to start is by shading of the windows. You have to keep areas clear so that the wind can move through it. Water of a certain depth can act as a very good thermal buffer. If you have to construct heavy buildings such as high rises, at least you can make the surface the facade less heavy and you can protect it from direct sun penetration. You have to make sure that no combustion engines will be in the city in the middle and the medium to long term range. So ideally the electricity production is outside of the city and you bring just the clean electricity into the city. You cannot at least minimize the use of energy in the city and you can start to slowly convert the roofs, the facades of the city into production areas for renewable energy. In Singapore unfortunately this is a limited option but in the long run it could produce up to 20-25% of the energy of the electricity needed in Singapore.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,257,2022-11-17 16:31:05
17644," 25% of the energy of the electricity needed in Singapore have all the roofs and the areas in the buildings on the buildings on the facades will be used to do that. With so many different ideas, cooling Singapore is also designing a virtual model of the city to test them out. It's called a digital urban climate twin or duct. The will calculate how each element of the city's design will impact the urban heat island effect. That means we model not only the geometry of the buildings digitally, but also we model the transportation, the insulation, the temperature, the radiation coming from the sun, the weather, the local weather, the local climate, the even very, very microclimate of the city, the water, the movement of people in the city. We can invent scenarios, we can design scenarios, test them before we actually build them and if they test very well and we are sure that they will function, then we can start to build them and put them into reality. Singapore will be using this new tool to figure out which actions it should take next and the model can be applied to any city, whether it needs to keep heat out or keep heat in, which will ultimately save energy, slow climate change and improve our quality of life. So this is something that Singapore will be able to export, maybe even together with its city development systems that it already has. Singapore is one of the very few cities in the world that really combine this scientific approach with a very well established urban redesign and design approach through its agencies and the combination of its agencies. It has achieved a lot in the past. If it keeps following the scientific path and the combination with the other knowledge in the city already, we think that it will be a very comfortable and very livable city in the future even more than today. Times are tough, jobs are scarce, it's risky to be outside and around others. It seems like there's very few ways to make extra money during a pandemic. So I guess I'll just tucker down and binge social media until this all blows over. Ah, wait, don't these people make money? How do these people make money? Streamers, YouTubers, Twitch stars, how do they make money? Is it a lot? Is it a lot of work? I know, I gotta ask somebody in the biz and I got just the guy, Austin John plays. This is your full-time job now, right? As of November of last year, yes, this was always just kind of like a side thing. Like, any money that I made from doing my videos and whatever else, I never touched that because I didn't really think of that as being like real money and then it started coming in more and more and then it was like I hit my first day that I broke a grant and I was like, this is actually gonna be money. How did the YouTube channel come to be? When the game Pokemon Sun...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,258,2022-11-17 16:35:38
17645," I broke a grand and I was like, this is actually gonna be money. How did the YouTube channel come to be? When the game Pokemon Sun and Moon came out for the 3DS, there was like, things that I learned about the game and then I wanted to just share that information with people. And at the time, I didn't have any way to capture or screen or anything, so I found like generic footage and I kind of put it all together with so much editing. And that video got six views. And then two days later, I made another one. And that one got 12 views. And then I just started pumping out more and more content and people were like, this guy knows what he's talking about. It really just started building on top of itself and then it was like, my channel really focuses on tips and tricks. So I play a straight 18 hours and I'll finish the game or get to about the 40 hour mark. And then I'll make my first video. While I'm going through, I have a giant no pad and just scribbles everywhere. And I make these notes of like the things that stumped me. So I know the things that may stump other people. What do you need to think about if you're building your YouTube channel? One, you need to do something that you're passionate about. Not that you like, not that you think you're gonna make money on, something you're passionate about. The other thing is something that other people are passionate about. It holds a special place to them. And third is, it needs to be something that people are gonna seek out information on. In order to enter into the marketplace, you either need to be better than everyone else. You either need to be faster than everyone else or you need to be more accessible than everyone else. And you can't be more accessible because it's already on the platform granted. If you understand how the algorithm works, which is very similar to Google Analytics, then yeah, you can have a little bit of a head start. But if you're not doing it faster, and if you're not doing it better than everyone else, then why should anyone watch your channel? So my income as a YouTuber kind of breaks down to three different ways. One, which is the bulk of it, which is ad revenue. Whenever you go and you watch a video and then there's an ad and then you wait five seconds and you hit the bottom right corner, and then you go on to the next video or a non-skippable ad or the video starts in media, you get the little banner ads at the bottom or if you scroll down from the video, the first thing that shows there is an ad. Those are the four different types of ads that can appear on every single YouTube video. And all of them pay the certain amount. It varies on lots of things, like the country of the person who posted the country of the person who watches it, the time of year where you are in the quarter. If there's anything going on with a reduction in ad revenue, like great example, COVID-19, companies weren't as spending as much on advertising. So because of that, CPM went down. CPM stands for a click per thousand and using the Roman numeral for a thousand. And that means that for every 1000 views, you get a certain amount of money. Now on low ads, when I first started off, my CPM was 30 cents. So every 1000 views, I made 30 cents. But then once I signed with an MCN and I started making more quality content and more engaging content, some of my better videos, and certain times of the year, I can see CPMs as high as 12 to 14 dollars. And there's a big fluctuation between, you know, if I post a video, when there's no ads being spent like January and February, that's a reason a lot of your favorite YouTubers and also TV shows don't post new videos in that time of year because ad rates are down. Why are they going to make content then? Instead, you're recording and you're bulking up for when ad revenue is higher. The second way that a YouTuber makes income is support, crowdfunding, things like that. When I first started off, Patreon was really the only option, but then they started rolling out supporters and members for YouTube channels. So whenever I have a livestream, you can click a button and then you could become a member and then you get special icons next to your name. I believe they're called badges or on any video. You can hit the join button and that helps support the channel. And then the third aspect of that would be merch. And for me, my merch has been somewhat basic. In fact, I'm wearing one of my T-shirts from...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,259,2022-11-17 16:39:58
17646," And for me, my merch has been somewhat basic. In fact, I'm wearing one of my t-shirts from last year right now. You have to endure the times that your first video gets six views that you posted on Reddit and they say shut up and then an auto mod bands you. You have to go through that because until you go through that and you discover why you're doing it. You're not doing it for other people. You're doing it for yourself. If you're not loving what you do, then it's not worth it. Huh. So make a channel about something that I'm passionate about. Oh, sweet. I guess I can make the channel about that. Now, how do I grow an audience? How do I get popular? It's all about diversification. You have to have a massive Twitter following. You have to have a massive Instagram following. You have to have a massive YouTube following. Of course, you have to be on Twitch, which is the key platform. But basically, anyway, you can get in front of your audience. You can engage with your audience. It is going to drive those clicks, which ultimately drives the advertiser revenue that you get back from all of these platforms. It's me and Dan playing video games and talking in a funny manner over them. They're not just people who are good at games. They're actually people who are good at online engagement, online entertainment, first and foremost. You have to write to remain stylish. Anything you wear can and will be used to get you in the quarter fashion. The streamer is either very, very talented at the game. The best player in the game is generally going to draw a crowd because people like watching people who are very good. On the other hand, they're either very, very good or funny, charismatic, whatever it is on that side. Oh, no. It becomes more of a show where they talk about other things outside of the gaming world and gaming becomes really just a backdrop and an excuse to engage with our audience. There were those weird Ronald McDonald, like straight to VHS movies, remember those? I'm personable. I'm chatty. I would kind of, you know, when boring things were happening in the game, I would ramble on about, you know, movies I'd watched or books I'd read and, you know, or conversations I'd had and stuff like that. So I think being personable was a big part of that. It's not just getting on and playing games. It's getting on and being an entertainer. You are putting on a show. All right, now let me go ahead and grab the samurai sword that every gym has. Okay, he's dead. To have a larger audience and to have that audience, I think, stay with you. You have to bring something extra, you know. You have to find your niche. You have to find what works and what connects with the audience and what makes them laugh and what makes them keep coming back. Then you got to make it a little more exciting. All right, throw on a hanging bishop. Have everybody in suspense for a moment. I think the real most important thing is is to just get used to being on camera. Like in any sort of performance thing, is get used to talking on camera. You know, my first few videos were terrible. But because I sat down and did it for six to eight hours a day, I just got used to talking and I got over that uncomfortable hump. If you go into Twitch, purely with the expectation that you're going to make money, make a job out of it, have all this growth and it's going to be great, you're probably going to burn out prior to getting to that point. Because there's very little payoff for a long time, right? Like multiple years generally before you really start to see a payoff. And so, you know, those first few times you're streaming, nobody is there. One person shows up every 30 minutes says, hi, maybe, and leaves, right? Like it's very discouraging, I think, for a lot of people. And so you have to be there just loving it. You have to love talking to yourself when nobody is around. You have to love just the game that you're playing, all of that stuff. Because it takes a while and I think a majority of people burn out prior.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,260,2022-11-17 16:44:20
17647," And you have to love just the game that you're playing all of that stuff because it takes a while and I think a majority of people burn out prior to getting to the like profitable point of it. And there you have it. My very own YouTube, Twitch, Discord, and streaming channels all ready to go live. It's a veritable social media ecosystem just on the verge of thriving. So don't forget to smash like and subscribe and visit my Patreon for perks. Also, go to my merch page. And one last thing, stay cool, my friends. This is live stream shopping, one of the hottest trends in China. Every night, tens of millions of people watch live shows hosted by influencers like theia and by the products they recommend. On e-commerce and social apps like Taobao and Do-In, the sister app of TikTok. It's not about only shopping, it's about the experience, it's about having fun. You gotta see 3D, you gotta see in some kind of action, it's almost like a theatre act. The internet craze has taken over China. By the end of 2020, the country had almost 400 million live stream shopping users. China's live stream e-commerce market has also grown dramatically, with an estimated value of $161 billion in 2020. It's becoming popular outside China as well. So, it's live streaming the future of shopping. Live streaming is not a new thing, and China is started in 2015 with the rollout of 4G. And it was first used for entertainment and socializing. Many live streamers perform for their followers or chat it to them, making money by receiving virtual currency and gifts. In the west, live streaming is mainly the domain of avid gamers. In China, it's broken into e-commerce. China actually has a very big e-commerce empire, so it uses these super apps, what we call that. You have payment, you have search of information, you have recommendation system, and you have huge amount of goods available on the platform and as well as a lot of consumers. So, with this advantage, they merge these features of live streaming to make the influencers actually sell goods. Here is a perfect choice, nice neutrals, beautiful prints, nothing overwhelming, and the warmth and comfort of flannel. Traditional TV shopping involves a one-way direction whereby a host introduces a product, demonstrates the things and say call this number or something. But live stream shopping is live. Dad in the cell is a very big difference. They call this different psychology. And live stream shopping is a very entertaining way of engaging someone else. When you shop, actually this live streaming video will continue. It will minimize into a corner and you can buy the items and pay all on the same app. After that, the live streaming screen will just enlarge by itself and the promoter will come back to screen. So, it's like...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,261,2022-11-17 16:48:44
17648," and pay all on the same app. After that, the live streaming screen will just enlarge by itself and the promoter will come back to screen. So it's like very convenient. How about one of China's biggest e-commerce platforms owned by tech giant Alibaba added a live streaming function in early 2016. In the following years, other e-commerce and social platforms like JD and Do-In also integrated this feature. Over 70 billion dollars was a good, was so by a live stream on Taobao and a year's stream-march 2021. Latest surveys showed that over 60% of live stream users in China were watching shopping shows and over 65% of them shopped at least once via live stream. In 2020, live stream shopping got a huge boost during the pandemic. With millions of people were in lockdown and many retailers were pushed online. People during the lockdown felt like there's a need for more social interactions. This live platform creates an interesting environment that these people decides they're actually interacting with you. And then live stream shopping brings in a lot more variety of things that people could buy and satisfy, in a sense of a music control especially during the pandemic. At the heart of this craze are the top influencers who have tens of millions of followers and sub-products worth millions of dollars every night. They often use their stop power to get bargains from retailers which in turn boosts their own sales and influence. So if you think about China's live streaming, you have to know the king and queen of the influences. The queen of live streaming via she is actually having the biggest viewership and the biggest sales volume for a long time on top of our platform. She can sell everything from like Gucci sunglasses, lipstick, homes and cars. One time she offered her followers to go on a Tesla ride with her and she even for once so they rocky launch in her live streaming room for 40 million yuan. The king be Li Jiaqi. He used to be a cosmetic sales before he turned into live streaming commerce and he knows a lot about the cosmetics. So he's the one that will actually put the lipsticks on himself when he's on the show. Top live streamers like Villa and Li Jiaqi have become celebrities in China and earn millions of dollars a year. Although not everyone can be as popular, mid-breaking live streamers like Tiffany Stewart and a good income through sales commissions. If you like it, you can buy it. A lot of successful live streamers are generally very good at communication. They're very good at articulating very simply what a product does.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,262,2022-11-17 16:53:21
17649," A lot of successful live streamers are generally very good at communication. They are very good at articulating very simply what the product does, what the product doesn't do. In order for them to sell, they need to be trustworthy and appear trustworthy. And they need to show in some ways that they're authentic, right? So, for VIA and Li Chachi, they are able to articulate that quite a bit through their body language, through what they say. For example, Li Chachi will always say bad things about certain products. Because to him, there's his honest opinion and sometimes people want to hear that. And so, they seem very credible, they seem very trustworthy. And don't forget, they're also very entertaining and very interesting. If you're familiar with Li Chachi, you want a Guinness record for the most lipstick applications to models in a 30 seconds. So, if you're able to create a lot of bass, you're going to have interesting things that you do. People who may not want to buy lipsticks, but also streaming just to watch what he does. And then from there, you might get hooked to just an e-bann or a tool manager or a tool to the company as well. Live streamers also use sales techniques such as limited time or supply. These sense of scarcity can often encourage viewers to buy. The platform in itself creates and enhances some of these things. Because you see it live. It's something we call social proof as taken over, meaning that, hey, other people are interested, other people are joining in. Other people want the same product and they add it in a chat and ask questions and say, oh, I want this too. What happens then? It makes the whole product even more scarce. But it's not just influencers. Local farmers, luxury brands, even mutual funds have also started their own live stream shows. Working with very top tier live streamers can be risky. It's not necessary that the benefits will end up with a brand. So, we see company executives opening their own shows. And we see like PNG have their own sales room which runs shows every day as well. We also have local governments in small towns to sell their agricultural products. So, the live streaming is definitely transformed the way product owners can think about how to reach their consumers and enables a lot of players to actually sell. The live stream shopping is going global. Merchants in Southeast Asia have embraced this trend. And in the West, Amazon has upgraded its live streaming function, adding interactive features like chat rooms, companies including Google and Facebook are also developing and investing in technologies to integrate video and e-commerce. In the past, the market started to become a part of the market. The future development space and the future are all huge. The future will become a more daily and more complex way of developing. If you look at the numbers alone, their numbers alone, the chassis is number two, you know that they can sell and you know that they can generate revenue. Are they able to sustain it over a long period of time? It depends on how you know very they are at changing some of the things that they do. But you can't expect consumers one day turn into virtual shopping for good. There will be the nature of us that crave to go into the store to touch the goods and actually wear it and see how it looks like and walk around that with our friends. And those things wouldn't be replaceable with live streaming. You could imagine that the oceans are actually the largest battery. You can store huge amounts of energy in the ocean.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,263,2022-11-17 16:57:29
17650," You could imagine that the oceans are actually the largest battery. We store a huge amount of energy in the oceans. The wave of motion can be very deep. It can extend down several hundred meters. It gets to the near shore from about 50 meters. The whole water column is moving backwards and forwards. As we search for ways to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels, some are looking to a largely untapped potential source of renewable energy. In theory, waves off the coast of the United States alone could generate over two trillion kilowatt hours of electricity a year, enough to power more than half of the country. Waves intensify and subside not just quickly as the wind and that means that it can produce a smooth power generation curve. One of the potential advantages of wave energy is that it could act as a complementary source of power compared to other renewables on the grid if it were to be scaled up to commercial scale. For decades, engineers have been trying to convert wave energy into electricity. But a host of technological and financial challenges have complicated their efforts. In the years from around 2006 to 2015, there were a space of bankruptcies in the sector. And this was largely because of a lack of kind of continuous proven projects out at sea with reliable electricity generation. Since then, companies have been trying to develop the technologies that are steady at pace and with a smaller cash burn. But the same questions remain. Can companies develop devices and technologies that actually work? Is wave energy just a novelty or something that can become a major renewable energy source? The sea is a very challenging environment within which to operate a power project. So sea water is corrosive and conditions are very rough. So this means that power projects don't have a very long lifetime and it increases operating and maintenance costs. Partly because of that, many early wave energy projects hit rough waters, such as the Pellarmus Wave Energy Converter in Portugal and the Isla Limpet Project in Scotland. But that hasn't stopped others from trying. Companies are focused on testing projects out at sea, proving their durability, trying to raise capital and bring down cost. The sector hasn't really converged around one single technology design and companies are kind of undersided about which design works best. Finland-based AW Energy is a veteran in the sector. The first proof of concept of the company's device was made in the 90s. After diver, Rano Coivissari observed the strong back and forth movement of a hatch cover in a shipwreck in the Baltic Sea. The waves are generated far from the coastline, so the wind blows on the surface of the water, causing the water particles to rotate. And that rotation extends deep down below the surface and the waves can be very long. They can be several hundred meters long. And as they come into the near shore, this rotational energy turns into an elliptical energy and eventually backwards and forwards that you probably have noticed if you've been swimming on the sea shore in large waves, you're pulled in and out. That's the energy that we're extracting. There's a sweet spot where we deploy. So around 10 to 15 meters of water depth, that's where there's still strong wave energy coming in. After years of research, prototyping and testing, the company is deployed Wave Roller, a 350 kilowatt device in the waters of Portugal. Wave Roller has an 80 meter wide and 10 meter high steel panel fixed to the seabed via a floatable foundation. The panel moves back and forth with the waves, capturing the energy. It submotes in the depth of 15 meters.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,264,2022-11-17 17:01:33
17651," To the seabed via a floatable foundation, the panel moves back and forth with the waves, capturing the energy. It's submerged in the depth of 15 meters, so it's protected from the extreme waves. We generate electricity by capturing the movement with hydraulic circuitry in a machine room underneath the surface. That hydraulic energy we turn to electricity with hydraulic accumulators and hydraulic motors and also our generator. The wave roller has survived large waves at sea for over a year and delivered electricity via an underwater cable to the grid in Portugal. Meanwhile, the company has won a 2.5 million euro grant to work on an upgraded version of the wave roller, aiming to increase the electricity generation capacity to 1 megawatt. The upscale device would have a bigger panel, two power takeoff units and improved software to control the energy production. We have taken into use a very prediction algorithm that tells us what kind of waves are coming into our device. That gives us a few seconds to prepare for capturing more energy and the difference in that is significant. Our future plans are to deliver technology around the world. So I'm hoping we can be working on delivering technology to projects in Asia and also in American contents as well. Meanwhile, Israeli company EcoWavePower is taking a different approach to capturing the power of the ocean. For the company's founder, in a braver man, developing new sources of renewable energy is a personal mission. I was born in Ukraine in 1986 and two weeks after I was born, the Chernobyl nuclear reactor exploded, causing the largest in history, nuclear disaster. I was one of the babies that got hurt from the negative effects of such explosion. I had a respiratory arrest and a clinical death. Luckily, my mother and nurse approached my crib on time and gave me a mouth to mouth recitation with saved my life. I got a second chance in life and decided to do something good with it. Growing up, Anna wanted to be a politician to positively change the world. After working as a translator at a renewable energy company, she decided to change paths. Solar and wind energy were fully commercialized. There were a lot of amazing technologies implemented everywhere. I saw that wave energy, although it's an immense source of electricity, the biggest companies in the world are trying to develop wave energy with no success. And there was kind of a race going on in the world of who is the company that is going to develop a viable wave energy solution first. In 2011, the then 24-year-old inner co-founded EcoWavePower. Instead of installing devices offshore, the company's devices are attached to existing breakwaters, jetty and peers. Our technology is very cost-efficient, especially in comparison to the offshore technologies, because we don't need any ships, divers, underwater mooring or cables we install on existent man-made structures, and all our expensive equipment, the generator, the hydraulic conversion unit, the automation is located online just like a regular power station. This is the EcoWavePower conversion unit that has been operating in Jaffa port since 2014 until 2020. Here you can see how the technology works. Basically the floaters are going up and down and pushing the hydro cylinders which transmit by the gradeable fluid into land-located accumulators. A pressure is being built, the higher the waves, the higher the pressure, which is used to turn the hydro motor, which is turning the generators. The whole system is controlled by a smart automation system, which you can see right here. And in case of upcoming storms, the system automatically raises the floater above the water level and keeps them in the upward position until the storm passes.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,265,2022-11-17 17:05:52
17652," In case of a common storm, the system automatically raises the floater above the water level and keeps them in the upward position until the storm passes. The company has been operating a 100 kilowatt grid connected device in Gibraltar since 2016, which is enough to power 100 households. Currently, inner and her team are working on another 100 kilowatt project at the Ported Jaffa in Tel Aviv. The project will be also the first time in the history of Israel that wave energy will officially connect to the electrical grid. And our goal going forward is to expand it to all suitable breakwaters in the city of Tel Aviv and to supply significant part of the city's electricity needs. Today, engineers and entrepreneurs are still trying to crack wave energy. Globally, only a few hundred kilowatts of wave energy are deployed, compared with gigawatts of offshore wind. But the filters come a long way in recent years, and with the right engineering solutions, this new power source could eventually become competitive with more mature renewables like solar and wind. I would have a lot more confidence in the success of wave energy companies today as opposed to like 20 years ago. But in the next few years or maybe the next couple of decades, it will be more likely to be used in remote locations like islands that are otherwise dependent on expensive diesel power, or out at sea on gas-decommissioning rigs or for powering underwater autonomous vehicles. So, definitely, wave energy can compete with other renewable energy sources, but I personally believe that this is not a competition. In order to have a 100% renewable energy-friendly world, we need all renewable energy sources to work together. So, I would like to thank all of you for your support. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Please tell me. I'm not going to... Please wait. I've covered a lot of companies, I've covered a lot of Machiavellian companies where people play rough. I don't think I've ever seen anything on the scale that Nissan has. I'm just making you a new one. I mean, you're eating it's cold. One of the most dramatic elements was Rivendor Passe's home being raided by court officials in Yokohana. So, Rivendor Passe's journey into the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,266,2022-11-17 17:10:08
17653," court officials in Yokohana. You stand, my man. You stand, my children. I love these and these 16-year-olds. So Raav Pase's journey into the darkest recesses of the Japanese corporate world started when he was the general council, the highest corporate lawyer position in the company. In the past few minutes Nissan has revealed that its chairman has been arrested after allegations of serious misconduct. He was tasked with investigating Carlos Gow. And he was told conduct an internal investigation and get to the heart of the matter. And then along the way he started to notice serious conflicts of interest. He is one of the few people who knows an extreme amount of detail regarding the alleged crime by Carl Scon. And he is now ready to tell his own story on the record about some of the events that happened. My name is Rivinda Pasey. I am the former global general council of Nissan Motoko Limited. And you could say yes, I had a front row seat in terms of what was going on. When Carlos Gow saved Nissan years ago, he was depicted in Japanese comic books as this hero. And now maybe we'll see comic books where he's the villain. In corporate Japan, Nissan was quite an unusual company. It was led for two decades by a non-Japanese executive. Well, Carlos Gow was a hero in the Japanese business world. If you had a global business celebrity in Japan and worldwide, it was definitely Carlos Gow. In a country with few foreigners at the top, he stood out. But over the years, he saved Nissan from bankruptcy, allied with Renault and Mitsubishi, and turned the alliance into one of the most competitive in the world. Yet as the years went on, I think his ambitions changed a little bit. He started thinking about legacy plays. And one of them was to really tighten the alliance between Renault and Japan. And unbeknownst to him, there was a contingent of senior Nissan executives that were really felt threatened by that move. They really thought that they would lose complete control of the car company. And even in the government, there was probably a little bit of anxiety about a national champion in the auto industry following under full-blown foreign control. Carlos Gow was an auto industry leader respected by many in Japan. Now he's in jail. The arrest of Carlos Gow and came completely out of the blue. This was in November of 2018. He was coming to Japan on Nissan's corporate jet for a regular executive meeting. And he was met on the tarmac by Japanese authorities who whisked him away to jail and charged him with financial misconduct crimes. So what happened was that a power struggle ensued inside the company. And somewhere along the way, it was criminalized. By that, I mean that there were allegations leveled at Carlos Gow and about the way he reported his pay to Japanese authorities, the way he handled money inside the company, that in other contexts, it might have been a board action, it might have been handled internally. A number of executives at Nissan decided to take this difference and take it over to the Tokyo Prosecutors Office. And that unleashed a chain of events that would shake the entire auto industry. So after Carlos Gow was arrested, Nissan launched an internal investigation into the events that led up to his arrest. So Rob Pasey was tasked with investigating Carlos Gow. And he was told...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,267,2022-11-17 17:14:31
17654," into the events that led up to his arrest. So Rob Passe was tasked with investigating Carlos Gone and he was told get to the heart of the matter. Find out what Carlos Done did wrong and bring it to our shareholders. Yeah, it's really complicated because you had various things coming out of the weeds. 2018 investigation has started and we become aware of matters in terms of conflicts, actions by certain individuals, that cause some concern because things might not quite be what they seem. So in our story, we really took a close look at Harry Nada and his role in Carlos Gone's downfall. Harry Nada is one of the most fascinating figures inside Nissan. He's also a lawyer. He's originally Malaysian. How do Mr. Hardy? And he had a meteoric rise through the company and became very, very close to Carlos Gone and other top figures. He had a front row seat at all the major strategic deliberations at the company. And when he discovered that Carlos Gone as his final legacy play was going to tighten the relationship between Renault and Nissan, he made a decision to go against Carlos Gone and he became one of the key figures that decided that Carlos Gone had to go. Harry Nada was somebody who actually recruited me into the company. So I have a longstanding relationship with him or did have a longstanding relationship with him. For many, many years, he was a mentor. I had doubts about the credibility of the process right at the start. Harry Nada had a plea deal with the Tokyo prosecutors. Now that suggests he was intrinsically involved in some of the wrongdoing or the allegations of wrongdoing. And it just didn't smell right, just doesn't sit right. So there was a basic conflict of interest. In other words, Harry Nada had to deliver results to Japanese prosecutors to avoid his own criminal liability and he's accusing and leading the investigation of Carlos Gone. Some of the people who had been involved in the original alleged crimes were also looking into the affairs themselves. Revinder Pasi began pointing out some of these conflict of interest issues. And the reason for that is essentially his concern was for the company. If the company's own investigation into itself was compromised that could lead to a very weak position in various lawsuits that it was dealing with across the world. I had discussions with Harry, discussions about with the statutory auditors about these conflicts, discussions with HR about some of these conflicts. Because at that point, we reported into him. You know, at the time everything was quite, as you can imagine, we've got to do this, we've got to do that, we've got to move fast. But when you step back and look at some of these things, you just think, my God, what was going on here? Because me, members of my team, were being placed in immediate danger. Your chairman has been arrested. A representative director has been arrested. They both happen to be foreigners. And then now what we need to do, we're being instructed to do, is certain compliance professionals need to go into properties in Brazil, for example, and retrieve evidence. They've got to do it very carefully, because if they don't do it carefully, they're going to get convicted of criminal activities. And likewise, when a team of lawyers had an Inventory glimpse of these incidents. Now if you don't put your guts on these for nothing,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,268,2022-11-17 17:19:13
17655," Very carefully, because if they don't do it carefully, they're going to get convicted of criminal activities. And likewise, when a team of lawyers were commissioned to go to Lebanon, one of my immediate concerns was why are lawyers from Nissan being sent to go to Lebanon to retrieve evidence? These are just lawyers, they're corporate lawyers from Nissan. You had revelations that a number of executives had benefited from share appreciation rights, and they shouldn't have. I mean, you know, substantive amounts of money being taken by these guys when they weren't entitled to take them. And you do think, yes, how is this going to look later on? It's going to look quite concerning. So that triggered, for me, the sort of assessment that, well, I'm going to have to do something, because up until this point, I haven't put down on paper these conflicts and these issues. So Rob Passe makes a fateful move. He writes this letter to the board, listing every suspicion he has, in great detail backed up by evidence backed up by memos of why this internal investigation had serious problems. He sends a letter to the board and it's crickets. He doesn't hear much of anything. Nothing happened then, often. Nothing at all. Just like it just gone into a black box. And he began to suspect that there was a desire, even at the highest level within Nissan, to kind of sweep these conflicts of interest under the rug. Unfortunately for me, I think, again, with hindsight, people must have thought that this is the nail that's sticking out, and we can't have this. Within three days of me submitting that to the board of directors, that letter to the independent board of directors, I was removed from the going executive conduct matters. I was then told that I could not attend board meetings anymore. And up until that point, I had attended every single board meeting. I was then also told that after eight years of being in Japan, I'd be going back to the UK. It eventually transpired that I'd be the VP of projects and transformation, managing a team of three. So you can imagine what this feels like at this stage. Almost an arbitrary removal from Japan, where I've lived for eight years, had three children there. My family has grown up and we've been saddled there. Having a few months earlier been promoted to vice president at a global level, to being almost demoted. So Pasi was essentially being reassigned to get him as far away from the internal investigation as possible, and also to a certain extent in retaliation to some of the issues that he brought up regarding the internal investigation and harinata. What happened to Rob Pasi can be seen as a series of corporate humiliations. I mean, first of all, his immediate responsibilities were taken away from him. Eventually he'd lost the coveted general council title. But it didn't stop there. Toward the end of his stay in Japan, Rob and his wife were convinced that they were being followed. During that period, I'd noticed that once...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,269,2022-11-17 17:23:10
17656," wife were convinced that they were being followed. During that period, I'd noticed that once driving my car, I'd have other cars following me. First on my notice this was a round mid-march and I was driving. I can't remember where I was going, but this grey van, small van, just literally started following me. And I noticed that there was somebody in the car taking pictures. And lo and behold, we were absolutely being followed, by either by people on foot or other individuals, two or three normally two burly men in a car, different cars at different times following us around. They were following the family as well. And you know, given we'd seen, right seen the Nissan Security Department, behaving a very, very egregious manner with others in terms of following and surveilling, I was very concerned as to what they were doing and who they were giving this information to. Because if they're giving this information to the authorities, you do think, why? What's going on there? I mean, this is just not normal behavior. And this all culminated in a rather dramatic event in the middle of 2020. Who are you people where Nissan had hired a legal team and had obtained an unusual court order from the District Court in Yokohama to basically do a search end of his home and seizure of his, you know, corporate laptop and phone and other documents. If you don't let us in now, we have to break this key. So it's a pretty extreme way to treat someone who'd spent 16 years at the company. These people have all come in. We don't really know who they are, apart from the fact that I've been shown a badge that says the Yokohama Court and they hit to recover a laptop and the mobile phone. It was even more weird because I'd highlighted to the directors that there that certain Nissan executives were trying to recover this laptop and this phone whilst I was still in Japan. And I was very concerned because it had evidence on there that related to misconduct matters and other forms of inappropriate conduct. It was just another form of intimidation, another form of harassment, forcing me almost to leave the company and the country. Because once they'd retained and obtained these items, we were still followed, which again I just couldn't understand or what is the point of doing that. You know, this is not a car company, this is not the KGB. I think it's fair to say that Rob Posse didn't have full battlefield awareness of all the intrigue going on at Nissan. I mean, Harry Nata is interesting because he's both charismatic and charming and one of the most brutal corporate infighters one could ever run across. If the confidential company email, right, you should not have this. If he had fallen into line, he would probably still have his job at Nissan, be paid very well and continued his work. A career that he spent, you know, 16 years building at Nissan is irretrievably broken. It's been smashed to smithereens. He and his family paid a huge price certainly, but in terms of being able to sleep at night, I think, you know, he's come out ahead. I highlighted issues to the highest levels of the company so that they could be dealt with appropriately by those in charge. There was no response to those and there was retaliation against.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,270,2022-11-17 17:27:27
17657," city, American Eagle outfitters, DSW shoes. Beverly's husband died and at which point they sold off their portion of the company, bringing them an enormous amount of wealth in around 1990. Estimates of her wealth were around $90 million. She, for many years, had that pool of money being managed by outside advisors. Her grandsons, in the late 2000s, had both graduated and were becoming financial advisors. She gave them a little bit to work with, and over time, her grandson Evan became the trusty of her entire state. Managing sort of family money is not a conflict. In fact, some ways in wealth management, it's kind of how you get your start. It's kind of the seed that you need to sort of get going in the business. But Beverly started having suspicions that something was wrong probably in around 2016. Well, there were suspicious things, but taken separately without everyone talking about their own experiences, it was hard to really put it together. She had written a check to her caretaker Dawn that bounced. So she went down to her local chase branch to sort of find out what was going on. She wasn't getting paper statements in the mail, so she asked them to print out a number of her statements having to do with her checking account and her credit card account. So we went to the bank and asked for the statements, and she got a whole year and going through all of them, page by page by page. It was there she saw all sorts of charges that she said she did not the rise or didn't know about. I was becoming very, very suspicious. I was starting to look in the money part and that's what bothered me more when I saw that money was going and I was not a big spender. Around the same time Dawn, she starts noticing Beverly's son who lived in the condominium below her came up with Evan with a shredder and started grabbing papers in her office area, including some with JP Morgan Letterhead and just started sitting at the kitchen table just shredding documents over and over. Yeah, they came in one morning, used to do it the back through the back door and they brought this shredder inside and then they went in the drawers in the office and took all the papers and they started to do it. I was very suspicious because I know you don't go around and get in destroying papers. Beverly said that they had done this many times before. That's when she said to me, you know Dawn, I'm going to write my feelings in this black book. And it's a diary and she started writing each day she would write a little at a time. Around the holidays of 2018, the package had arrived, a FedEx package and in it were materials about a venture capital fund based out of the Cayman Islands. Dawn and some other family members take a look at this and they see that Beverly is signed up for this fund to the tune of $5 million over the course of several years. And that was really the beginning of it. That was sort of the tip of the iceberg when it became obvious that something was going on that my grandmother really wasn't aware of this fund. You know, Beverly started to panic. She was got really upset and called, you know, JP Morgan's headquarters in New York and asked for Jamie Diamond. She said she was told someone would call her back but she says that that never happened. She wrote a letter to Evan and Avi and in there she laid out a number of things that were concerning her on authorized trading, the checking account. She had about a million dollars worth of jewelry in a safe deposit box and that her son Bobby had the key to that box and that jewelry had gone missing. All this was kind of packaged in this, you know, five page handwritten of Memantor Will and Trust. They're such an evolving narrative about why the jewelry was taken. The only truth we really know is that the jewelry is gone. But why it happened, there have been a lot of different stories.

17659," Wonderful things and hand it out. And they email that note to JP Morgan to seize all activity on her account. And it ended up setting off a firestorm after that. As soon as they got this email that there was a season to assist and that she wanted to send her money and change brokerage firms, they were actually vacationing one floor below downstairs. They're there right now. The next day Beverly's in her place, the granddaughter's still in her place visiting. Dawn is there and up comes Bob, you're kind of barging through the door. And he's screaming about what was sent to the JP Morgan. They're now investigating them. And he's furious, takes his mother and sort of puts her into a chair, gets pen and paper. And she says physically forced her to write a retraction letter. They were pushing me around. It was a scary time. I was really afraid too. I had to take her to the doctor and she did an x-ray because she was in so much pain. The locks had to be changed, the phone number had to be changed. I really thought we were going to have to hire guards to be outside just for protection. Oh, it was terrible. Beverly brought her case before the financial industry regulatory authorities, usually known as Finra. It took several months' hearings. She sees all sorts of transactions that's going on. Hundreds of them that she claims that she never knew about, never authorized. But yet we're logged to JP Morgan's files as having been direct requests from her. That included the sale of a large amount of Apple stock worth several million dollars as well as all her stock in big lots. Over the course of their time with JP Morgan, Evan and Avi were making all sorts of trading on her account that was generating. Millions of dollars in commissions for themselves in the bank, yet she was not sort of getting any of the type of gains that you would expect sort of an 80 million dollar account in a bullish market to be able to get. They issued a ruling entirely in her favor, finding that her grandsons as well as JP Morgan, they were liable for violating their fiduciary duty, misrepresenting themselves. And they also found that the bank and her grandson, Evan, reliable for elder abuse. Evan and Avi, they were fired from JP Morgan. They issued an award of about 19 million dollars. I reached out for comment and JP Morgan emphasized that Evan and Avi were no longer with the firm in that their actions do not represent the sort of values of the bank. I reached out to Evan and Avi, heard back from their lawyer saying that they disagree with the law and the facts that Finra kind of used to decide the case against them and are seeing if they can have it withdrawn. Her son Bobby wrote her a letter. I said his sons weren't criminals and he also admits to taking her jewelry. And he says he needed it to pay off some bad business debts he had. They never once came up to say I'm sorry. If there had been an apology and some acceptance and asking for forgiveness from my grandmother, I don't think we'd be in the position that we are now. Since the piece came out, we've received dozens of messages from people, many of whom are telling their own sort of personal tales of kind of financial advisors gone bad or family members who got control of in a state and abused those within. It seems that it's really resonated with a lot of people. I keep hearing a lot of feedback about Beverly and how a lot of people feel she did the right thing. You're never too old to stand up for yourself and try to write an injustice. She was adamant that she wanted to stand up for herself. At the end of the day, they did wrong. It's a painful life lesson. You know, Beverly taught them that you don't mess with grandma.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,273,2022-11-17 17:40:38

17663," Frank Lowe Brad G надо It's very important given the nature of the climate crisis right now for the general public to have an understanding of what progress is or is not actually happening. And I think many readers right now, they'll see these hundreds and hundreds of companies making these big bold climate claims. And they would be forgiven to think that, you know, we're well on our way to meeting the emission reduction trajectory we need to be on. And the reality of the matter is we're just not on that trajectory. And a key reason for this sort of disconnect is the use of offsets that aren't doing what they claim to be doing. We have a massive potential for sort of willful blindness. We can convince ourselves of things regardless of what the facts are. And so that's what tends to happen in these cases. It's not that anybody is setting out to commit climate fraud. They sort of walk themselves into a situation and they convince themselves of one thing and that allows them to convince themselves of another thing. But at the end of the day, they're doing something that makes no sense at all. My name is Ben Elgin. I wrote the story about how the billion dollar market for carbon offsets is setting back the fight against climate change. So one of the challenges in reporting on carbon offsets and trying to figure out what's going on is really finding good experts who have been steeped in this marketplace and are willing to candidly talk about it. One of the best people for this is a fellow named Mark Trexler. And I've been talking to him for more than a decade. My name is Mark Trexler. I've worked in climate change for the last 30 years. I was actually hired by the World Resources Institute in Washington to work on the first carbon offset project in 1988.

17664," work on the first carbon offset project in 1988. In terms of defining a carbon offset, that one of the beauties, so to speak, of greenhouse gases, sort of the silver lining of greenhouse gases, you can, when you put up a molecule of CO2 into the atmosphere, it can be anywhere in the planet in seven days. And therefore, if there's an option to reduce emissions on the other side of the planet, and you can do that very cheaply, as compared to doing it in your factory, for example, then why not pay that person, that factory, on the other side of the planet, to reduce their emissions, then you are, in a sense, offsetting your emissions. And the atmosphere doesn't really see your emissions anymore. So carbon offsets have been around for quite some time, and they were actually key with these international climate agreements, such as the Kyoto Protocol, which mandated the wealthiest countries, reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. The treaty was signed on the 11th of December 1997. Decided. The business community, in general, saw carbon offsets as a huge opportunity to comply with whatever policies and measures might be coming down the pike on climate change, much more cost-effective. We've seen a huge surge in companies, making big proclamations about how they're going carbon neutral, or zeroing out all of their carbon emissions. We're going to reduce our carbon footprint to net zero. Unilever is committing to net zero emissions. We can achieve a net zero emissions world. We began looking at these corporate claims of dramatically reduced emissions, and we noticed so many of these companies were using carbon offsets to achieve these aims. And as we begin to look at the carbon offset projects themselves, what we found is that the environmental benefits claimed by these companies are not actually what they seem to be. And as we sort of saw and spotted a number of these very aggressive carbon offset projects, which appeared to be generating inflated credits or bogus credits, we saw a number of them were associated with the nature conservancy. This surprised us. The nature conservancy is the world's biggest environmental group. They have about a billion dollars a year in revenues. And they've been around for seven decades. They've preserved about 125 million acres of land. They've done so many good works over the years, and they've been very strong in terms of working with corporate partners. The nature conservancy has taken a different approach, a very pragmatic and pro-business approach. They will not go out and criticize a big polluter, but they're very happy to work with them. Some might say that, well, that's selling out, but others would say, and those at the nature conservancy would say, these companies have deep pockets. They can help fund important preservation work, and we have absolutely no problem working with them on this stuff. So companies are very warm, and they've partnered with the nature conservancy for many years. And yeah, it definitely lends a sheen of credibility to these projects. Here are 20 nears, this is the business world this year. If you look at, for instance, Disney. It's a sprawling company with theme parks and cruise lines that burn up diesel fuel. They have office buildings and television studios that consume electricity. So these companies are trying to make major, major reductions in their carbon footprints, but it's very difficult to change these fundamental ways their businesses operate. So Disney has been a big buyer of carbon offsets that are orchestrated by the nature conservancy. One of the projects that they buy from is called Pennsylvania Riges. And that's a plot of land. Most of the land is actually about a three hour drive outside of Philadelphia. Interestingly, this land, 3,000 of these acres was actually acquired.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,278,2022-11-17 18:02:24
17665," and is actually about a three-hour drive outside of Philadelphia. Interestingly, this land, 3,000 of these acres, was actually acquired by the Nature Conservancy in the late 1990s. This land was imminently threatened. There was a pending logging contract on this land. So they do what they have done so well for all of these years, which is they go out. They raise money from local philanthropists and they go buy this land to protect it from developers and loggers. And at the time, according to an archive version of the Nature Conservancy's website, when they were proudly announcing this deal, they said these threats have been abated because of this acquisition by the Nature Conservancy. So it's really interesting now fast-forward two decades to earlier this year when they put forward this carbon project. And if you look through it, this land is a key part of that carbon project. And what they're now saying is this land is now once again imminently threatened. 72% of the trees are going to be cut within five years. Now this is just astounding because this land is owned by the Nature Conservancy. They do not clear-cut land that they've bought through philanthropic donations. So this scenario that they've put forward to get carbon revenues is not really plausible. And what that means is when you have Disney coming in and buying these credits, when it eventually lowers its carbon footprint because of these credits, well that won't be a credible or truthful claim by Disney. So this is an organization that truly understands the threat of the issue of climate change and is wanting to do its part to address this. However, in this situation, it just appears their drive, which they've had for decades, to increase the amount of revenues that it can use for land preservation work. Nature Conservancy and many others see that carbon credits as a part of money that they can tap into to further their own benevolent aims. But unfortunately, what this has resulted in is claims of climate progress that just aren't really happening. So the Nature Conservancy defends vigorously these deals and they and others will say, look, our projects are just following the rules that these registries set up. So some would also put some of the blame on the registries themselves because they're setting up the rules which allow these vapid projects to get up and sold. So we've reached out to all of the companies we mentioned in this story including Disney. They didn't want to be interviewed for this story but they all told us that look, we have to rely on the experts out there and those experts they say are these carbon registries that have been set up. Most of these nature Conservancy deals are set up and sold on this exchange. It's called the American Carbon Registry. Now it's the oldest of these registries that allow voluntary carbon credits to be sold. They've been around since 1996. What these offset registries do is they set up rules and any carbon offset project has to follow those rules. But there's this tension that's always there. If the rules are too strict, then it's going to be very hard for carbon offset projects to get up and running. So there's this balance going on where the registries want rules that attract projects but they don't want it to be so strict where it will disincentivize projects from getting listed. One of the challenges with designing carbon offset systems is that there are normally two people at the table. You have buyers and you have sellers and to some extent you have policy makers but but the buyers and the sellers are really the ones with the expertise, with the incentive to really participate hard, make a lot of things happen. And the challenge there is is that both of them sort of want the same thing or they're both happy with the same thing. They're happy with low-cost offsets and a lot of them because that works for their business model. You end up though with nobody.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,279,2022-11-17 18:06:41
17666," They're happy with low cost offsets and a lot of them because that works for their business model. You end up, though, with nobody really representing the atmosphere, so to speak. Nobody's really representing the climate in those discussions. And so the policies end up biasing the whole system. And you end up in sort of a race to the bottom. And that's what we've seen happen. When it comes specifically to the topic of carbon offsets, I am a fan of carbon offsets in the sense that they can help mitigate climate change. They absolutely can. But if we're not going to do it correctly in a way that actually does help mitigate climate change, then it's nothing but a distraction. And after 30 years, you have to start wondering, is it really just a distraction? And that's really unfortunate, but that's where we are. Ultimately, what needs to happen is systemic change. We're sort of nibbling around the edges with some of these different things. We need to change how we produce energy. We need to change how we transport ourselves. We need to change what and how we eat. You know, we need systemic change associated with transitioning to a low carbon economy. A lot of what we're doing today is not promoting systemic change. It's sort of trying to stick your thumb in the dike to preserve the current system. And at the end of the day, that can't really work. You've heard the name by now. This is the Hyperloop system. It can take people hundreds of miles in minutes. The Hyperloop is a series of tubes that would transport people in pods at ultra-high speeds over long distances. This is a remarkable new form of transportation that can whisk people from city to city in a flash. 29 minutes from New York to DC, 30 minutes from L.A. to San Francisco. For years, we've been seeing these futuristic utopian renderings of some cross between a spaceship and a monorail. But lately, the Hyperloop is becoming much more real. It was surreal to be sitting inside a Hyperloop and just even more incredible to actually be like riding down a track in something that was nothing more than a crazy idea six years before. Companies all around the world have been developing and testing the technology needed to propel passengers of speeds of over 1,000 kilometers per hour. But for many, speed is only the first step to unlocking the full transformational effects of a new mode of transportation. Fast is what we just sort of take for granted in the Hyperloop world. It's the network effects that really deliver the benefit and that opens up a completely different scale of economic opportunity.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,280,2022-11-17 18:11:15
17667," We've got planes, trains, automobiles and boats. We're getting around Earth. But what if there was a fifth mode? And I have a name for it, which is called the Hyperloop. Hyperloop? Hyperloop, yeah. In 2013, while riding high on the growing success of Tesla and SpaceX, entrepreneur Elon Musk released a white paper outlining the basic framework of the technology he called Hyperloop. The basic idea goes a little something like this. A tube reduces the air pressure to a near vacuum-like environment. A Hyperloop pod is then suspended in the tube, usually by magnetic levitation. The whole pod can then be propelled forward. Because there's no traditional friction sources like air resistance or rolling friction that would push back against the pod, the Hyperloop is able to move at incredibly high speeds and do so fairly efficiently. Despite its futuristic name, however, the general concept behind Hyperloop is actually pretty old. In fact, New York City's first attempt at an underground public transit system in the 1870s was based on a similar principle. The pneumatic transit system was short-lived, however, only stretching one block and topping out at a rather leisurely 10 miles per hour. While Elon would make some 21st century improvements to this concept, and bestow a very 21st century name, he wouldn't end up pursuing the technology itself, instead electing to focus his efforts on something a little bit deeper, literally digging the requisite tunnels by a his boring company. It would take another billionaire industrialist who dabbles in spaceflight. No way, not that one. Yeah, that's the one. The Richard Branson would make a large investment in the company Hyperloop 1, it would be renamed to Virgin Hyperloop. What we've always been trying to do as a company is show that this technology could work, that it could be made safe, and that ultimately it's something that's happening in the next couple of years, not the next 20 years. Josh Geigel is the co-founder and CEO of Virgin Hyperloop. In a familiar tech startup story, he's seen the project go from a garage to a large-scale testing facility outside of Las Vegas. So we started building the first kind of Hyperloop system in 2016. We've done a lot of work, about 500 tests that we've done on that over the last five years. And what we realize that we need to do is take that technology, show that it can be commercial. So drive the cost down, improve the efficiency, improve the performance. But the key thing is, you know, is actually making it approachable and safe for individuals. In order to do that, Josh, along with Virgin's head of passenger experience, Sarulucia, bravely volunteer to take the inaugural ride. What her and I were realizing is like, we're the first two people sitting in a Hyperloop. The only type of people that have gone through this environment are in spaces, and there we are in just like normal clothes because of the safety of what we designed. Three, two, one, launch. And then once we started going, you felt a bit of acceleration. We accelerated a little bit harder than we would in commercial. Be like a sports car. Yeah. We got about 108 miles an hour on that test. And it's a short run. It's about 500 yards or so, and came to a stop. The test lasting only about 20 seconds and covering only a quarter of a mile at just over 100 miles per hour is a long way away from a true functioning Hyperloop. But as for optics, it's a crucial step for the future of funding. And the number one question we got from investors or from project proponents or just people in general was like, is a Hyperloop safe? And what better way to show something is safe than by actually getting people on it? But convincing investors and governments that would likely be fronting some of the construction costs for an unproven technology is no easy task. First and foremost is the question of safety. Most people don't know how an airplane works, but yet they get on an airplane. They get on an airplane because it's faster than driving. And most importantly, they've probably gotten off of one before. They've seen someone get off of one before. And so what we set out to do was actually show that Hyperloop could be safe with two normal people, not astronauts, not adrenaline junk.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,281,2022-11-17 18:15:29
17668," for they've seen someone get off of one before. And so what we set out to do was actually show that hyperloop could be safe with two normal people, not astronauts, not adrenaline junkies or test pilots or anything like that, two normal people getting on a hyperloop, and then most importantly, those two people getting off. But beyond safety concerns, constructing hyperloops will undoubtedly require a significant capital investment, to the estimated tune of around $60 million US dollars per kilometer of track. So a track from San Francisco to Los Angeles, for example, is likely to come with a price tag over $10 billion. And before large governments are willing to come in in front of those costs, investors who are funding hyperloop development must accept it as a long term mixture of technology and infrastructure investing. Investors that are used to short returns because you're developing apps or something to that effect. Those aren't the investors that really get excited about hyperloop. What you start to see is the people that are looking at platform technologies. So this idea that because this smartphone existed, Uber could exist. So who are the Vanderbilts of this century? And that's the part where you're going to get a lot more knows than yeses. But those people that have the ability, the fortitude, the stick it out to see the game-changing platform here. Those are the people that we're looking for. And since we've done that passenger test, there has been a lot of interest that's really, oh, this is a lot sooner than I thought. Here we go. All right. Let's talk about that. Sorcerer products that we're launching. The Super Mario MZ's was created by твор! So until then, thanks for watching. Let's hope that you guys break in and be stronger. Hey! Can you here ever be interesting for us? Sure! Sorry for a thunch! From a webinar without you nearing May 16, 2018. Alright, so that was quick because we joined the уbravestone Cooperator commercial. What's going to bring us up a more interesting year-end concert in Austin. Thank you! Invisiting the ripple effects of what Hyperloop could achieve, though, is fairly challenging at this stage of development. It's fast, yes, but for point-to-point travel, traditional maglev trains can move pretty fast as well. And outside of China, South Korea, and Japan, even those haven't seen much adoption elsewhere due to the high costs and questionable profitability. The Shanghai Line in China, for example, loses around $100 million every year. Hyperloop companies, however, believe they can offer something different than traditional railway lines. My name's Alan James, and as far as I know, I'm the only guy on the planet who's written the government-level business case for 300 kmh conventional high-speed rail, 500 kmh maglev and 1,000 kmh Hyperloop. It's fundamentally about moving people from where they are, to where they want to go, when they want to make those journeys, and doing it in much smaller numbers. So pod designs for Hyperloop range from 12 to 28 seats, typically. Why are they small? It's because small enables the network to operate flexibly. And a great example of that is the East West strategic route across the north of England, from Liverpool to Manchester to Leeds. So to get from Liverpool via Manchester to Leeds by train is just short of two hours today. It'll probably take you two hours driving as well in average traffic conditions. That result is those three city regions remain three separate entities. Liverpool Manchester Leeds, there's very little commuting traffic between those urban areas. Hyperloop absolutely changes that from the ground up. Liverpool to Manchester is five or six minute journey. Manchester to Leeds is also a five or six minute journey. What effectively does is create a single super city economy. In this vision, the Hyperloop acts a little more like a highway, where pods have fixed destinations and don't need to stop along the way. Meaning you can travel on a Hyperloop network from say Liverpool to Leeds, while the pod behind you travels from Liverpool to Manchester. And if that Metro Hyperloop now.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,282,2022-11-17 18:20:20
17669," Meaning you can travel on a Hyperloop network from say Liverpool to Leeds, while the pod behind you travels from Liverpool to Manchester. And if that Metro Hyperloop network is connected to other networks from the same location, you could travel from Liverpool to Paris or Liverpool to Amsterdam, all without making a single stop. For passengers, for business, for leisure, that is utterly transformational. For high-value freight and logistics, it's equally transformation. But critically, if you do a Hyperloop network at scale, you begin to deliver massively significant carbon savings to it. A multi-regional Hyperloop network could become a replacement for both short haul passenger and cargo flights and traditional ground transportation, both of which are significant cargo producers. One Hyperloop connected distribution hub, perhaps at an airport that is predominantly used for international air freight, replacing maybe 10, 12, 15 distributed road hubs. It takes a lot of polluting and inefficient truck haulage off the roads. That itself means roads gain extra capacity. Hyperloups will still need to use electricity to both move pods and maintain the near vacuum environment and the tube. Proponents of the technology believe that this could be done by using renewable sources, including a combination of solar panels and battery technology that could be used along the Hyperloop itself. But even with all multipliers of time and carbon emission savings that a Hyperloop network may provide, the investment capital required to actually build such a network becomes even more economically and politically daunting. Committing doesn't mean spending billions on day one. Committing means how do we phase it? One company in the Netherlands is working to develop that technology, and perhaps more importantly, the international coalition needed to make the Hyperloop network a reality. So we are here in Europe's first full-scale Hyperloop test facility, where we can already prove every conceptual technology of the Hyperloop. This is Tim Houter, a co-founder and CEO of Heart Hyperloop, headquartered in the city of Delft. And while this testing tube might not seem as large as others, inside is a key technology to create the on and off-ramp type infrastructure of a Hyperloop network. That is a lane switch. That's something we can already test here. You can actually see it here. That the track is diverging from one track into two. That makes it possible to eventually split up the Hyperloop track into two sections. And in that sense, you can create a complete Hyperloop network, but in the end, we'll make it possible to travel for example over a whole continent. And thank Europe for example, with the same ease as you can now travel with a metro in the city. The nice thing about this magnetic navigation system that we have developed is that there's absolutely zero moving components in the track. So for example, if you have to do a lane switch, all you do is that the tube basically splits up, and statically the tracks also split up. And whenever the vehicle enters a switch, it either pulls itself to the right with its magnets, or pulls itself to the left with its magnets. Lane switching on traditional rail requires the physical movement of the rail. Even modern magnetic levitation tracks use lane switching techniques in order to transfer trains from one track to another. And this is a very crucial element because this is the thing that limits the capacity and in the end, the usefulness of the real network. Because the moment that a track is switching, that means that at that moment you are creating an unsafe environment for the trains behind it. So you need a lot of space between trains. Then a high point because you have no moving components in the track, all the vehicles can be much closer to each other. You can achieve a very high frequency and basically have vehicles moving and merging in and out of the network very much like a high one.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,283,2022-11-17 18:24:05
17670," moving components in the track, all the vehicles can be much closer to each other. You can achieve a very high frequency and basically have vehicles moving and merging in and out of the network very much like a highway. For now though, Hart's physical testing has been limited by the size of their tube. Because the test track is only 30 meters long, they haven't tested this lane switch at speeds greater than 20 kilometers per hour. However, the company is working to build a new test site where it plans to increase that testing speed to 300 kilometers per hour. We're now in a phase where we have proven most of the most important technologies in the test facilities that we already have. And we have also demonstrated the viability and the feasibility of a network. If you look at all the top systems that it consists of, most of those are proven systems already demonstrated in lab conditions. So we don't really believe that the technology itself is going to be the biggest challenge. Because for all Hyperloop companies out there, actually building a Hyperloop system requires more than just a good product. We're talking about the safety aspects. We're talking about integration into the environment. We're talking about the social aspects. Do people feel comfortable traveling in such a system? So it's about all these different aspects. And the complexity is really getting all the different stakeholders that are relevant and that they need to contribute to bring this to market. To get them all following the same roadmap. In order to help build this coalition of private and public interest in Hyperloop development, heart in 2018 partnered with other Hyperloop companies from Europe and Canada. The goal was to define, establish and standardize the framework to regulate Hyperloop systems. Right now we are working with all the Hyperloop developers together in setting up the first structure for starting the standards drafting. One of the most important goals for heart is interoperability, which is essentially making sure the different systems can communicate with each other. Interoperability is so important. Because what we want to achieve is actually have this seamless travel experience. So you don't want to end up, for example, going from Madrid to Paris and then switching because you need to use a different technology to get, for example, to Amsterdam. The idea being that as companies around Europe create the first commercial Hyperloop tracks between individual cities, one day those can all be connected to a larger network. Everyone that believes that Hyperloop is a future transport system also realizes that there is a need to have this network because that's where Hyperloop thrives. Hyperloop is such a huge project. It's definitely not something that you can do in your own or as a single company. So you need to do it with a lot of other companies. You need to have the governments. I think in that sense the biggest challenge that we've encountered is to really get all the required parties together to take the steps in development and in commercial implementation. Hearts Next plan is to build the European Hyperloop Center, an open testing facility which will include a 2.6 kilometer test track. And the company hopes to test travel speeds there at up to 700 kilometers per hour. Virgin Hyperloop is also racing to construct the first commercial Hyperloop route with projects in various states of development in India, Saudi Arabia, and the United States. Recently the company announced plans to build a Hyperloop certification center in West Virginia, which will include a 6 mile long test track. Proving the technology here will be crucial if Hyperloop networks can find a home among infrastructure investments that the Biden administration hopes to make. The idea that there's multiple Hyperloop companies is a redeeming aspect in the business.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,284,2022-11-17 18:28:25
17671," among infrastructure investments that the Biden administration hopes to make. The idea that there's multiple hyperloop companies, I think is a redeeming aspect in the business. People really want to see something happen, so having multiple people move forward is good for that. I was struck when Josh and Sarah rode the pod. Two or three of the major outlets used the phrase, we now have a new mode of transport. And although all of that technology had existed before those two human beings rode it, it was the moment at which those two human beings traveled that short distance down the tube that in popular imagination hyperloop became a mode of transport. The metaphor I use with my team is that, you know, the Wright Brothers refers but none of us fly on Wright Brothers Airlines anymore. If you don't continue to innovate, you're not going to be around and so we'll continue to be at the forefront of building our group. Back in 2013, Elon had an idea. I think the difference now in 2021 is some brilliant engineers have spent real time grinding out the details. And I thoroughly expect the next three to five years to be decisive. This week, how hydrogen can transform our energy usage. We'll look at why the universe's most abundant element could be a game changer in the climate revolution. Hydrogen technologies are not new. They are used in other sectors. We use them in space on our rockets. And we don't need the laws of physics to change to be able to use hydrogen on our planes. From iron ore to green hydrogen, one of Australia's richest men tells us about his pivot to sustainable energy. Let's take action. It's practical. It's implementable. Let's do it now. Plus, the hydrogen revolution. We'll speak with the CEO of Italian Utilities firm, Stan, about his new book and how green hydrogen could be competitive within five years. Coss are coming down and people are waking up to the fact that it's the only way to decarbonize certain sectors.

17672," Hydrogen could be competitive within five years. Cossacks are coming down and people are waking up to the fact that it's the only way to decarbonize certain sectors. From Bloomberg's Global headquarters in New York, I'm Kayleigh Lyons and this is Bloomberg Green. It's a new year, so here at Bloomberg Green we're highlighting new solutions in the fight against climate change. And one of those is as old as the universe itself. Hydrogen. It's the simplest element around, but could well be a game changer when it comes to turning around our dependence on fossil fuels. Today, hydrogen is used in the chemicals industry to produce petroleum products. It's also starting to be used in steel production and industry under a lot of pressure to decarbonize. But it has far more uses as well, from power and cars to heating our homes. And Bloomberg New Energy Finance sees a seismic shift in the sector in the next ten years as green hydrogen squeezes out dirtier alternatives. So-called grey hydrogen dominates today. But as renewable electricity gets cheaper and more accessible, so we'll green hydrogen. In this week's edition of Bloomberg Green, we'll explore what this push into hydrogen means for tackling climate change. We'll hear from Australian billionaire Twiggy Forest about his pivot from Iron War to hydrogen, and we'll also speak with the CEO of Italian utility companies Snam about his book, The Hydrogen Revolution. But first, what are we using hydrogen for? And why does it actually matter? Christine Lee Edwards explains. Hydrogen. The most plentiful element in the universe. On Earth, we find that mostly bonded to oxygen in the form of water. Or in other gases known as hydrocarbons. Hydrogen gas, H2, burns hot and clean, making it an attractive tool in the race to net zero. But isolating hydrogen from other elements is no easy task. Today, the cheapest way to do this is via chemical processes that break up natural gas. This releases a lot of carbon dioxide. Another method is to use electricity to split water molecules in a process called electrolysis. Although there is no carbon byproduct, a lot of electricity is needed. And if this power comes from burning coal or gas, it negates the zero emissions goals of using hydrogen to begin with. Hydrogen produced in this way, powered by fossil fuels, is called grey hydrogen. If carbon capture and storage is used together with fossil fuels, then it becomes blue hydrogen. Nuclear power is used, it's called pink. And finally, green hydrogen is what is produced via electrolysis and powered from renewable sources. This method is considered emissions free. It's predicted that by the early 2030s, H2 made from renewables will be cheaper than that made from fossil fuels. But that hinges on the cost of electrolysis declining, which will be achieved through larger projects and an expansion of manufacturing. To be clear, vast amounts of H2 are already used today. Global production in 2018 totalled 117 million metric tons. This hydrogen is mostly used for its chemical properties, not as a source of energy, and very little of it is clean. Some sectors like steel could start using hydrogen for these chemical properties, replacing coal. Industries like cement and glass may also use hydrogen as a source of heat. Their advantage is its energy storage potential. It can be stored over long periods of time, and used when more power needs to be added to the grid. It also could hold an advantage over batteries and heavy transport and shipping. The promise of hydrogen for energy has been around since at least 1874. When Jules Verne wrote about it in his book, The Mysterious Island, but the future of hydrogen will depend on policy. Companies with net zero targets, carbon pricing and hydrogen strategies with investment mechanisms are likely to see the highest H2 demand. That was Bloomberg's Christine Lee Edwards explaining what hydrogen needs for the energy transition. But how are businesses approaching the sector? Well one of Australia's richest men is making a big play into hydrogen. The hydrogen for is better known as Twiggy.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,286,2022-11-17 18:37:07
17673," the energy transition. But how are businesses approaching the sector? Well one of Australia's richest men is making a big play into hydrogen. Andrew Forrest's better known as Twiggy made his fortune from iron ore, being the chairman, former CEO and major shareholder in Fortescue Metals, one of the world's biggest miners. But after having made over $10 billion in profit from the metal in the last fiscal year, Twiggy wants to transform Fortescue into a clean energy company. He's been scouring the planet in search of investment opportunities in hydrogen and renewables. The firm plans to allocate up to 10% of its annual profits for green energy investments and his exploring projects across the globe from Indonesia to Argentina. Francing Laquah caught up with Twiggy Forest. There's only one type of plant hydrogen. All the rest is dirty. That is green. If you just say green hydrogen is clean, the rest is dirty then you've actually nailed it. Anyone else who produces any other hydrogen, any other agridist, looking there and saying, why is global warming accelerating if anything you're saying is true? And then you know, actually it's greenwashing. Yeah, but there's a lot of greenwashing because I keep on being told it's a transition. We can't just make the transition at a click of a finger. So what are we doing wrong? What can we do better? I don't remember the personal computer having to transition the typewriter. I really don't remember that. I don't remember the smartphone having to transition the pocket calculator and the old landline. You know, it's transition line is complete rubbish. The light got hooked to it. Two days ago when JCB, a really loved British company, every right for the country to be proud of JCB and Portuscue, holding a bit of a similar reputation, fantastic track record and both from Superwell from Portuscue, huge balance sheet, super strong. And those two companies got together and agreed at 79 billion USD on Green with Per Adam. Right. Then that's a real wake up call to say, hang on. Greenhagen is obviously commercial now. You know, every other form of fossil fuel, fossil fuel hydrogen, you know, it can compete with it on price. It can probably lose on price. But what we know, it is cooking the planet. And only Greenhagen zero methane, zero carbon in the supply chain. Don't worry about the molecules in the supply chain. But at the moment, we're not even facing out call if you look at the G20 company case. So we have a long way to go to talk about only using green hydrogen. Yeah. So look, I have a call, which I'd like to make now, that the world should not fund any more coal-fired power stations, coal mining projects ever. We should wind them down as quickly as possible because they are cooking the planet just like grey and greenhagen, it's cooking the planet. No. You know, hydrogen should not make renewable electricity, it's releasing 10 to 16 times more carbon. Let mine the methane, which is worse than it is hydrogen. So we've just got to stop doing things which are self-harming under the guise of green motion. So why are leaders so slow, even if you look at the appetite for eSG investments, they're growing exponentially, so are emissions. So where are we allocating capital? OK, so take the recent G20. There was probably a reason why there wasn't strong action coming out of the G20 because people were not aware that major transactions between large companies were taking place now on greenhagen. That actually this pollution-free order of supply chain fuel was now being transacted at a multi-billion dollar scale. If they had known that I don't believe any sovereign leader or any energy minister or climate change minister could not take ultra-seriously, that greenhagen is never here to stay, it's broken through, the history has been made, it will never go back. OK, what is the one thing that you would tell leaders today and business leaders? How do we transition faster than what we are now? Because we're at real risk of missing our targets. So that's really simple. Do you stop funding? Do you stop subsidising? Do you stop using money into possibly? Right. It could be carbon sequestration, it could be fuel rebates, it could be anything. But hundreds of billions of dollars getting ashed while we ash the planet on fossil fuels.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,287,2022-11-17 18:41:32
17674," Billings does getting ashed while we ask the planet on fossil fuel subsidies because we haven't had that renewable energy, we haven't had that green hydrogen, it's kind of been pushed down, it's down, it's also excuses, oh never be commercial, it never be supplied into quantities we needed, and I'm glad I've got it. Now we know it, let's take action, it's practical, it's implementable, let's do it now. Okay, if we do it now, is there going to be a shock to the energy system? Is there going to be a shock actually to economically and is it worth not talking about transition, just going from 8 to beat? Yeah, it's a fantastic person, 8 to b is the solution, let fossil fuels do what fossil fuels do, just burn their coal, burn their oil, burn their gas, at least they're pumping up carbon and methane into the atmosphere, honestly. Well, not that honest because they don't mention methane which is 90 times worse than carbon, but at least the carbon is being done honestly, encourage the green hydrogen sector to come in really fast, okay, it's there, there's there's renewable power all over the world, we know how to make electrolyzes much cheaper, what do you buy percent of the original cost, we know how to do that now, we don't have it, it's squeezed to get into. Does it need to be cheaper than oil and fossil fuel for it to be viable worldwide? Well right now it is, okay, so let's just swallow that bit of financial data, right now it is cheaper and it's getting more cheaper, it's, it's the only fuel you know, it's declining in value. You don't have enough of it, right, to power the world. Ah yes, that's only because we haven't had policies to support, we had policies to support it five, ten years ago, it would be everywhere, you'd see the global warming budget start to come down. Now we've got five or ten years to make a huge difference and he policy leaders all over the world to appreciate now, okay, big business is transacting with green hydrogen in multi-billion dollar agreements, we now know it's here and it's here to stay, it's spread everywhere. Coming up on the program for hydrogen revolution, we'll speak with the CEO of Italian utility firm Snam about his new book and why he thinks green hydrogen will be competitive in just five years. Plus how are airlines working to become more sustainable? We'll look at how Airbus plans to step up in the climate fight.

17675," music Some Bloomberg's world had quarters in New York. I'm Kayley Lines and this is Bloomberg Green. What will the world look like in 2050? Will global temperatures have stabilized? Electric vehicles be abundant and solar and wind power homes around the world? According to Marco Alvera, the CEO of Italian Energy Company Sam, that vision of the future could be a reality. And he says that hydrogen will pay its way. As he tells it in his new book, The Hydrogen Revolution, Alvera's moment of reckoning came in November 2018 when he tasked the Sam Senarios team with studying how Europe could reduce its CO2 emissions to zero by 2050. Looking through the results of the study, Alvera said he was struck by how much hydrogen was in Europe's energy mixed by that year. Beyond the abundance of hydrogen, the Sam model also predicted that it would be the cheapest form of decarbonized energy for many sectors and that it could be cheaper than today's prices for oil, coal and nuclear power. Our Maria today is spoke with Alvera at COP26. It's happening all very fast. We see the cost of hydrogen coming down a lot. Hydrogen will play a big role in the energy mix. I don't know if it's going to be 15 or 25% of a fully decarbonized energy system, but it's going to be big. Cossera coming down and people are waking up to the fact that it's the only way to decarbonize certain sectors, so called hard to obey sectors. And you say it's the only way in the cost of coming down. Where do you see prices moving? Because a lot of the reticence of times has to do with the pricing. That some argue is still not the cheapest option out of the market. So when I was first working in hydrogen in 2004, it was costing $1,000 per megawatt hour, $2,000, $600. Today, $100, and we see it going down to 50 in five years' time, and to going down to $25 per megawatt hour in the next 10 years or so. Which is a quarter of what is today. That's really because renewable energy, and we're talking green hydrogen here, renewable energy costs are falling, but the cost of making the electrolyzer, which is the kit that you use to convert solar or wind energy and water into hydrogen, the cost of this kit is falling a lot because it doesn't really exist on an industrial scale. So as we build up capacity, we industrialize it, we standardize it, and we squeeze costs out. That's really the cost trajectory. And for that, of course, you need demand, however, for governments and also institutions to kind of buy into this idea that it is a future we want to invest in creating infrastructure. What are they telling you? When you speak to governments, when you speak to officials, are they keen on this? They're very keen, so the Department of Energy shares our view in the states of getting to below $1 a kilo, which is $25 a megawatt hour. The European Union has a hydrogen strategy, which is very clear, and several member states have the same. Chile wants to export a lot of hydrogen. China's big on hydrogen. Australia's very big on hydrogen. Japan is blending already hydrogen. So I would say the world is now really focused on this because it's the only way to store energy for a long period of time economically, is to convert it into either a liquid or a gas. And of course, you talk about the price, but the other big component is the volume, you know, how big can you go? Where do you see that on a time scale? So wherever it's sunny or windy, you can produce very cheap hydrogen eventually. And so compared to oil and gas, which are concentrated in a few parts of the world, it's going to be very democratic from that point of view. So every sunny place, every desert, every ocean wind can be turned into hydrogen that we can put on ships in pipes and really start trading it around the world. So it's going to happen a lot faster than a lot of people think. So, and we say a lot faster? What is that in time? As they said, $50, which is essentially oil parity within five years, and then depending on how quickly we ramp it up after that, we could get to $25, which is coal parity before the end of the day. And in big scale. In big scale, because once you get to coal parity, that's the only way we're going to get China and India to stop burning new coal. We have businesses in China and in India, and I see a lot of hydrogen development, a lot of renewable development in both countries. The Indian announcement was incredibly strong on 2030. Some people were upset about the 2017 at 0 deadline, but when it comes to 30, he announced a big, big commitment to get the 50% renewables. Where is the price? Buy it. I'm surprised that they would make...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,289,2022-11-17 18:50:19
17676," 30. Some people were upset about the 2017 at zero deadline, but when it comes to 30, he announced the big big commitment to get the 50% New Year's. I was surprised that they would make it so explicit and even the net zero is a big thing for them. And so I think it will happen faster than 2070 because of the falling cost of renewable and hydrogen. India's burning 80 gigawatt of oil of diesel to keep the lights on. So there's an immediate opportunity there and we're very interested in working that country. And with regards to China, perhaps the fact that we haven't really seen them act if I guess the diplomats are working on this, but we haven't really seen the leadership. It's going to be technology, it's going to be industry. I think China has committed to a net zero which is very important. At the G20, China was clearly behind the one and a half degrees. So I think a lot has been achieved between the G20 and COP. And I think what's really important is to see in the coming years, how quick it's in our hands to make part of this happen in five years or could otherwise happen in 15-20 years. It's about building the project. The capital is there. We saw how many trillions of dollars are already committed. What's missing is really the projects and that's where companies like us step in. Marco Alvera, CEO of Snam there speaking with our Maria today. Let's turn now to the aviation industry. It's a big contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions and it's under pressure to change that. In October, the International Air Transport Association, a trade body representing airlines, approved a target of achieving net zero emissions by 2050. To achieve that, many airlines in the US and Europe are looking to buy sustainable aviation fuel made from renewable sources like used vegetable oil. Initiatives like these are pushing plane makers to come up with some radical new aircraft that will eventually cater to our growing appetite for travel without hurting the environment. We took a look at how Airbus, the world's number two aircraft manufacturer, is stepping up to the challenge. How long until we can fly emission free? Airbus says it's more confident by the day it can be done by its 2035 target. Airbus a CEO spoke about its ambitions for hydrogen-powered planes and the company's summit in France. The physics works. Hydrogen technologies are not new, they are used in other sectors. We use them in space, on our rockets. And we don't need the laws of physics to change to be able to use hydrogen on our planes. So every day we become more confident. But we think we need to have a plane, we need to have the right fuels, the hydrogen available in the right quantity at the right place at the right time. And we need the regulations to be ready. So we really need the work and the collaboration of many people on the globe to make it happen on time. But it could be a long wait until green passenger jets go mainstream. Large aircraft with more than 150 seats are not expected to feature globally until about 2050. That means manufacturers and airlines today are undergrowing pressure to ramp up short-term innovations to cut their carbon. In a long term, meeting the ambitious plans for so-called green hydrogen means building a giant industry almost from scratch. To make that happen, British airline easy jets as among those saying governments need to get involved and fast. Aviation's emissions over the last three decades leading up to the pandemic grew by about 80% to over 1 gigaton. And that's projected to double by 2050. According to Bloomberg, NEF, about half of the airlines with the largest global market share have set net zero targets by that same date nearly three decades away. Coming up from Blue Sky projects to the bottom line, we'll speak with our Bloomberg NEF expert Meredith Annex and dig into their models about how hydrogen fits into the future energy mix.

17677," Sir, we're here. R zum nochy. Come look over there and sit down. How about us? At the theatre. Yes, dressed up nice. allocated. To bring out your clothes. grasses. workshop. V From Bloomberg's World Headquarters in New York, I'm Keeley Lines, and this is Bloomberg Green. Now let's bring in Meredith Annax. Our Bloomberg N-E-F Hydrogen Specialists to talk more about how hydrogen could change the energy landscape. So Meredith, what place do you think hydrogen is likely to have in the future energy mix globally? Hydrogen is this incredible solution for us as we look to decarbonize because it's a perfect solution in areas that are hard to electrify. So we're really like to think about hydrogen playing a role. It's in things like heavy industry, especially where you need a feedstock as well as energy source. And in things like dispatchable power, long-called transport, maybe even shipping and aviation. That sounds great that it can be used for such diverse industries. At the end of the day though, how much is this going to cost? Well, that's the amazing thing about hydrogen because depending on how you make it, it can actually see significant cost of clients in the future. So when we're talking about clean hydrogen, we're usually mean green hydrogen produced for renewable electricity. And in that case, your hydrogen is almost as cheap as the renewables that are used to make it. So if you're in a place with really good renewable resources, you'll be able to have cheaper hydrogen. But even in places with less good resources, we think that hydrogen can be cheaper than a dollar per kilogram, which is the price of unabated hydrogen today and around $8 per million BTUs for those who prefer to think in energy units. And that can be changed anywhere in the world by 2050, we believe. All right. So let's talk about kind of the pros and cons list. I don't know where cost fits into that. But what are the advantages to hydrogen over other renewables and then what are the drawbacks? Yeah. Main advantage is the fact that hydrogen can serve roles that electron struggle with. And that's things like seasonal storage, for instance, or just anything where you need to store ability, where your electrons are harder to store, hydrogen is going to be easier. That also leads to a downside though, because hydrogen is less energy dense than the usual things that we use for storeable energy today like coal or oil or natural gas. So you will need more volume of storage to handle the same amount of energy. Let's talk about the viability as well and how it may differ in different geographies. What is your view on that? Yeah. So for green hydrogen again from renewable electricity, really places with the best renewable resources, things like Latin America or the Middle East, even southern Europe have really, really good potential for producing hydrogen. And then when you're looking at blue hydrogen, which is produced from natural gas or coal with carbon capture and storage, we do see that becoming more expensive than green hydrogen in the future, especially as renewable electricity costs come down. But that can be a viable option in places like the US Gulf Coast or Russia, where you've got good geological storage for the carbon, as well as ample natural gas that's quite cheap. All right. Great breakdown. Thank you so much to our Meredith Annex, our Bloomberg NEF Hydrogen Specialist.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,291,2022-11-17 18:59:32

Earlier in the day, we've got UC Berkeley suspending its stadium naming rights deal with FTX is according to coin desk citing confirmation from the university's athletic department. The S&P Nezdak, they are both on the side right now. S&P 500 index down nine. Drop now with three tenths of 1%. We've got the Dow up 22. Nezdak in the red by eight down by about 1%th of 1%. Treasuries of slumping stocks appearing declines as creators recalibrate their expectations in response to the Fed indicating that it will continue to raise rates to temp down on inflation. Rising markets and the Fed's response that question this morning for Liz and Saunders, chief investment officer at Charles Schwab. If anything, we may be experiencing since August when Powell first made his comments at Jackson Hole, almost a Fed call where Fed speakers, federal open mouth committee as we jokingly call it, have to step in and push back against looser financial conditions and any narrative that is starting to brew around a cause is imminent here. Yep, come here. There's two. We've got the tenure yielding 3.78%. The two year 4.45%. Spot cold 1761. The ounce down seven tenths of 1%. West Texas, intermediate crew down 3.8%. 82.30 for a barrel of WTI. Lots going on in terms of earnings today. This morning we heard from Macy's. Look at that stock rip hire up now by 14.7%. Coals after earnings this morning up by 4.1%. And even as it withdrew its prior full year guidance, Cisco systems after earnings up 4.7% in video after earnings down by 7 tenths of 1%. I'm Charlie Peloton, that is a Bloomberg business flash. Never tangled at all. All right, Charlie, thank you so much. All right, let's get to it. Let's get to the Market Drivers Report. That's at the business week agenda on this Friday's e pretty good anchor and market score is spawned. You're up to the American Interactive Poker Studio and the Magic Detangler, Michael McKee, International Economics and Policy Course Monitor Bloomberg News also with us as well. Mike, I do feel like I need to start with you. Not just, well, I'm going to tell you, Creedy. He untangled my ear buds, so he wins today. That gets me to get to the job first. What a kiss up. It works, it works, I'm easy. But I do feel like we are driven day to day Mike by Fed Commentary. So we heard from what Mr. Bullard today. Mr. Bullard today. Yes, I mean, well, we sort of bounced back and forth between crypto and the Fed. This is true. It's like a couple changing channels. One wants to watch one, one wants to watch the other. How's lives at Beverly Hills? No, we're going to watch sports channel. Last night, Chris went on a crypto on TV. That's what I got to figure out. Kardashians? No, I don't know. Last night, Chris Waller from the Fed came out and made news because he said he's one of the biggest hawks and he said I could see us stepping down to 50 basis points. And to that, his St. Louis buddy Jim Bullard came out today and said, hold my beer. And it was really sort of an academic thing. And this is where Wall Street gets a little off track is Bullard likes to talk about academic ideas. He did a simulation of what a worst case scenario would be if inflation didn't go down and said that the Fed fund's terminal rate could get to 7%. You might need to go that high. And of course, he said, I think we need to go at least to 5%, 5%, 4%, but Wall Street ran with the 7% thing. And I think one reason is because Bullard has been the first to bring up unpleasant truths in recent years. And he was the first to suggest they might do 75. So people are trying to read into this, oh boy. So he's been right. Yeah, he's been right sometimes. And he does show his work as an academic. And that got people worried today. Doesn't mean they're going to go there. And like I said, he went to 5 and a quarter, which is just about where Fed fund futures are trading the peak rate. So. Right.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,293,2022-11-17 19:07:59
17680," worried today doesn't mean they're going to go there and like I said he went to five and a quarter which is just about where FedFund futures are trading the peak rate so not sure where this goes from here. At least in the equity market Crete Goopda they don't seem too worried right now or they seem less worried than they were earlier today because we did see lows of more than 1.3% on the S&P 500 but we're only down two tenths of 1%. What gives? Well, clearly losses have been paired a little bit. I would say all things to one name that's Apple it's moving the entire market if you look at the index contribution right now of the S&P 500 40% of the move that you've seen from those session lows that Tim just mentioned to the near session highs I'll say has come from Apple so that I think is going to be a significant player. Not that I actually see. About 7% of the S&P 500 right and it's about almost 14% of the Nasdaq one. Right so obviously the major major player what's interesting is though that there aren't actually any headlines to support it. I was looking at what happened today. Nothing actually happened with Apple but it is the game changer and I think it's important to keep in mind because you do have other major tech companies before and after the bell that have contributed to the tech narrative Apple can kind of serve as that poster child for that but Fed speak was absolutely driving the trade this morning and I think there seems to be some sort of narrative shift justified or not that well we kind of knew this all along that what the Fed is saying is that oh well we're still going to be hawkish we're still going to go hard on the situation. I feel like in yields right yeah in terms of yields well I would argue that's where you see the bigger the bigger moves the idea that the bond market you have a 10-year yield that's moving up nine basis points and an inversion on the two's tens curve that's gone now to negative 69 basis points now that's significant because the deeper and deeper it gets the scarier recession that signals. I heard Tom talking about is this like a vulgar inversion like is this something we have to be thinking about going back to the vulgar era. Well the Fed people almost to a person bring up the vulgar era and the idea that when vulgar came in and they raised rates a lot then they cut rates because they thought inflation was going down and it didn't and they had to raise rates even higher again and they don't want to do that again and they keep bringing that up and that's kind of underpins the whole argument of we're not going to be cutting rates anytime soon and we still have to go higher and we need to hold it there and that part obviously from Fed funds trading is it's not sunk in. Can we just quick we've only got about 40 seconds Mike that housing data the Philadelphia Fed business survey like is there anything in terms of the economic data points that's of note today. Not really it's all kind of in the margins I mean we knew housing was in trouble Philadelphia Fed was interesting because prices paid went down but prices received went up so they're paying less for their goods but they're still charging you more so you still got an inflation issue there. Weekly jobless jobs claims are still very low and that was the week that they take the survey for the jobs report for November so suggest that we're still seeing strength in the labor market it's you know it's a tenuous connection but it's one could say we've got more work to do if you're Fed share Jay Powell. I choose to go. Actually Jay Powell I mean Jim Bullard said we've got more work. Interesting today. Were you reading in? I read it this morning yeah. It's part of the job Carol. It's interesting what you said about people what they're what what's paying out because Emma LaGossey who is on is trying to do a kitchen he said it's just so expensive in terms of stovs and he can't even get stuff so it's like we're still seeing that in the system. Yeah just saying all right I guess we got to run now. Michael McKee thank you again International Economics and Policy of course my name is Blueberg News.

The incoming GOP majority in the House mean time likely to mean Congress will drop its bid for former president Trump's tax returns. Bloomberg's Nathan Haker has worn that part of the story. Democrats running the Houseways and Means Committee have been an illegal battle since 2019 for the IRS to hand over it. The current ranking Republican on Houseways and Means is retiring Congressman Kevin Brady. He has not endorsed either of the three candidates to succeed him. In Washington, I'm Nathan Haker. Bloomberg Radio. All right, Nathan. Thank you so much. You are listening and watching Bloomberg Business Week with Carol Maser Tim Stenevich and FTX Man. It's dominated the headlines. Mike was right. It's between Fed speak and FTX over the last couple of weeks. Yeah, and the sudden collapse of FTX is brought back memories of some major Wall Street debacles from the past. But former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers sees a corollary to one company in particular. Bloomberg Quick Take Correspondent Scarlett Foo explains. Much of Twitter is comparing FTX to Lehman Brothers, the failed Wall Street bank that triggered the greater session. A lot of people have compared this to Lehman. I would compare it to Anron. That's Larry Summers, former president of Harvard University and Treasury Secretary under Bill Clinton. He sees a lot of similarities. The smartest guys in the room, not just financial error, but certainly from the reports, whiffs of fraud, stadium namings very early in a company's history, vast explosion of wealth that nobody quite understands where it comes from. Anron Founder Kenneth Lay and COO Jeff Skilling were out front in turning an old-school energy company into a 21st century energy trading powerhouse. FTX Founder Sam Bankwin Fried is an MIT graduate who made a billion dollars before the age of 30. Anron played fast and loose with financial accounting rules using dozens of shell companies to hide losses. We still don't know the full extent of what happened at FTX, but its organizational structure couldn't have been better designed to confuse everybody. FTX is now the subject of both civil and criminal investigations by the US government. And just one more similarity? Now that FTX has declared bankruptcy, a restructuring expert is stepping in and is the same guy who managed a liquidation of Anron. That was a Bloomberg quick-take correspondent, Scarlett Foo. We're going to have more on the advisors who are now overseeing the ruins of Sam Bankman Fried's sprawling FTX Group Empire coming up next on Bloomberg Business Week.

Well, a most read story today in the Bloomberg in fact, several of the most red stores in the Bloomberg today are again about the crumbling empire of Sandbank been freed. What in particular though, Tim, is about the lawyers for the now bankrupt from FTX and concerns about its founder. It's a legal angle to this story. Do you remember yesterday afternoon? We got some headlines on the Bloomberg terminal. They said that FTX was coming out and saying that Bankman freed, Sandbank and freed has no ongoing role at FTX and he does not speak on behalf of FTX FTX US or Alameda. And I made the comment that if you're bankruptcy attorney handling this bankruptcy, you probably don't want to see him tweeting the way that he's been tweeting. And it turns out that's actually the case. We got Stephen Church with us. He's bankruptcy reporter for Bloomberg News. He joins us via Zoom from our Wilmington Delaware Bureau.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,296,2022-11-17 19:21:36
17683, eating the way that he's been tweeting and it turns out uh... that's actually the case we got steven church with us he's bankrupt he reported for blooper news he joins us via zoom from our willington delaware bureau steven were getting some insight into what the lawyers for ft x the case that they're making and what they're coming out and saying in terms of the mess that they have to clean up right now uh... what do we learn this morning uh... we learned the main thing was that the lawyers believe that there was a huge mess that was unprecedented in terms of its corporate controls uh... hold on hold on when you say unprecedented you mean unprecedented i mean we're talking and run world calm like what are you talking here like going all the way let's look at this way uh... in one was probably one of the worst corporate scandals corporate fraud scandals uh... in u.s history among the worst the man who was charged with cleaning that up is now the cio of ft x and he says it's the worst thing she's ever seen so steven is it unprecedented in terms of lack of controls or non-existent controls uh... i think it'd be unprecedented in terms of uh... the week or in some cases non-existent controls is what he's arguing uh... the main thing that happened uh... well to two big things happen this morning they filed two important pieces of uh... two important court documents one laid out the case for why they're in court what the problem is in the how they hope to solve it although they've been in much detail on how they hope uh... the other thing they did was unusual they uh... ask the judge in delaware to prevent uh... the regulators in uh... in bhamas from taking control of the case in any way so does that mean that it ensures that it will be handled in u.s. bankruptcy court uh... no it'll be split they uh... the way these cases typically work is you have a giant uh... conglomerate that's uh... you have a giant business that touches all corners of the planet that's the way this one is usually the different courts work together they get a protocol together and they agree on how to handle creditors how to handle lawsuits we're at the beginning stages of this the bhamas case uh... is is smaller than the u.s. case in terms of the uh... in terms of the entities that are covered by it so we're just at the beginning of it most likely the u.s. will uh... the u.s. court here in delaware will take the lead on that the lawyers in charge of that case have been complaining about uh... the way for c.o. is handled himself so the last few days are you see him on on the stand unlikely i'd out of hill if he will appear in the stand in the uh... bankruptcy case uh... he would obviously be a hostile witness at that point because the lawyers are fighting with them about some of the things that he's been saying uh... more likely you'll see the currency you know the man who's in charge of of of in-run a few years ago uh... take the witness and if necessary or the last next few weeks he's even what happens to spf what could happen to spf that's the question everybody wants answered well we know that in uh... manhattan the u.s. attorney's office there is investigating the company i got a believe that they will look at him specifically so he may face criminal uh... criminal at least a criminal investigation there's no telling whether they'll be charged obviously it's way too early uh... but there's also an investigation in the Bahamas that's going forward as well so one of the things that in the bankruptcy court is very likely to happen is the creditors will turn their sites on him and say what money you got give it to us you cause the problem that's pre-routine in big cases where you have a scandal involving the c.e.o. yeah it's so fascinating um... you know i think about this steven cuz you know initially i feel like in the earlier days of crypto we talked about the ability to avoid regulators and the law enforcement we know subsequent to that that there is way there ways to track it all down uh... despite what we thought was a lack of transparency but will there be some difficulties in maybe understanding the relationships um... among all the entities under f. t. x. uh... and in s. b. f.s. empire or do you do i guess does law enforcement the lawyers feel like they're gonna be able to uncover a lot uh... i would not that against all of the forces arrayed against s. b. f.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,297,2022-11-17 19:25:31
17684," I guess law enforcement, the lawyers feel like they're going to be able to uncover a lot. I would not bet against all of the forces arrayed against SBF right now. These are very good lawyers and experienced investigators on both the pehany inside and in the US side, so they will probably be able to unravel much of it. Now, whether or not there are certain black boxes they can never get their hands on, that's possible. But I would guess that they'll be able to label aim where they think it should be and they'll bring actions in court. Remember, creditors lost a lot of money and so it's in many of those creditors' interest to find cash that is hidden or lies in an asset somewhere. So there's a lot of money backing the lawyers who are trying to get back much of the money that was lost. When you say much just in the last 30 seconds that we have with you, it's hard to estimate this and see the future of course, Steve, and I would never ask you to do that. But what's a realistic expectation that customers could have? I, that's way too early for me to talk about that. Obviously, billions are at stake in this case. We don't even know how much money is actually that regulators and the lawyers can get their hands on. We don't know how much money will roll into the bankruptcy court that the Banker's Record can then distribute. The lawyers said in their court papers, they are collecting hundreds of millions of dollars or they think they've identified hundreds of millions of dollars. Right. All right. Well, we so appreciate your reporting. Steven Church, Bankruptcy Reporter at Bloomberg News, on Zoom from our Wilmington Delaware Bureau.

Not today. No, now it's replaced by like FTX. Exactly, but there is something happening that I think we need to keep an eye on. It's hospitals around the country being at capacity. I agree. This idea of a triple dynamic. We've got viruses like RSV in addition to COVID and then the flu, of course, it's a nasty season. And we're still getting vaccines. All right, we're going to talk about that in just a moment. First up, let's get back to the trading day. Your top is the stories and Charlie. I thank you very much. Carol Masser. We're all on the red right now with the Dow. The S&P has snacked declining treasuries slumping stocks. Also lower traders recalibrating their expectations in response to the Fed indicating that it will continue to raise rates to tamp down inflation. Let's begin with the 10 year.

Nasdaq is down 59 the decline there of 5.10% of 1%. Spot gold 1761 the ounce so we have got the price of crude oil down 4.6% right now at 81.71 a barrel. Brent back below 99.78 right now barrel of Brent the global benchmark down 3.3% natural gas is up by 3.4% and Bitcoin up 7.10% of 1% right now at 16.649. As for the market backdrop the out of care is co-head of investment strategies at Alliance Bernstein. I don't think we're at total capitulation. I mean we think we may have seen the bottom. We feel like we're in a range bound market somewhere in the 3600 to 4000 in the next 6 to 12 months on the S&P. Our base case is for an earnings decline that we have not yet seen factored into the market. And again we've got the S&P right now at 39.38. Starbucks is reporting sales that exceed the expectations as consumers fork over more for their lattes amid higher economy wide inflation driving the shares.

I'm Charlie Pettit and that is a Bloomberg business flash. All right Charlie. Thank you so much. Well the world continues to include covid between now in some parts of the world such as China really continue to be a drag on economic growth and getting back to a more normal way of life. I will say timid does feel like in New York City as I was coming up in the world trade center. I mean there were a lot of people coming off the trains this morning does feel more back to normal. Yeah especially on a Thursday Friday we'll see if that's another story does get quite a little quieter. Hey let's get into it and talk all things pandemic and other respiratory viruses as well. We've got Dr. Coser to lot joining us associate professor of international health at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. The Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health is supported by Michael R Bloomberg founder of Bloomberg LP and Bloomberg full answer. He's a doctor to lot joins us on the phone from Baltimore this afternoon. Dr. Tola could have you back with us. I want to start with this idea of what I talked about just in the tease that right there this idea of a triple-demic right now. I don't know about you but I did not hear about RSV overwhelming hospitals especially in pediatric areas until this year. What's different about this year? Well we haven't heard it quite so bad either. What's different about this year there's a couple of things. The first is this RSV season is much earlier than we usually see it. Usually RSV is a winter time virus we see it filling up pediatric hospitals in January and February not in October and November. So it's much earlier and in addition there's many more cases. RSV season has been altered because of COVID so when we were all staying home and when we were all wearing masks and kids were not going to school, RSV really disappeared for the better part of two winters. Last year we had a big RSV surge in the summer and then it went away in the fall which was really unusual. This year it started in the fall and it's much higher and part of the reason why it's so high is because so many people have not seen RSV in several years or immunity has waned. We have large numbers of babies and young children who've never had it. Now everybody is getting it all at the same time. Yes, scary stuff my cousin has a three-year-old who was in the hospital for five days with RSV who thankfully is okay right now. Dr. Chalott so what are we to do as parents? What are we to do as we head to the holiday season recommendations? Well you know if you're sick stay home if you're tired of sick keep them home from school. But if they're old enough to be wearing masks this might be a good time to be wearing a mask.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,300,2022-11-17 19:38:22
17687," to take over the majority in the House now in Washington and current speaker Nancy Pelosi will she says she won't be seeking any leadership position next year. With great confidence in our caucus, I will not seek re-election to democratic leadership in the next Congress. And Pelosi making that announcement on the House floor she did say she's not retiring so she will continue to serve in the House for her district in San Francisco. House Democrats mean time eager to raise or suspend the debt limit by the end of the year. But now it's looking like that might not happen. We get more than what's happening on that front from Bloomberg Sabin Morris. Now that the GOP has a slim majority in the House Democrats want to tackle the debt ceiling before the new Congress is sworn in. But Republicans aren't very interested in a quick deal. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell says it can wait. Democrats don't want to use the reconciliation process. Not only would it take too long, but they'd like a bipartisan deal. But waiting may be risky for Democrats, as Republicans have said they want to use those negotiations to finagle fiscally conservative concessions. In Washington, I may be more as Bloomberg radio. Thank you, Amy. Watch out for blackouts and other power problems this winter. A U.S. regulatory agency says a quarter of us face grid emergencies this winter. This is the word from the North American Electric Reliability Council. It says New England, the central U.S. from the Great Lakes, all the way down to Louisiana and Texas are at the greatest risk of grid emergencies.

Thank you so much. She's right, by the way, which part? It's a question of whether you want to ruin your weekend or ruin your work week when you get, you know, from the vaccine side effects. I can't. It doesn't hit everyone, though. No, it doesn't. It doesn't. It's not hitting my family. It did, right? Yeah. And so I think about it. I mean, in the past, I think I thought I was doing okay, but I typically have done things like on a Friday night, but you're right. So I can sleep most of it off before Saturday, on my Saturday afternoon. Getting ready to fly. The holiday season? Yeah. Yeah, I'm going to be doing a lot of flying in the next month or so. Looking forward to it. Never. You know what, though? What? The new hack, the new travel hack for New Yorkers right now. I'm sorry, this is New York centric. What? Is to fly in and out of LaGuardia Airport. It is the new terminals in LaGuardia. I never thought I would say this. Or a delight. It's stunning, right? It is stunning. But have you, have there are some gates, though, to walk? I haven't been to those. That you really, you really can add up your steps. Oh, that's really far out. The last trip, where do we go? Where did I go? Oh, I went to Florida. I went to Florida. Yeah. It was quite a hike. You walked all the way to Florida? No. Okay. But you're right. It's, it's a beautiful. So I compared to what it was. You leave some questions about other airports. Like, we're not going to talk about Newark right now, Carol. It's not, it's not where you don't want to fly in. It's not a new Jersey joke, everybody. It's just that Newark is, the airports getting old. It is getting old. Let's talk about JFK. You're a Governor Kathy Hocal announcing today that construction of a new terminal at JFK would commence early next year following a pause in the project due to the pandemic. Yeah. They should have continued it during the pandemic. What I don't understand is LaGuardia, they were working. Yeah. And it was kind of great because nobody was around. Yeah. What a unique opportunity. Come on, people. Come on, man. New terminal six is a privately financed development. It's expected to cost around 4.2 billion, according to a press release from the governor's office. Investors will be developing terminal six in two phases with the first gates expected to open in 2026, the remaining ones in 2028. All right. It's part of a public private partnership between the port authority of New York and New Jersey with a consortium investors, including Vantage Airport Group, RXR and JetBlue Airways that make up JFK Millennium partners. And here's something interesting. The governor of New York saying that 4,000 jobs will also be created in the process.

All right, Charlie. Thank you so much. Well, as travelers get ready, like Tim, to take to the air the holiday season gets underway, our Alan Levin in the new issue of Bloomberg Business Week takes a look at the glamorous air charter market. The dark corners of that market, that is. Is this story, by the way, also the Bloomberg Big Takeout? Are you applying that I'm going to fly on a private jet somewhere for between 40 and $70,000 for a round trip between East Coast and the West Coast? Whatever works for you, Tim Stonemick. I'm not going to be doing that. And especially after reading the story, I think it raises a lot of questions about what the charter industry looks like. We've got Joel Weber, the editor of Bloomberg Business Week with us in the Bloomberg Interactive Broker Studio, and also Alan Levin, Aviation Safety and FAA reporter for Bloomberg News. He joins us on the phone from our Washington, DC Bureau. Joel, I want to kick it over to you and just make a distinction at the beginning of the conversation about how we define illicit charter flights. Because the definition is, it's kind of murky, right? And that's why I think this story is scary, right? Like I think people are getting on planes that they assume are fine. And in the worst case scenarios, as Alan's reporting shows, learning in disastrous ways that they're not. And it is murky. And that's, I'll let Alan actually take the question in terms of like illuminating the very specific question that you have. But the bigger thing to me is just, I think there are private aviation has become almost sort of the shadow world that is very attractive. You can get places far easier. And all you need is a little bit more money than flying via normal one. And it has, Alan's reporting here reveals that it comes with a host of problems and worries. Alan? Yeah, that's correct. And you know, in our world today, we can assume when you get on, if you call an Uber or you get an attacksy, that it's sort of been vetted by the government. It's not perfect, but at least, you know, they're looking at it. And I think that assumption carries over into the charter world. Not least, you know, at least in part, it's due to the fact that there are lots of apps you can get that will get you a charter flight. And some people just assume it's the same thing. But it's, but unless you know what you're doing, it's really hard to tell the legitimate operators from the ones who are not licensed and, you know, in some cases are really cutting corners on safety. I'm sorry. I'm just having like FTX flashbacks. I just say in a world of like, greatulators and like, working here accountability. You assume that it has a fancy app that, you know, and that it has ads that it's going to be okay. So this is really interesting. There's this also this part in the peace, Alan. And you have just some, you know, really heart-wrenching examples. Marcy Wilhelm is somebody you spoke to for the peace. Tell us about her experience flying privately. Yeah, let me just start by saying I've been covering air crashes for a couple of decades now. And this is really one of the most heart-wrenching ones. Marcy is amazing. Had an amazing success story. She had founded a healthcare company and they'd sold it for almost $200 million. It was back in 2018. She'd been hired to be the CEO of the successor company. And, you know, she had, it was going away on a long weekend to nant tuck it with some friends from her house in Florida. They stopped in South Carolina to pick up some folks. And the plane essentially did not have breaks. And it's a fairly big corporate jet with high speeds compared to some other planes. And it just went screaming off the end of the runway down in a bank meant and broken the piece. It was killed both pilots and Marcy and your husband were both severely.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,303,2022-11-17 19:54:05
17690," screaming off the under the runway down in embankment and broken the pieces. It killed both pilots and Marcy near-husband more both severely injured and what investigators came to learn very quickly was that the plane never should have been in service on many different levels. For one thing, Marcy booked the flight on a legitimate charter operator but they're required to put each and every aircraft on their certification. This aircraft was not. But beyond that, it had dozens of maintenance items that weren't complete and most notably the brakes. And the most stunning thing of all is a mechanic had noticed that the brakes weren't working, had put a bright orange placard kind of a sticky note if you will on the brake panel right in front of the pilot's faces. That said inoperable, technically it said inop which is whatever, you know, that's whatever one innovation, no, I mean they should know what that means and they still landed without the brakes and had this accident. How is this happening still in the year of our Lord 2022? Like how and why? What are the blind spots here? So, you know, in the legitimate air charter world, I don't want to leave listeners confused in the legitimate world. There is a ton of FAA oversight. It's not perfect, occasionally we see flaws but you know, they're required to do everything from pilot training to drug testing employees on and on and on. But there's, you know, good 20,000 or so private jets that are privately owned in the US and, you know, say you're a business and you bought this jet and suddenly the costs of maintenance are adding up. You might say, well geez why don't we just rent it out, you know, to somebody and if you do that, you're not following all those safety measures that the legitimate guys do and from the outside of the plane, it's almost impossible to tell the difference. And I guess I'm just wondering why does it all fall through, you know, the hands of regulators or the FAA ultimately, but I can see where the cracks are. So, what's your advice to folks out there who might be interested in chartering? Well it turns out the FAA, partly in a reaction to this a few years ago, be in publishing a list of all the aircraft that are legitimately licensed to carry people for hire. So you can look that up, you have to go to, if you Google FAA air charter safety, you'll find a link to it. There's a trade group that has been very involved in this as well and there are also several private companies that do auditing of charter companies sort of save the customer, the hassle of doing that. And so there are definitely ways to figure out who's legit and who's not. And we teased earlier that there's a connection between JB Fox and a big Hollywood producer, Peter Gruber, also the NBA and I think the NHL. So highly recommend that you check out this story in the upcoming issue of Bloomberg Business. We also on the Bloomberg terminal and at Bloomberg.com because it's a really important one and a lot of detail there from Alan Levin our Aviation Safety and FAA reporter Alan. Thank you. Here at Bloomberg News and our thanks to the editor of Bloomberg Business Reach Old Weber as well.

Bloomberg's comprehensive cross-platform coverage ahead of the U.S. market closed starts right now. This is the countdown to the close. About 60 minutes to go in the trading day, Romaine Bostic here. Alongside Scarlett Foo, we're joined right now by our colleagues, Carol Master, and Tim Senevik. We welcome our audience across Bloomberg Television, Bloomberg Radio as well as on YouTube and Quick Take Carol. Another day of declines here for the S&P and really the broader market as a whole. I don't know. Maybe some of those comments by Jim Bullard putting people on the back foot. Yeah, we're going to talk about that in just a bit. This is why R.A. Don't judge me. Don't throw tomatoes at me. But I continue to look at those Chinese names that trade in the United States. No. Because outperformance once again, they're up about three percent. This one but I like about you, Carol. You're reliable. Somebody you got to count on. All right. So the goal, the Dragon China index up 3.6%. But you know what, Romaine? It is up about 36% since October 24th. So some of the reasons why you've got Alibaba rallying. That is up about 7.5% of profit beat and a share buyback is a big reason why. It's also a big part of that index. JD.com is up about 8% and you've got a buy to also up about 4.5%. So again, when you're looking for outperformance, whether you like it or not, that's where they are, Tim. All right. Well, speaking of reliability, you can pretty much reliably guarantee that among the top red stories on the Bloomberg terminal are going to be about FTX and the continued fallout. I can't look away from the story. I can't look away from crypto. We do look at Bitcoin right now, not moving significantly. It's kind of been between positive and between gains and losses throughout the day today. We'll up half a percentage point among the latest headlines though, SBF and two other top executives at FTX getting big loans from Alimita research. The company's affiliated trading arm.

The company's affiliated trading arm, this according to a bankruptcy filing this morning, and then advisors overseeing the bankruptcy of the company are struggling to locate the cash in crypto. And you guys heard this. The new CEO, John J. Ray III, who oversaw the liquidation of Enron, said that the lack of controls just unprecedented. And who has a great quick take piece on all of this? I do. Scarlett Food. We played that on our program earlier. We just played it on our program. All amazing. I love that. Yeah. All right, well, hopefully we can get to that a little bit later, just a quick check on the broader markets guys, down about 6 cents up a percent on the S&P 500, the NASDAQ indices, down about a similar amount, the big underperformer of the day. You're going to find that with the Russell 2000, Scarlett, down by more than a percent here on the day. You know, you look at the S&P 500. It's only down by half of 1%. But then you look at the industry movers. And what's striking here is that 10 of the 11 groups are in the red. The only group that's not falling today is technology. And it is barely holding on to a gain of 1 1 1%. And that's largely on the back of Cisco, to be honest. And some chip makers remain you pointed out the Philadelphia semiconductor index still holding on to a gain of about 3 1 1% within utilities, worst performers, all 30 members in the S&P 500 are down. And decliner's outnumbered advances by a ratio of 3 to 1 as well. Yeah, some of the biggest movers today, at least in the S&P. That actually belongs to some of the retailers. Macy shares have been a wonderful day. It's been up about 13% here on the day. And Bath and Body Works haven't been in one of these places in a while, but apparently other people are. They're in four paths. You like those baths, Fizzies. I don't know why. It's just like, it's kind of like, it's kind of like, it's so nice, right? Everything's like vanilla and... Vanilla and patchouli or something like that. Those are just the California ones, right? Do you say patchouli? Patchouli is out. I don't know. Jasmine, Lavender. Anyway, about 24% here on the day, TGAX, the rummage sale that Carol seems to like down about 2% on the day. And keep an eye on Tesla shares. They were down about 3% here on the day. On a lot of speculation right now surrounding Elon Musk. I do want to bring your attention to something that's not on the board. GM shares, which were in the red a little bit earlier, now spiking up about 2% here on the day. General Motors raising its 2022 guidance, 2022 here for adjusted automotive free cash flow. The company talking big time about its EV push here and saying that this will be the big driver for the company. GM expecting EVs to be profitable in 2025 in North America, just to walk you through a couple of the numbers here just so you have them real quick. For their full year adjusted EV, but they're looking at 13.5 billion to 14.5 billion. That's a little bit the lower end of that range, higher than what they had given before, the higher end of that range, lower than what they gave before. But overall above the consensus estimates out there on the street. Well, I heard this. I thought it was really curious that it was, GM was giving some kind of pre-announcement in the middle of the trading day. But this is from the company's investor day. Yeah, the company having to invest today. Remember we gave a heads up earlier in the week? Our David Waltz had a story out. That's specifically they were going to talk about their electric vehicle program and expecting that to be profitable in 2025. So we did get a heads up and expected some headlines, but this is more bigger broadly about their market. And let's stay on this for one second, because the other headline coming is that they're playing to build 400,000 EVs in North America from 2022 through 2024. So basically over the next couple of years. But I think the key issue right now with these headlines that are coming out is really the profitability aspect of it. That was the concern. We knew GM had the capacity to produce that level of vehicles. The question is, were they going to be doing it at a loss as most people let it assume that they were? Yeah, and we got to remind everyone that the big player in the room here continues to be Tesla. And in the way it's been under pressure over the last year, as other companies have come in and said, wait a second, this is a game that others can play as well. Century old automakers that have experience building vehicles can also do this. And we're seeing huge shifts from the likes of Volkswagen, Ford, and of course GM as well. That first mover advantage is disappearing very quickly for Tesla. It's been something that buoyed the stock for so long. It's interesting as well when it comes to general motors and this forecast that it's going to be profitable with this EV is that it's perfect in timing with what investors want at the moment, which has shown me the money. Forget about growth. We want to see actual numbers. We want to see actual profits. This is an economy that does not, you don't get a lot of flexibility. You don't have a big cushion. So you better deliver. Yeah, we're going to keep an eye on that stock. Really all over the map right now. But still up about 1% here. Interesting story there. I do want to turn back to the debt markets here. And particularly what we're seeing on the shorter end of the curve, the big selloff happening today.

17693," 100% here. Interesting story there. I do want to turn back to the debt markets here and particularly what we're seeing on the shorter end of the curve, the big selloff happening today, nine basis points higher on your two year yield and more importantly, that two tens in version are really starting to get interesting here. A lot of people saying that they really want to see us get down to about negative 100 basis points on that two tens at one point on the day. We were actually below negative 70 here, so definitely moving in that space here. And this is now less about a repricing of Fed expectations and really about a repricing of economic condition expectations and recession expectations as well. Well, and that has certainly been kicked around bounced around thanks to all of the Fed speakers that are out there and one who has been one of the more hawkish voices out there and out there front and center early on when it comes to inflationary concerns. We're talking about Jim Bullard. He's the president of the St. Louis Fed and he said in terms of rate moves. We got to keep going check it out. Even under these generous assumptions, the policy rates still isn't at a zone that might be considered sufficiently restrictive to get to this sufficiently restrictive level of policy will need to increase the policy rate further. That was Jim Bullard. The president of the St. Louis Fed earlier at an event in Kentucky. What do you have? The most efficient way to do that is to get the new trend. We're not going to be able to do that. But given the long and variable lag between policy moves like this and what ends up happening with inflation, I mean, how do we know when sufficiently restrictive is there? That's why I guess I'm not a Fed governor. My head is spinning from all the Jordan. Really what did he just say? He just said maybe the Fed needs to stay with it. We're not going to pivot. We're not going to pivot. Here's the hint guys, Fed policy and figuring it out. Not an exact science. Yeah. I'm just going to say, all right, we're going to continue this conversation. We'll be back in less than an hour's time. Radio TV, YouTube and Bloomberg Quick Take. We do it all. We're going to get you down to the close beyond the bell at 4 p.m. Wall Street time. You're listening to Bloomberg Business Week with Carol Maser and Bloomberg Quick Take's Tim Stenevick on Bloomberg Radio. Are you on listing and watching Bloomberg Business Week? We'll go back to our TV colleagues to count down to the close. Are you like, I had some like other Fed speak ready to go. I wasn't just bullard today. Get him to move fast. The bullard is an important one. Yeah, he was on the obliques on the blog. Exactly. Yes, that is the important context. He was on the obliques podcast and he basically said, hey, this rally is really not what we want to see. This was the rally that we saw over the summer. Fed officials came out and squashed that rally. Our drive to the close guests we had on yesterday said that the bear market rally that she says what we're seeing right now the last week is a bear market rally. We're going to have a repeat of what we saw over the summer. She could be right. She could be wrong. It's kind of tricky. New Emily Hill. But in the meantime, you know, when I love when Mike comes on and he tells us because we're getting so much in terms of the way of Fed speakers. I mean, we have stories that are constantly just updating about what the Fed speakers are saying. But Tim Bullard is somebody who earlier this year out there in front and center talking about inflationary concerns, talking about maybe the need to start moving, you know, more quickly when it comes to Fed moves. And so when he what he says, I feel like there I'm not saying they're not all important, but some of the Fed speakers maybe get a listen a bit lean and a little bit more closely. You're right. You got to add it up. I mean, what we saw from Mary daily yesterday, a paus and Fed rate hikes was off the table. Right. So there's another one added all up in the meantime, going back to GM real quickly. She's total capital spending of 11 to 13 billion dollars per year through 2025. You know, we talk about capital expenditures. It's important tells what a company fails up a beat or not. That's real material that we can use to assess where we are in the markets. Let's get to world and national news. Denise fellow greenie is in World Headquarters here at Bloomberg. Hey Denise. Yeah, thank you. We're getting word from lawyers of jail WNBA star Brittany Griner. She has begun serving a sentence in a Russian penal colony. And now we're getting word that she is trying to stay strong. So just a little bit of food for thought there as we look at our world national news. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi not seeking a leadership position in the next term of Congress.

17694," With these elections, the people stood in the breach and repelled the assault on democracy. They were soundately rejected violence and insurrection, and the doing so gave proof through the night that our flag was still there. And Pelosi says she will continue to serve in Congress for her San Francisco district. When Republicans control the House next year, they could put the brakes on some House investigations in a former President Trump, but also as Bloomberg's Nathan Haker reports, Trump's latest run for the White House. Well, that could put more political pressure when you think about it on federal prosecutors who have been investigating Trump's for months. The Justice Department has said it's determined to carry on the probes against the former President, but it will now have to take extra steps to shield those investigations from claims of political impropriety. Prosecutors may also want to wrap up their work quickly to make sure any appeals get done before voters head to the polls in 2024. One former federal prosecutor tells Bloomberg News Trump's candidacy will allow him to portray himself as a victim and rally support from his base if he's charged with a crime in the coming months. In Washington, I'm Nathan Haker, Bloomberg Radio. All right, thank you, Nathan, and global news. 24 hours a day on air and on Bloomberg Quicktake. I'm Denise Pellegrini. This is Bloomberg.

Denise Pellegrini with World of National News, Carol Maser, a long-term stanvac on this Friday's Eve, live in Herb of the Burger Interactive or Studio streaming on YouTube and on Quicktake. You can see us everywhere. Sorry for everywhere, and it's freaking you out. But anyway, it's a freaking you out. No, I'm good with it. Also everywhere, though, freaking a lot of people out still is everything that continues to unfold when it comes to FTX. Yesterday afternoon, there was sort of this collective gas that you could hear across crypto Twitter. It's when Vox's Kelsey Piper published an article that included an hours worth of direct messages between the two folks that ultimately Sandbakeman Fried thought were private, but Kelsey's a journalist. Kelsey ended up publishing them on Vox under the headline, Sandbakeman Fried tries to explain himself. He talks about what went wrong, what lies he told along the way, and in the words of Kelsey Butler, why he did what he did. Yeah, it was past. It was past. It was past midnight, Bahamas time where Bankrun Fried is reportedly still located, and we went back and forth on Twitter, Kelsey writes, for more than an hour. He said, still working to try to raise the funding needed to pay back all his depositors. So basically, he was like, hey, how are you? What's going on? And then went back and forth, right? The screenshots in here. A lot of words that we can't actually use. But he says F regulators, they make everything worse. They don't protect customers at all. He said in response to quote, you said a lot of stuff about how you wanted to make regulations, just good ones. Was that pretty much just PR too? He says, yeah, just PR. And there's no one out there making sure that good things happen and bad things don't. The question does seem like some kind of consumer protection would be good. Maybe regulators can't deliver it, but churches look like consumers lose their shirts a bunch. This was coming from Kelsey. SBF agreed on both. It would be good, but regulators can't do it. He did come out after this article was published and say that these direct messages were not meant to see the light of day. But after all, Kelsey's a journalist. Yeah, my gosh, this is why this one is just one for the books. You are listening in watching Bloomberg.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,308,2022-11-17 20:15:57

17696," Okay, Bill and here live breaking news over your Bloomberg type squawk SQUA on your Bloomberg terminal line Charlie Palette and that is a Bloomberg business flash. It is indeed all right Charlie. Thank you so much. Well among our most red on the Bloomberg as you know a lot to do with FTX and with crypto. One particular story is about crypto stocks which we know Tim are way way way off their high. They are but you know one person's lost is another person's game. So Bailey lip-shults is with us this afternoon. He is equity's reporter for Bloomberg news. He has got a great piece out about how crypto stocks route delivers a 469 million dollar win to short sellers. We are talking about companies like Micro strategy, Coinbase and others that are publicly traded have done the short well Bailey. I mean the right place at the right time right? Yeah and we have seen short sellers really ramp up those bets as kind of FTX initially started to fall out. So the beginning of last week when maybe they were going to get bought by finance but kind of blood smelling or shark smelling blood in the water and really kind of leaping on to it. And we have seen that be a very profitable short bet for investors really if you look at it obviously in the last week but even throughout this entire year. Are we seek short positions increase even on these names? I am just curious what are we seeing in terms of the trend lines and I feel like they were fairly well shorted maybe even ahead of it. Yeah we have seen short interest really just kind of as you said be very high or in a market where investors are more than happy to short pretty much anything in the growth space especially those exposed to Bitcoin but last week last seven days almost 93 million dollars of new short selling in these stocks and that is kind of reversing something that we have seen more of covering in the last month as people maybe were betting that the bottom was already in. Are people sending you IBs right now? There's instant Bloomberg's. I think they might be. They might be. They're listening and they're saying. Bailey we agree with you. Big, big. That's what that noise is. We do it in real time. We do. We do. We do. Bailey here's what I don't quite get and maybe you can explain it to me because you look at this stuff so closely. Let's say you are a regulated crypto exchange such as coin base and one of your biggest competitors just got taken out and now people need a new place to go to buy and sell crypto because they want to use something that is regulated and publicly traded and has audited financial statements. When FTX's loss be coin bases gained? Yeah, and I think that's kind of where the short thesis plays out though. Yes, people wouldn't theory be rotating over to a platform like coin base because obviously as you mentioned it should be better regulated and should have more stability. But when you're looking at this the entire crypto space is kind of a long game. So if you're short and coin base or you're investing in coin base right now you have to be thinking is this going to be viable not only in the next few months but is this something that we're going to actually see tremendous growth in the next five, 10, 15 years and that's really where the question is. The backdrop to this is that okay if something like this happened to FTX which was seen as the face of the crypto industry then you know some people could be throwing in the towel and saying I'm just done. Exactly. We've been learning every day and every hour it seems how kind of overlapping this is and how actually it is a very tight ecosystem even though it has long been pitched decentralized right. Exactly. What's interesting like what you said you know for every seller there's a buyer and we know Kathy Wood who is certainly in on all things disruptive and innovative and she does change her tune a little bit on something sometimes but she really sticks to her guns when it comes to what she's betting on. It's been what buying Coinbase Silvergate Capital, Gracecale Bitcoin Trust she is looking at these dips as some opportunities. And that's been the whole argument of ARC is that they're investing with a five year horizon and one of the things we've been tracking has actually been retail traders also buying. So as you mentioned they are buying. They are buying not mass not the buying that we'd seen you know back when the initial bubble was really kind of running up in late 2020 early 2021 but they are seeing retail data at least that we've been tracking retail traders are buying this dip kind of with that diamond hands hope that eventually things will go back. You know Bailey one of the conversations that Tim and I keep kind of having with this FTX fallout over the last couple of weeks is you know we've all been trying to track what kind of further market contagion and it really just feel like there's contagion within the crypto space but even that is a little bit limited but that's where you're really seeing the pain. But I mean ultimately as you follow this sector against the backdrop of the broader market it's like what are you going to be watching?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,310,2022-11-17 20:24:33
17697," But even that is a little bit limited, but that's where you're really seeing the pain. But I mean, ultimately as you follow this sector, I get the backdrop of the broader market. It's like, what are you going to be watching over the next? I don't know whether it's month, two months, three months to kind of figure out where this settles in and what it means in terms of the overall investment space and as an asset class? I think it's just tracking the contagion. Obviously you saw, again, the fallout of FTX was so swift that they were in a great financial position that they were going to get bought by Binance and then they're all of a sudden was an 8 billion dollar liability whole black hole on their balance sheet. So when you're looking at it, the entire argument of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in this entire space is that it's the future of finance and you should really just trust us even if you don't. You shouldn't, your distrust of traditional banks plays into this. Well, that's one of the things that's been falling out and that's been the kind of the argument of this crypto winter. Is it a crypto ice age and is it a crypto extinction? Well, that's what I'm wondering and you know, I've been texting. I do. I keep asking if it's over and I think Katie Greifeld last week asked the question in a Twitter poll and I think it was 50-50. I could be speaking out of turn though because she does a lot of polls. What are the analysts telling you who you speak to? Like, how has their tune changed around crypto and crypto related stocks? One of the things that's been the most interesting to me is that a lot of crypto bulls have kind of bought into the idea that maybe you should only be allocating 5% of your portfolio to Bitcoin as opposed to kind of the laser eyes people who are like invest only a Bitcoin. That's so weird. We didn't hear this a year ago when Bitcoin was at close to $69,000. Much like covering SPACs, everything kind of. Except is Tom Brady running to the bankruptcy court? He's actually named in the lawsuit and in case you didn't notice his Twitter profile no longer has laser eyes and he's now a statue. So we're seeing a lot of the people who are more than happy to make a lot of money pitching these exchanges and these tokens changing their tunes at least quietly. The bots have been pretty quiet on Twitter for me too when I tweet about crypto lately. Yeah, same here. That's kind of welcome. 5% not all in. Like don't put the retirement funds. It seems belly-lipshelts. Thank you so much. So glad we could get to this story.

How did you do that so quickly? Yeah, it's the magic of radio. What can I tell you? Connection right to the mind. Charlie, got to shake you off right now. All right, let's get to Alex Barinca, technology reporter up Bloomberg News, because she's got a great story, the new double issue of Bloomberg Business Week dealing with meta platforms. Alex is with us via Zoom in LA. So Alex, good to have you here. Tell us about your story. Yeah, so we've heard a lot of anger at the general economic conditions from all of the internet companies like meta that depend on digital ads, blaming the economy for the really bad quarters they've had over the last six months or so. This week in Business Week, I'm writing that there might be kind of a bigger reason that meta in particular is ad business. It has a big hole in it. And that poll is shaped like Apple. About a year ago, Apple changed its privacy policies for the iPhone that made ads on social media both harder to target specific people and harder to track the return on the spend on those ads. And a year in meta has estimated that that had a $10 billion hit on it's ad business. And myself and a lot of the analysts and insiders I spoke for this story, would also argue that that's what's dragging meta down to potentially if it's third, quite straight quarter of revenue declines. It's more Apple than the economy. And I tried to break that down for folks this week. Well, there's a stark chart included in your piece that shows how other companies are faring or projected to fare between 2021 and 2022. TikTok, according to EMarketer, has a projected change of 155% versus meta down at the bottom of a projected change of negative 2%. Why is TikTok able to capitalize on something when they're using the same hardware and the same operating systems to deliver those ads? I think there's two key reasons. So meta, as you mentioned, Facebook, Instagram, those are meta's companies have historically been based on who you know. Your friend graph is how they derive insights on you. And plus the information that they were able to bleed from Apple to make sure that advertisers are reaching the people they want to reach. TikTok, on the other hand, has built out an AI kind of focused recommendation engine that is derived on a user's interest. So they know more about you than just who you know. They know who you're actually interested in. That is some of the information. It's not quite Apple's to Apple's that meta has lost. So TikTok has been able to kind of really lean into this interest-based recommendations. And that idea, interest-based recommendations, is also where meta is spending a lot of money to kind of chase into that. Now, the one caveat I would give is meta is still an advertising giant. They're still expected to brand about 160.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,313,2022-11-17 20:37:33
17700," is also where meta is spending a lot of money to kind of chase into that. Now, the one caveat I would give is meta is still an advertising giant. They're still expected to bring in about $116 billion in revenue this year. TikTok is only about a tenth of that. So there is some kind of youth in growth there for TikTok. But that is kind of the big reason that folks might be looking to platforms where they can target people a little bit more effectively than maybe what's been lost on Facebook and Instagram. I got to say Alex, one of the lines I love in your story, you say the company has no experience managing decline. There's something to be said. I mean, this is a company that has been on fire, maybe a little bit of a, you know, trouble at that IPO initially, but figured it out right in the ship. But when things start to go wrong, like you might not have a playbook or the people in place to be like, well, wait, how do we fix this? Right. And you remember just last week, they laid off 13% of the workforce and their biggest layoff ever. So this is a company now that's going to be expected to do more with less. So this Apple thing is a big problem, but there are a lot of other problems at meta. You have the economic conditions. You have this scrutiny on the political power that Facebook and Instagram have on the world. You have this big bet that Mark Zuckerberg is making trying to build a virtual reality world called the Metaverse and funneling $10 billion a year into that direction. So there's a lot going on there. And now it's going on with 11,000 people fewer than just two weeks ago. So it seems like they're really going to have to kind of buckle down. We've heard internally that there's still some restructuring going on that this is the first time that a lot of employees are being pushed to a level of efficiency and lean this than they ever have before. So this will definitely be one to watch. Is they kind of juggle both coming back from these changes that Apple forced upon their business, battling economic conditions and trying to paint the future of computing in the Metaverse. Hey, Alex, I kind of want to throw a little bit of a curveball at you because it's not necessarily what your most recent piece is about. But I know you've done so much reporting about this. I'm wondering what small businesses think of this change because they're the ones who have done a lot of advertising historically on Meta platforms, including Facebook and Instagram. And now ostensibly, it's more difficult for them to target their potential customers. Yep, there are those curveballs away. I will say, they've been, this has been okay. They've spent more on newspapers or buying ads on TV channels. So the big companies can do that because they have the budgets. Small businesses have kind of historically been stuck with two options with basically Meta or Google Alphabet's search ads when it comes to reaching customers on the internet. So they've been the folks who basically have had to kind of go roll with the punches here. And that's also why we think there's been such a big decline in overall ad spending. Those are the folks that kind of have to pull back because they can't write, say, a half a million dollar check to advertise on something like Hulu. They're kind of stuck reaching customers on the internet and it's gotten a lot more expensive because the targeting is less effective. So those folks are the ones that are probably impacting at the biggest from a peer quantity perspective. That's the majority of Meta's advertisers. So small businesses also are probably looking to places like TikTok and other properties where they can spend the small budgets they have to find the customers that they want. Alex Barinka really appreciate it. Tech reporter here at Bluberg News. Let's get to Denise Pellegrini standing by with World of National News. Hey Denise. Hey there. Well, President Biden's top economic advisor, Brian Deese, who's been on Bloomberg Radio multiple times. Well, he is expected to leave the White House next year according to sources. Though the sources do also say the president would like Deese to stay and there's no timeline for his departure. Also, Cecilia Raus, chair of the Council of Economic Advisors. She's also said to be leaving next year. She'll return to Princeton. Moving on here, Nancy Pelosi announcing she is stepping down more comings and goings as Speaker of the House. Thank you all. May God bless you and your families. And may God bless, continue to bless our veterans and the United States of America. It really was a long goodbye there on Capitol Hill. A plaz was very, very long then. She went on to thank just about everyone in the room personally. She will continue to serve as Congressperson for her district in San Francisco.

17701," Now that Republicans have captured a majority in the House, the House GOP expected to put more pressure on the White House to take a more hawkish stance with China, Bloomberg say we have more in that. Republican lawmakers are likely to portray President Biden's attempt to ease tensions with China as a sign of weakness. They say they'll probe White House policy toward Asia and confront Beijing more forcefully. House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy wants to form a special congressional committee to go after China on everything from trade and national security to the origins of COVID-19. He also plans to lead a congressional trip to Taiwan, something House Speaker Nancy Pelosi did earlier this year. In Washington, I'm Amy Morris, Bloomberg Radio.

Can we talk about mortgage rates? Yeah. Kind of been following these numbers. Yeah, I have to. I think a lot of people have. It says a lot about where, you know, kind of explains why the housing market has slowed down a lot. Yeah. A lot of the headlines that we've been focused on over the last few months have been about mortgage rates make the biggest jump higher, right? Right. So, in the 1980s, today we actually saw one that went the other way, which I think is finally a little bit of good news. US mortgage rates, posting the biggest drops since 1981, falling to 6.61%. We're talking about the average rate for a 30 year fixed mortgage, 6.61% the lowest level in almost two months. Freddie Mac putting this out in a statement today last week, the average was 7.08%. That's a pretty big drawdown. That is. I mean, look, it's the biggest drops since 1981. It's meaningful. Yeah. You were to go back about a year and time and say, you know, wait a second, this is still twice what a 30 year fixed ended up costing, you know, in the latter half of 2021. Then you'd be right. And a lot of people locked in those lower rates. They locked in it, you know, sub four percent. A lot of people locking in it sub three percent. Those are those annoying friends and family that are never going to move. That's what I'm going to say. No, right. And you're like, guess what? I locked it in. I was like, ahead of the curve. Well, you know what Gina Martin Adams says about them. She says they're going to be stuck there and not going to be able to move. And their home values will actually end up falling as a result of higher mortgage rates. You told us that a few weeks ago. She did say that. Perspective, right? In terms of it's because you will anticipate that the housing market as it continues to or will soften that those prices that have been kind of on fire will go down. We haven't seen them come down as much as many people. It takes a while for it to work through the system. Correct. Exactly. So kind of interesting. Work rates, though, have doubled this year, have depressed demand for homes, causing builders to pull back on construction and pushing sellers to cut back on their asking prices. The latest decline in rates offers a reprieve. The recent volatility in bargain costs is, quote, causing a large degree of uncertainty for both house hunters and owners considering listing their properties. That's from Georgia Tau, manager of economic research at Realtor.com. Kind of hard to lock this stuff in sometimes, too. It's complicated as everything is. It feels like in our world.

This editorial was written by the Bloomberg editorial board.

17703," East for the UK, where a surge in migrants arriving by boat is overwhelming the country's asylum system. In response, the government of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has revived plans to deport some asylum seekers to Rwanda, where they'd be allowed to settle if their claims are approved. But Britain's partnership with Rwanda, which has a less than spotless human rights record, carries significant risks. It would be better to focus on fixing the existing immigration system, for example, by investing in staff and technology to speed up asylum claims. The UK has shown itself capable of leadership on some migration issues in recent years. Pushing ahead with this ill-considered scheme would tarnish its hard-earned reputation.

If necessary, physical or mental health, do as in 75. It's the questions that drives us. Next is The Drive to the Gulf. on Bloomberg Radio. All right, we have just about 10 minutes left in today's trading session bouncing around here on the equity trade same story when it comes to the yield trade I think as investors go from Fed conversation to Fed conversation right now in terms of stocks specifically. As Charlie mentioned, definitely off our lows of the session and we're seeing a leg up Tim here in our final minutes of trading. We are, but volume is really low right now. The S&P down volume down 20%. I think people already started to think about that Thanksgiving holiday. That's what I want to ask Charlie Massimo all about. He's seen a rice president and financial advisor at the wealth enhancement group on the phone from Blue Point in New York. Charlie, good to have you back with us. How are you? Great. Thanks for having me as always. Yeah. Hey, so what are investors waiting for? Why are they on the sidelines? Yeah. I think the Fed's confusing the heck out of everybody would comment and there's a lack of conviction. Yeah, yeah. I think there's just a lack of conviction on which way we want to go. And I think people are just waiting for the next data point to make a decision on where they want to put their money. Well, where would you want to put your money right now if you had to put some new money to work? I think there are so many positive things happening in the market right now despite what we read in the headlines. And you have inflation which is coming down without seeing any deterioration in the labor market which is a really positive indication in something the Fed is certainly going to pay attention to. I think you have S&P 500 companies with their so flush with cash which means that we probably will see increase in dividends coming along. So I'm a huge proponent of value stocks that are going to show increased dividends and really going to pay people to wait while we see a real turnaround in the market. Can you name any specific value stocks that you have your eye on right now? Yeah, again, I think when you see any stocks like Target that are beat up these are great companies right? And when you can buy a company 20 to 30% cheaper than where they were just a year ago you have to take advantage of it. Because again I think in the year two years from today these companies are going to be significantly higher. And again I've always said this. This is not when you become shy of investing in the market. This is when you become very aggressive and buy some of these great American companies. So it raises the question about whether or not you think we have further losses ahead of us. Like is there going to be a better time to get into the market maybe in the first half of 2023? Well listen, you can always debate when is the right time and I think as an individual investor you have to see where you are in your own time frame. But again, when these companies we spoke probably about two months ago when the market was about 10% lower than where it is today. So again, was that a good time to invest? Did we hit bottom? I think when you look at the market it's much more positive and much more constructive now. Meaning the lows are much better than what we've seen a year ago and a week ago or two weeks ago. And the highs are pretty significant on updates. So I think we're starting to see.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,317,2022-11-17 20:54:55
17704, those are are much better than what we've seen a year ago in the hot a week ago or two weeks ago and the highs are pretty significant on update so i think we're starting to see a market that is trying to find direction but the direction is much more positive the negative right now uh... yeah it is kind of uh... it's so funny i was just looking at the home builders the home building index which is certainly a laggard in today's market it's down about two percent if you look at the s and p's to be a composite home building index but you know it's been bouncing around a lot and i understand the housing data it feels like it's a little bit more to the downside but the group is still up fifteen percent since october twenty-eighth i always feel like there's mixed signals in this market so charlie what do you most monitor forgetting an idea of maybe where valuations should be in where the market will ultimately go because it does sound like you have some optimism for the trade in twenty twenty three and that not only twenty twenty three and and certainly beyond i mean when you think about some of the staggering numbers you know i was just reading today that the bookings institution projects up between twenty twenty twenty thirty about one point six billion people well into the middle class i mean that's that's significant so you think it's a into the middle class in these great companies that will continue to prosper from this growth in our in our economy in our world so it's really not one specific place that i'm looking i'm just looking at the general as a market as a whole that as as we continue to see these numbers improved is just a uh... or an amazing opportunity for the companies across the board really to see increased values at a significant clip okay so charlie i want to go back to fed speakers because we talk about a lot here of course and we try to dissect all of their comments and i'm wondering if you take everyone who you've heard from over the last a few days or so uh... the message that you're seeing is a one that's broadly showing that we're going to see an easing of rate hike come to samber and the early part of twenty twenty three or is it one that says there's still more work to do well i think over the short term there's probably still more work to do and and that's not because of uh... inflation uh... not slowing or slowing down because we are but i think it's really the fed that's trying to be overly aggressive in this market you know what he's done already and i agree with what he's been doing because again a short term bear market is much worse than long term inflation for this economy so i agree with what he's doing but i think now it's time to let all these raises seep into the market and slow down to what i'd love to see him say is that we may have more work to go but we're going to slow down the pace and we're going to wait to see that make that that our increases in in yields are really helping the inflation slow down that's what i'm hoping he says i don't know if you'll save that but i think that would be huge positive indication for the market you know charlie we've talked about this before with you because you and what you do at your firm you specialize in planning for families impacted by autism and you know these are families that really have to make sure that they've got investments in place so i do think in an environment where we feel like things keep coming at us left and right longer term you know what do you see as the best bets yet again it's a really great point and and and i think that you have to take a deep breath as an investor and really measure where you are from a risk tolerance standpoint you know in in the past years is great to own technology but now you have some of those companies down thirty to seventy percent you've lost three to five years of growth in one year or in less than one does that ever come back it will but it's going to lack the rest of the market like it can look like the dot com bust of the late nineties early two thousand and take a decade i mean not not i don't think it's back to some of these companies have real earnings versus and dot com where they had no earnings at all so i think we have companies like amazon that are having a difficult time that will still show some significant earnings moving forward but i do think again you get getting back to point of carl you have to be you have to look at the market and say hey where am i going to get the steadiest growth not get the big ups and downs and i think the steady growth is being brought based not overweating in any industry and the sector and and again i know value is out of favor but again over time value will be more the can the more consistent alright well charlie thank you so much have a good uh... thanksgiving charlie mouse and most senior vp financial advisor wealth enhancement group on the phone from blue point new york i'm dead over two or t-v co,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,318,2022-11-17 20:59:17
17705," All right, well Charlie, thank you so much. Have a good Thanksgiving. Charlie Malsamo, senior VP, financial advisor at Wealth enhancement group on the phone from Blue Point, New York. All right, time to head over to our TV colleagues for our cross-platform coverage. We're going to count you down to the closing bell on this Thursday. We're going to do it on Radio TV, YouTube and on Bloomberg Quicktake. Beyond the bell, Bloomberg's comprehensive cross-platform coverage of the US market closed, starts right now. And right now, we are two minutes away from the end of the trading day. Romain Bostic alongside Scarlett Foo, we're counting you down to the closing bell. And here to help take us beyond the bell. Let's our global simulcast with Carol Master, who's leaning to the side and Tim Stenevich, who's still straight up. We welcome our audiences across Bloomberg Television, Radio as well as on YouTube and Quicktake Departus, the most crucial moments of the day. Carol, what was most crucial to you? Well, I don't know. I feel like there's no direction. I mean, I feel like we're bouncing all around the place. And what's interesting is I was looking at that home builders in particular today. They're down almost 2% in today's session, although they bounced off in a big way since mid-October. We got some housing starts data that was lower, so some concerns about that. But I just feel like, you know, you dig deeper, Romain, and you constantly see contradictions of maybe the supply is still tight. So the fundamentals are out there for this market to still do well, but then if you get a recession, it won't do so well. So I just felt like there's a lot of contradictory signals. That's kind of exactly what Charlie Massimo, the senior vice president financial advisor, Welfen Hansman Group, just told us on our program. He said, he thinks the Fed is confusing the heck out of everyone. That's his quote. He says, I think there's a lack of conviction on where we want to go. And I asked him why, you know, volume is so low. I mean, we're down 20% right now on the S&P 500. And he said everybody's just waiting for kind of that next economic data point because we are getting mixed messages. Well, I think you talked about how all these mixed signals. We heard from Yelkesh, Carl, a little bit earlier, that you talked about. Because I think his exact quote was that the U.S. economy is sending wildly mixed signals. And when you look at housing starts, when you look at the Philadelphia Fed outlook that we got as well as initial jobless claims, that will definitely mix when you add them all together. In other words, time. We all need time to see how the data shakes out because you can't draw any conclusions from one month of encouraging CPT. I think that's why we're encouraging CPI data because look at what happened back in July. There was a head fake when it came to inflation. Absolutely here. And now you have Marcus trying to sort it all out as we get the closing bells here on this Thursday afternoon. The Dow Jones industrial average that has been a good portion of the day in the red. We're waiting for these numbers to settle. But basically it's going to be unchanged on the day. Right now, the numbers say it's down about six points. So that's basically less than a tenth of a percent. But again, we're going to wait for these numbers to settle. The S&P 500 definitely going to finish lower. But by only three tenths of a percent, similar story for the NASDAQ composite down about three tenths of a percent. And the Russell 2000, which was down more than a percent on the day, trying to claw back but still going to finish lower Carol by about eight tenths of a percent. Yeah, the S&P 500 digging deeper. Most names in the index were lower today. So 33 to be exact 168 higher to unchanged. But I what I will point out scarlet is reaction did see some buying into the clothes, which I thought was pretty interesting. Here we are on this Thursday when we saw so much bouncing around that there were actually where some buyers coming in. Yeah, absolutely. I look at the 24 industry groups in the S&P 500 at one point. There were only three groups that were higher. But now you have seven groups that are higher. All along, we've seen the tech hardware space doing well because of Cisco coming out with a better forecast than expected for this quarter. And telecoms getting a lift thanks to T mobile. But utilities have been in the red all day. They continue to finish in the red down 1.8%. All right. Let's get to some of those gainers. Scarlet mentioned it. We've been talking about it. Cisco top in the NASDAQ 100 and the S&P 500 earnings last night. Big as maker of machines. You know that run computer networks and the internet. So they are, you know, feeling pretty upbeat in terms of their results. They gave a bullish revenue forecast helped by corporate and government spending on tech said demanded not fall off a cliff. So this stock was up almost 5% today's session. Beth and body works top in the S&P 500 up 20 almost 25% in today's session boosting its full year profit forecast due to a focus on innovation and cost control. All of us found the results to be impressive overall and investors certainly piled into this one in a big way. And do want to mention I know I talked about those Chinese ADRs earlier while Alibaba one of the standouts on top of the NASDAQ 100 up about 8% soaring amid profit beats and also talked about stock buyback so.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,319,2022-11-17 21:03:35
17706," Well, Ellie Bava, one of the standouts on top of the Nasdaq 100 up about 8% soaring amid profit beats and also talked about stock buybacks. So we're talking about $15 billion, maybe announcing plans to upsize it to buy about $15 billion. So investors, you guys rushing into this one. All right, you got the gainers, Carol. I got the decliner. So we look at the bottom of the S&P 500 in terms of weights on it. Today, Tesla and Amazon were the biggest. Let's start with Tesla. Shares finished the day down by 2%. Shares moved lower after we saw Democratic senators led by Richard Blumenthal and Elizabeth Warren call on the FTC to conduct an oversight and enforcement of Twitter's consent degree. Of course, Tesla CEO Elon Musk's Twitter deal has been a drag on the company's stock. And then keeping on shares of Amazon as well, down 2.3%. This was one of my decliner's yesterday, down another 2% today after the company began its largest round of layoffs in its history this week. Down 20% just since October and nearly 50% since its highs of last July. And then Nvidia Shares starting out higher today, but finishing down by 1.5%. The company did report third quarter revenue that was better than expected, though the company's outlook did miss some estimates. Analyst still broadly positive on the company, but a declining day for Nvidia. Let's take a quick look at the yield space, because of course a lot of those comments that we got out of the bullard as well as some of the other Fed members really drove that sell off in treasuries today. At one point on the day, we were down more than 10 basis points pretty much across the board. Most of the activity, though, was in the shorter end of that curve. A two-year yield right around 4445.7. That's up about nine basis points here on the day. The 10 year still firmly under 4%. But that also didn't move higher. And we did see a deeper inversion on that 2.10s curve down below negative 70 at one point here on the day. I do want to go back to some earnings here. And Carol, you left out one key mover today, and that was, of course, Macy's. Interesting moves in some of the retailers. Now we're getting earnings out of raw stores here. They look pretty good. Comp sales were actually down, but 3%. That sounds bad. But the street was looking forward to a decline of 8%. So basically not as bad as expected. 3Q operating margins were better than expected at 9.8% versus a street estimate of 8.8%. And here's your guidance here for the fourth quarter. They're looking for EPS of $1.13 to $1.26. The street on average was looking for $1.16. And the company now saying the 4Q comp sales will be flat to down 2%. All right. So let's get to also another one reporting. The street was looking for $1.68 fourth quarter net sales. 6.75 billion also outperformance there. The estimate on the street was 6.38 billion dollars. And as for the outlook, first quarter net sales, about 6.3 to 7.1 billion, way outperformance because the street estimate right now is 6.34 billion. Stock is up about 2%. But you know, you guys, the SOX, the semiconductor area, we've had a lot of bad news and we've seen a lot of pressure on this sector. And that explains why there's some upbeat reaction here in the after hours when it comes to investors pushing A-MAT up about 2.4%. Because these are some better than expected numbers. Yeah. And building on the gains that we saw in trading today, SMH, the ETF that tracks, semiconductor SOX closing up 8 tens of 1%. For now, it looks like we might see those gains continue. Remain, I just want to go back to Roth's for a moment because I guess it's not that surprising to see it do well. I mean, Roth's is perfectly positioned for this kind of economy where it, the consumers might be trading down or looking for a deal. Yeah. Well, that's why I brought up Macy's because I mean, when we looked at their earnings and how well they did today, they'll share something like 14%. It was the idea that folks were sort of buying into their higher end brand. So the Bloomingdale's and BloomerCory, not necessarily in Macy's itself. When we were speaking with John Edwards, a Bloomingberg editor here, who basically talked about that's really the dichotomy now that we're going to see when it comes to consumer spending. The really high end folks are going to do well. And some of the folks at the lower end of the spectrum are going to do well. And maybe Roth's stores, I guess you would fit into that lower end. If you're going to spend money and want to spend it on a big brand, a brand that's worthy of your dollars, and if not, you want to get a great deal. If you're shopping for me, definitely Bloomingdale's over at Roth's. What about chips? Is there an okay segue to do to go back to A-Matt? Because I want to talk about some of the comments about the economy that we're seeing in the press release here. Gary Dickerson, the presidency of the company, this is what sticks out to me. He says, quote, though we are seeing a slowing the rate of spending growth in the near-term amid geopolitical and macroeconomic challenges, we are making the strategic investments to win the major technology inflections that will enable applied to grow outgrow the semiconductor markets. So they can say they can overperform the market by making these strategic investments. Yeah, it's in the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,320,2022-11-17 21:08:04
17707," the strategic investments to win the major technology inflections that will enable applied to grow outgrow the semiconductor markets. We're going to say they can say they can overperform the market by making these strategic investments. Yeah, it's something we talk about all the time right. These geopolitical and macro-economic challenges. So talking about it in the near term, some concerns about that. Though Amat's still up about 2.2% here in the after hours, where should we go, guys? I don't know, Carol. I mean, aren't you the ringleader? We should go to Ross. What happens? I keep thinking about bad bath and not bad bath and body works. Just outperformance today. Like somebody's retail name is a good idea. Because of my frosted coconut snowball hand soap. Is this seasonal? It's the red bakery. Is it seasonal? It's the fenty bath balls that I know Romantian is buying, right? No. Well, first of all, I should just point out our house is full of candles for some reason. Not because of me. Is that seasonal? Yeah, I mean, I won't say why, but anyway, it's not any coconut fluff balls. It's not a coconut snowball. It's snowball, whatever it's like. It was like regular flavors or whatever you called them. So, to have these. Regular flavors like vanilla icicles. Yeah. And all seriousness though, I mean, we talk about sort of the trajectory of consumer spending, particularly during a holiday season that traditionally has always been the meat of how these companies make their money, right? This is sort of when these, it's black Friday because that's when these companies typically would go into the black in terms of profitability. Is that going to be the case? Well, and this is I think going to be very key during this holiday season. Can consumers continue to spend through it? How are they spending? Are they, you know, kind of adding on to charge cards which could be problematic if we start to see some kind of recession or drop slowdown in the new year? So, it is going to be very important. And just real quickly, the squeeze is in. Farfetch shares down about 15% of the after-hour trading. And, you know, a lot of what they sell is definitely more of those designers, those high-end brands here. So, I'm curious to see as to why they're sort of missing on some of their revenue targets. While, say, a blooming delts does well, a raw stores at the lower end does well, where does it's like a farfetch of those types of companies? Well, we'll go back to Neil Cush-Cari, right? There's mixed signals, like within the market, or, you know, I don't know, it's kind of hard to make sense. Then it comes down to your management and inventory selection and making sure you can manage that correctly. Hello, Target, right? Yeah, sure. You're all getting candles for Christmas, but... Thank you. We're going to do a shopping tour and we're going to survive at bed. No, I keep saying bedbath and beyond. They're all so similar. Yeah. You remember when they had that Kentucky fried chicken candle that sold out in New Zealand? We got to go. We're going to get a nail that really soon. All right, guys, that's a wrap. Our cross-platform coverage. Radio TV, YouTube, Bloomberg QuickTech. We do it all, counting it down to the close on this Thursday. We'll see you again, same time, same place, tomorrow. This is Bloomberg Business Week with Carol Maser and Bloomberg QuickTakes Tim Stenevick on Bloomberg Radio. It's Bloomberg Business Week, Tim Stenevick and Carol Maser, reliving the Bloomberg Interactive at Broker's Studio. Let's get to world in national news. For that, we turn to Denise Pellegrini. She's standing by. She's in Bloomberg World Headquarters in the newsroom. Hey, Denise. Thank you, Tim. And as we've been reporting, Nancy Pelosi is stepping down as Speaker of the House. For me, the hours come for a new generation to lead the Democratic caucus that I so deeply respect. And I'm grateful that so many are ready and willing to shoulder this awesome responsibility. And Pelosi says she will continue to serve the people of San Francisco. Senator Michael Bennett, Democrat from Colorado, meantime, saying in response, watch for Democrats in the Lamedok session to push for the defense reauthorization to help Ukraine, plus extend child tax credits and also pass a Farm Modernization Act. Those are just a few things that I think we could address in this Lamedok session and go out in a really positive way. And Bennett also telling us on balance of power, the Senate will pass a respect for Marijack by later this week. The incoming GOP majority in the House likely to mean Congress will drop its bid for former President Trump's tax return, Splimberg's Nathan Haker has more than that. Democrats running the House Ways and Means Committee have been in a legal battle since 2019 for the IRS to hand over the former President's tax records. Now three Republicans, Vern Buchanan, Adrian Smith and Jason Smith are competing to take over as committee chair. All three tell CNBC they would drop the tax return effort. The current ranking Republican on House Ways and Means is retiring Congressman Kevin Brady, he has not endorsed either of the three candidates to succeed him. In Washington, I'm Nathan Haker, Bloomberg Radio. All right, thank you Nathan and ticket master is now blaming bot attacks and uninvited fans for the unprecedented site trap.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,321,2022-11-17 21:12:27
17708," In Washington, I'm Nathan Hager, Bloomberg Radio. All right, thank you, Nathan. And ticket master is now blaming bot attacks and uninvited fans for the unprecedented site traffic and outages at long wait times during Tuesday's Taylor Swift concert pre-sale. You know, a record of more than two million tickets were sold that day. Global news 24 hours a day. I'm Denise Pelligrini, but this is Bloomberg. Add this to the list of crises this year. I should have done live nation as one of my decliners. It felt today after Taylor Swift ticket sales were halted. Yeah, Denise is talking about this ticket master. I know. Cancelling Friday's general public sales siding in insufficient remaining ticket inventory. Are these on the holiday list for your family? No, but you know what? My daughter was supposed to go to a Taylor Swift concert and then because of COVID, it just never happened. We scheduled it for like a year and then it then she just can't. So we kind of say you can kind of go see her maybe anywhere in the world, but I don't know that we really mean that. That was before ticket prices were so expensive. That was before, you know what? That was when inflation was at 2% Carol. That's what you're excused. Times have changed. Well, what's interesting, ticket master sold over two million tickets to Swift's 52 date stadium tour. A record for most ticket sales for one artist in a day. Overwhelming demand on Tuesday's verified fan pre-sale led the site to crash. Sparking widespread fan adage. I'm just reading a story that's here. Might be I'm not sure who it's from. A year or another, but but anyway, it's all out there and I will say if you ever try to get tickets to somebody who's really popular, it's really frustrating that it's very difficult. I just sent you the one Carol that came out minutes ago from our own Allegra, Fredkin and Martin Paris. Thank you. Ticketmaster said that bot attacks and uninvited fans drove, quote, unpressing in a traffic that caused website outages in long wait times. The site was criticized for excessive wait times during the sale and Tennessee's AG is now investigating those complaints. The company said on Thursday that only about 15% of interactions across the site experience issues. What I would love to see, Carol, is just some sort of commentary around how if you have so much experience in the space like a company like Live Nation ticket master, how you're still susceptible to bot attacks like this. I don't know. It really makes it very difficult for kind of the average fan, I consider, you know, us right, us average fans to get access to tickets. And so something needs to be done. And if you know anything about Taylor Swift, she really cares about her fan base. And when she feels like the system is taking over, she doesn't like it. So stay tuned.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,322,2022-11-17 21:16:47

17710," us to outperform in any environment. All right. The bulk of earnings is over, but we're still getting to a few of them. And among them was Sonos. We talked about them. Stock was up about 3% up as much as 6% at its highs today, settling though on this Thursday with a 3% gain. They reported earnings last night after the close. Among the headlines that stood out, fourth could a revenue beat estimates and analysts finding the print to be solid. So let's see what our next guest has to say. He's president and CEO of Sonos. Patrick Spence is back with us. And so delighted to have you in our interactive broker studio. Welcome. Thank you. It's great to be back. Yes. How are you? Talk to us about the business and how things are going. We've seen things stabilized. So we obviously took a hit back in June in terms of the trajectory in our business. And so since then, post pandemic or continuation of a post pandemic reset or what is it? I think it was more macroeconomic in terms of just generally like what consumers were doing and in the summer traveling and all of those things. And so we did a bit of a reset at that point. And what we've seen in this quarter is we got it right, our business stabilized. And we shared a few data points on the call around registrations, which are kind of like the underlying activations of new Sonos speakers that show, in fact, it's kind of we're pretty optimistic in terms of where we are right now and what we're seeing. And so it's stable. And that's kind of the way we've set our guidance as we go forward. We're not expecting things to get much worse. We're not expecting it to get much better. So we're just trying to be prudent in this kind of environment. A lot of competition in the space, you guys are still relatively small. Because you point out when you join us every few months, I'm wondering about who your customer is. And I think about this in the context of what we saw from Walmart. What's the other thing? What's the other thing? Well, that's the thing. The focus is on you. Yeah, that's true. But I'm wondering, as you try to grow, we see a company like Walmart report results. And they say that upper middle class customers are now trading down and shopping at Walmart rather than target. We saw that play out this week. Who's your customer and are you worried about people trading down to less expensive competitors? We're not. And I'm watching during a period like this, you want to watch MarketChair very closely. And from what we're seeing, we're gaining share in this period. And I think that speaks to the brand. But we do talk about the more affluent homes that we're in. And again, you pointed it out, we're so small in the grand scheme of things. We're in 9% of the homes that we think we can be in ultimately. So we have a lot of room to go. We don't get overly promotional. We kind of approach this in a very sustainable, kind of steady way. And so we feel like there's lots of opportunity ahead. There'll be obviously ups and downs because of the economy. But overall, we feel like our customer is stable right now from what we can see. And so we'll be watching it closely. If things change, we'll definitely make adjustments in our business. But right now, it appears our customers are pretty stable. So you're not talking recession or thinking recession internally in terms of meetings and saying, hey, guys, we're going to have to be thinking about this. We're watching it very carefully. Obviously not an economist. So I don't know whether recession or not. But it has slowed down. It slowed down. We kind of took that change in June. Right. But since then, it's been stable. So we haven't seen it get worse. I haven't seen it get better. I do expect at some point it'll get better. But I don't know if that's 12 months, 18 months from now as well. Patrick, who's your best customer? Is it existing customers like Tim and myself and others who already have some equipment? Or is it the new guy? So we added 1.4 million new ones in the last 12 months. We're up to over 14 million homes now. And it's remarkably steady in the sense that 40% to 45% of our sales every year come for our existing customers adding more. And then the rest of it comes from new customers. And the number one way that new customers coming to the system is existing customers telling their friends and family. So it's a pretty powerful model in that way. And we've got a good balance between existing and new. Guilty, I sit as all the time, but I'm guilty of buying gifts. Sonos gifts for my sister and my dad who are big customers. Hey, Patrick, you're not an economist. You said, but you've got to make decisions based on what you think the economy is going to look like. What's headcount looking like in 2023? Are you had to pull back and lay anyone off? Are you planning to lay anyone off? So we focused on sustainable profitable growth before it was fashionable. So we've been profitable for four years. We didn't get to what I say crazy in terms of hiring through these periods. We've been investing in a very disciplined way. So I'd say we're kind of zigging well. There's a tag. We're still hiring people. I mentioned on our earnings call last night that we're looking at expanding into four new categories. And so we've been hiring people that help us actually do some things and bring some skills we don't have.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,324,2022-11-17 21:25:30
17711," We've been hiring people that help us actually do some things and bring some skills we don't have yet today. So I feel like this is one of those times where there's opportunity for us to emerge from this period even stronger. And that's why we've focused on being profitable and being able to be in control of our own destiny. You know, I want to talk about innovation, but we'll say that for the next block. What does worry you though? You've been doing this for a long time with your business. I mean, at this point, it's multiple years. You've seen different cycles. 30 seconds. So what does worry you our own ability to execute and deliver on the new products? What is that means? You see us in presence. Save us all the time. Well, it's much more about what you can control and what you can do. So making sure we bring out, I know what you mean, but it really is about our ability to get the new products out. You know, be able to do the things that we need to do because we can't control the economy. We can't control the consumer. All we can do is make sure that we're showing up in the best way possible and adjust accordingly. Is there better control over those factors? Right now, Patrick in terms of supply chains and stuff. Oh, definitely on supply chain. It's gotten much better than it was. Last year, this time, we were talking about the inability to get any product and people waiting months. So yeah, it's gotten much better. All right, sit tight. Just having some fun with you. We're going to come back with Patrick's Ben, CEO of Sona. He's here in our interactive broker studio. I do want to talk about innovation and what's in the pipeline. It's coming up next on Bluebird.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,325,2022-11-17 21:30:07

Bloomberg 960 to the country. Syria's XM channel 119 and around the globe. The Bloomberg Business app and Bloomberg Radio.com. This is Bloomberg Business Week. Are you listening and watching Bloomberg Business Week? We're going to get back to Patrick Spence, of course, the CEO of Sonos in just a moment in the meantime. Let's go to the Charlie Pet because lots of Charlie happen. Indeed. We've got it all covered. Let us begin with Gap. Look at that stock surging now by 14% after ours. Gap, the retailer posted quarterly sales and profit that beat Wall Street estimates assigned that the apparel retailer is making progress in controlling an inventory buildup that had eroded investor confidence earlier in the year. Again, after ours, we've got Gap up right now by about 14%. Applied materials, the biggest maker of chip manufacturing equipment delivered a better than feared sales forecast for the current period. As supply chain improvements help offset an economic slowdown. After ours, we got shares of Amat trading unchanged. Palo Alto Networks forecast adjusted EPS for the second quarter. The guidance did beat the average analyst estimate shares of Palo Alto Networks up now by just about 5%. It was a down day on Wall Street today. The Dow, the S&P and Nezdank all declined. As investors watched Fed hawk circle, we saw the S&P 500 index set today down 12 points. Drop there are three tenths of 1%. We've got the Dow down 7. Little changed. Nezdank down today by 38 points dropped there are 4 tenths of 1%.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,326,2022-11-17 21:34:19

There are four tenths of 1%. 10 year yield 3.76% with the two year yielding 4.45%. Gold down 13 dollars. He answered 17 60 drop. There are seven tenths of 1%. While Texas, Texas, and the accrued down 4.3% 81.93%. As for the overall market backdrop, Charlie Massimo is senior VP and financial advisor at wealth enhancement group. I think when you look at the market, it's much more positive and much more constructive now. Meaning the lows are much better than what we've seen a year ago and a week ago or two weeks ago. And the highs are pretty significant on updates. So I think we're starting to see a market that is trying to find direction, but the direction is much more positive than negative right now. Briefly, Visa promoting President Ryan McInerney to CEO replacing Al Kelly as a February 1st and Goldman Sachs upgrading Korea to overweight Hong Kong to market weight will have more of course on daybreak Asia. I'm Charlie. How did that? Is a Bloomberg Business Flash? All right, Charlie. Thank you so much. I want to get back to our guest Patrick Spence still with us. Of course, the CEO of Sonos. We've been talking about the most recent quarter stock was up about I think 3% in today's session. So Patrick, innovation. How do you think about it in the space? We're playing in a few different areas of audio today. So about four different categories. And we are always balancing. Do we do something new to raise the bar in the existing category that we're already playing in or do we expand into a new one? And so we go through really an assessment of kind of where our capabilities are and the opportunities we see in the market. And then we kind of follow our instinct quite frankly in terms of, okay, we think this is somewhere that our customers will want to go with us. And so and our story's really been software eating audio. So where can we bring our system and our software and do something differentiated in a new space or in the space we're in like raise the bar if you will. So you will see us at times bring it things that are new like we did with the Rome like a portable speaker and into a new area or like we've done with Submini recently where, okay, we're going to do something different in a space we're already in. And we try then if we're doing something in the space we're already in to have a good better best approach to our portfolio. So we've got products for a variety of price points and customers and different aesthetic appeals as well. Where's the room left to innovate? This is the thing that I think companies are always looking at and trying to understand where to go next. In our world, we really only play in about 20 billion of the audio market today and our revenue last year was 1.7. So we have a lot of room in the home but then there's a whole bunch of categories beyond that they take us to 96 billion dollars. So as I mentioned yesterday we're investing in the categories that we're already in but we're as well investing in four new ones that we think hold a lot of potential as well. So we're excited that we're working on those and we're looking forward to bring out those products over time too. But I mean apart from getting smaller batteries lasting longer audio quality getting better and you already have speakers for what seemed like to me as a sonos customer kind of every occasion right now. I've heard that for 10 years and we keep coming out with words that reach into you know new customers and new ideas and that's the fun part of the job is to come out with these products that then our our existing customers. So just talking to you guys. What's working on the lab? No, but in the vault. Oh, you know, of course that our customers will go out and buy and that with the tracks new ones right as well. So we're always thinking about how are we servicing those existing customers but at the same time attracting a new set of customers into the products. So it's this you know that this balance kind of that we're doing from year to year in terms of what products we're going to bring out and how we attract more people into the system. But it is a long term view too right like I don't you know next year will be next year for for me the biggest thing is what happens over the next 10 years and so we're investing in you know software and AI and all that all the kind of stuff that everybody knows is happening in tech to make sure that we can bring out products and experiences that will continue to surprise people. How do you deal with? Okay, wait, two questions. Metaverse. Do you think about that? I think I think the the whole idea of augmented reality virtual reality. There's definitely something to that and audio will play a big role. Right. So it's definitely something that we think about today. Don't know exactly what it looks like yet. But you know, we've we're pretty good about partnering with a variety of different companies and trying to figure out our ways into spaces like that. So we're watching it very closely. All right, and I ask this of a lot.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,327,2022-11-17 21:38:28
17714," Yeah, we've we're pretty good about partnering with a variety of different companies and trying to figure out our ways into spaces like that So we're watching it very closely. All right, and I asked this a lot of leaders of publicly held companies Stocks down 42% this year. How do you think about it work it into the conversations? How does the board kind of approach like how do you think about that? And there's a lot of names that are beaten down. Oh, yeah, we're sure 70% from a time. Yeah, so I'm just but I'm curious It's got to be something you keep in mind. Oh, absolutely. It has to be and I think those that claim that they don't I don't think are necessarily being genuine because it is a factor and all of our people, you know, all of our people Get compensation through restricted stock units. So that matters. I feel a responsibility to our people and to our investors And so I think it's important to in these times like really make sure you're telling your story clearly So when we did our earnings call last night We disclosed some data points that we hadn't before around registrations in Natori And as well future products even about the number of categories we're going into to help people better understand where we're going So we can always do a better job I think of telling our story and then there then there are some things that are out of our control in terms of the markets and those kind of things But fundamentally, you know, I do think You have to be mindful of it and then you also have to understand you can't control it But you can control your communications and then the number one thing you can control is your own execution and the ability to actually deliver You know on those things over time and build you know build a real business, right? 30 seconds Patrick your based in Santa Barbara a very desirable place to live not a lot of companies base there Do you have to overpay to attract talent or do you have to do underpay because it is such a desirable place to be so we Through the pandemic we've been hiring all over the United States We pay the same you know salary whether you happen to live in city A or city B As we go through it across the country because I figured as we try to attract you know the the group of like amazing talent a group of Diverse talent that we can why you know if you're doing the same job as somebody in city A versus city B Why would you be paid any differently? I think I'll less than city B well, but but that doesn't mean you should get paid less for your impact at a company You're right I don't know you know like I think it should be I'm just playing devil advocate Yeah, yeah, no I understand but I it's like a personal question But I do think you know people should be paid based on the impact they're having in their organization what a gem come back soon Thank you Patrick spend CEO at Sonas joining us here in our interactive broker studio Let's get to world in national news Denise Peligrini standing by Haydenes Hey there Republicans are getting ready to take over the majority in the house as we've been reporting in current speaker Nancy Pelosi Says she will not be seeking a leadership position next year with great confidence In our caucus I will not seek reelection to democratic leadership in the next Congress and policy did say she is not Retiring she'll continue to serve in the House first and Francisco district House Democrats eager to raise or suspend the Death limit by the end of the year but it now looks like that might happen because of what's happening in the House Bloomberg Zaymi Morris explains now that the GOP has a slim majority in the House Democrats want to tackle the debt ceiling Before the new Congress is sworn in but Republicans aren't very interested in a quick deal Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell says it can wait Democrats don't want to use the reconciliation process not only would it take too long But they'd like a bipartisan deal but waiting may be risky for Democrats as Republicans have said they want to use those Negotiations to finagle fiscally conservative concessions in Washington I may be more as Bloomberg radio alright.

And has this sort of you know epiphany or like a reaction and I'm like okay what did you just see? And it's always some pretty cool story that she wants to talk about and we don't often turn to people magazine or these conversations. People's a great gut check on the world at large. Every day all of us people like just doing things good things bad things, what have you and then it's sometimes it's celebrities doing things like none other than... Well I was going to say people it also has to do with animals. Yeah so I got to kind of love this one. Speak to my heart in so many different ways. So Snoop Dogg the headline on the people's stories. Snoop Dogg launching a pet line Snoop Doggy Dogs featuring hoodies, toys, bowls and accessories. This is a corner of people magazine today. Snoop Doggy Dogs it's items also designed to fit Kat's Carol. So it appeals to... Even though it's Doggy. Cat lovers and dog lovers too. Yeah they're going to... Yeah. Yes they're selling it. Amazon. Yeah. Makes sense. Yeah. Parallel toys, accessories, bowls for their furry friends. Is this on your list for scout? Yeah. I think it's called by Snoop Dogg, yeah. And Hunyak, yeah. Scout and Hunyak. Hunyak, yeah. It's a check with the locking word. It's your new dog. That's your puppy. We call him Yack. Okay so noted there's some nice photos in here. Dalmatian with a Snoop Doggy Dogs collar on it. Hey you know what my question is? But how has it taken so long for Snoop to do this? I don't know. I don't know. I wonder if Martha's involved. They kind of worked together. Yeah they're like big collaborators. Can I say there was a statement for the line's launch and Snoop said if my dog's ain't fresh I ain't fresh. These dogs and they are parallel or a reflection of the dog themselves so they got to look like the role of a top dog you dig. I do. That's really cute. You got to love him.

They are now up by 6 percent gap out of San Francisco posted quarterly sales and profit that topped Wall Street's estimates of sign the apparel retailer is making progress in controlling an inventory buildup that had eroded investor confidence earlier this year. Apply materials right now, they're up by 2.25 percent. Applied is the biggest maker of chip manufacturing equipment. It delivered a better than feared sales forecast for the current period as supply chain improvements help offset an economic slowdown. A down day on Wall Street, the Dow, the S&P and Nez Stack all declining S&P down for a second day. We had federal reserve officials hammering home their resolve to remain persistent in their fight against inflation. Here's where we end of the day with the S&P down 3.1 percent lower by 12. Off-Session lows I should have. We've got the Dow down 7 points today, a little change there. Nez Stack down 38 down by 4.10 percent. 10 year 3.76 percent with a 2 year 4.45 percent. Spot Gold 1760, the ounce down 7.10 percent. Bitcoin up 9.10 percent, 16,684 West Texas, and immediate crude down 4.2 percent, 81.99 a barrel. I'm Charlie Pellett and that is a Bloomberg business flat. All right, Charlie. Thank you so much. Well, our next guest held executive roles at IBM, J&J General Electric, and at G alone, among her senior roles, that included CIO for Global Services. She is out to now with a new book. We're talking about Daphne E. Jones, former senior vice president for Future of Work at GE. The book is called When They Say You Won't. Break through barriers and keep leveling up your success. Daphne joins us via Zoom from New York City. Daphne, good to have you with us. Congratulations on the book. How are you? I'm well, Tim. Hi. How are you? And I, Carol, how are you doing? Doing well. Nice to have you here. Thank you. The thing I'd like to ask when it comes to people like you who've led such interesting and illustrious careers and then decided to write a book is, is that moment that you decided that you needed to write this book? What did you experience throughout your career and there that pivotal moment that you said, wait a second, I've had all these experiences. I need to write a book. Yeah, sort of like what you just said. I mean, I have been wanting to write this book for a long time and I'm a maximizer. I'm a teacher by nature somehow. And I'm always wanting to help me.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,330,2022-11-17 21:51:34
17717," I mean, I have been wanting to write this book for a long time and I'm a maximizer. I'm a teacher by nature somehow and I'm always wanting to help make somebody or something better whether it's a company, an organization, my family, my team, you know, myself. And I said, I can't, I can't hold enough microphones in my hand, you know, to be able to reach the people that I want to reach was I've seen so many women who have been undervalued, overlooked, underappreciated, underpaid. And I found that I was able to systematically systematize how I was able to make it in spite of the issues that I had. And I said, well, how do I get other people to to get where I was sooner than I did and faster than I did and better than I did. And I said the book is the best platform for that, not just my holding a mic all the time. Well, you know, and I think it's time that we're talking about this because, you know, individuals can certainly deal with some setbacks. And sometimes it's losing a job and I'm bringing it up because there's some headlines crossing the Bloomberg and I do want to just bring this out to our audience here at Bloomberg. Amazon.com coming out and saying that there will be more role reduction. So we're talking about more job cuts. Amazon.com doesn't know yet exactly how many roles impacted. This is a note from CEO Andy Jassy about the role of eliminations and saying the decisions to be shared with impacted employees early 2023. Stux just a tad higher in the aftermath. You'll recall from our reporting yesterday at Bloomberg news that some employees were critical of the company's CEO Andy Jassy that he hadn't addressed the employees in a way that Mark Zuckerberg did last week with those mass layoffs. All right. So there's some great context there. Getting back to Daphne Jones who we are talking with. And as we said, former senior VP for future of work at GE and she's got a new book out when when they say you won't break through barriers and keep leveling up your success. You know what's interesting too? And I think about women making their way to the higher echelon of corporate America. You did it at GE but it's not easy. We had a story this week about Goldman Sachs, a payout of over 12 million. And this was to a former partner who lends troubling behavior by bosses and management all the way to the top. And maybe Wall Street is a different kind of industry. What was your experience though as you made your way to the top? Were there some difficult moments? Yeah. I mean, it's really interesting with the fact that we're talking about women. But when you talk about women and people of color, oh my goodness, now you have an intersectionality that's dealing with micro inequities and and other kinds of ways of being mistreated or misunderstood. And so I certainly experienced it. I've been told I've been shown that I that I wasn't going to be able to win. And what I've learned to do and what I think women and others need to be able to do is when you get that feedback, you know, I have a chapter in the book that talks about taking in the meat and spitting out the bones. There are times when you're going to get great feedback that may be critical about you in an it may feel toxic, but it may just be good for you to understand. And so you have to understand take that data, take that feedback, not personally, but take it strategically. Take it as data. And it does it reflect the culture of the kind of company that you want to work for, you know, with the quiet quitting and the great resignation. Employees have really an opportunity to decide their own place, call their own place and decide if this company is the one for them. And so they need to look at the feedback and understand, is this valid or is it because the culture is toxic and I need to get out of there and they have that right to do that. I have to say I love the chapter in your book from stuck to unstuck. There's so many great questions and you ask the question or or present a situation what to do, things like what to do when your comment is restated by a man who gets the credit. What to do when you don't get timely feedback and are surprised by your performance review. I mean, I just this is a very helpful kind of book. What do you think is, you know, we don't have hours because I think we could talk for hours in terms of your advice, but what is the top two pieces of advice you think that, you know, you have for people? Yeah, I would say understand what winning means to you. Winning was told to me what winning was and somebody else's perspective and they define my narrative on your own narrative to find what winning means to you. And number two, I would say",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,331,2022-11-17 21:55:46
17718," It was told to me what winning was in somebody else's perspective and they define my narrative on your own narrative to find what winning means to you. And number two, I would say do that in the context of the five Fs because I, you know, have gone through a divorce before I've, you know, kind of hurt my family, a downsize, things like that. So, you know, is your family okay? Is your faith okay? Is your fitness and financials and then your career should be considered, of course, but you got to do looking at your goals in a, in a bigger context of things that really make you who you are. So, know your goals and make sure that you have great EQ, have great awareness of who you are and how you behave, how you treat people and then show that you have control over how you treat people and how you talk and how you behave. And I think you'll be a better leader when you do that. Hey, Debbie, before we let you go, you were a senior vice president for Future of Work at GE. And if there's one thing that we talk about in this day and age, it is the future of work and, of course, GE as well. From a future of work perspective, though, you know, here we are, a lot of offices around the country are requiring people to come in, maybe two, three days a week or even just working from home remotely, like we just spoke to Patrick Spencer, CEO of Sonos about, what does the future of work look like to you? The future of work looks like less of, I'm going to be in this job for 30 years, 20 years, 10 years, and I'm going to do it based on what gives me pleasure, what allows me to connect with my values. So me being, essentially, a millennial, about a 60 or 50 year old person, they tend to be more loyal. I think the, the, the millennials will call their own play. I think they will want to stay home. They will want to go and work wherever they want to work. They want to spend three months in Hawaii because it's all about the technology and the connectivity of that. Now, it's a great leveling of the playing field because the offices people had clicks that they went in, right? Right. So when you're offline, when you're out of the office, it seems like you have more ability to connect with people and they're not going to have formed these clicks that they do with the lunchroom or whatever. So there's a lot more independence and people would appreciate that. Great points, definitely, Jones. Thank you so much. Check out our new book, Win, when they say you won't break through barriers and keep leveling up your success. All right, folks, that's it for this Thursday. Happy Friday's Eve, Carol. Yeah.

17719," Music I'm Caroline Hyde at Bloomberg's World Headquarters in New York. And I'm Ed Lodlow in San Francisco. This is Bloomberg technology. Coming up the man behind Enron's liquidation and now FTX's CEO, he says the prior management of the disgraced crypto empire is the worst he's ever seen. This is lawyers overseeing the FTX bankruptcy. Sam McWenfried's tweeting is hurting their case. Then, Cisco's CFO joins us to talk about their earnings beat supply chain improvements and why the need for job cuts. And we're a week away from the official start of holiday shopping season. The digital strategy for retailers is more important than ever. May CCO joins exclusively to talk about expectations. But first, but foremost, a check on those markets because, well, as borrowing costs rise, it means those most interest rate responsive stocks they fall. Yes, that is technology. I'm looking at S&P 500 by 310% in the NASDAQ closing off by 310% as well. Big tech was in the line of fire as we see yields for shy. This is where the main volatility was. The boron market. Once again, the two-year yield pushing up some nine. Let's call it 10 basis points on the day. That is, we once again hear the narrative coming from the Federal Reserve. We thank Bullard. We thank Daily. We thank some of the other cash curries of the world. Signing more hawkish all over again. We're thinking, of course, of the fact that the market, the economy in some way, still looks pretty strong. Jobless claims today. Once again, coming in lower than expected, showing that that jobs market is still very resilient. So we hear that push back against the narrative that maybe the Federal Reserve is for turning. And instead, we look at boron cost pushing higher, particularly on the front end. Let's kick it on again, because actually this mood music turning sour was not the case everywhere. In China, money still going into that market as many anticipate perhaps the unwinding of those COVID policies. Some say now the market is overdone. Just check out this move ed on one month. We have seen a 20% increase in the internet stocks that, of course, track by the ETF crane shares of China. That's the key ETF that we track here in the US. Clearly, money moving into those sorts of areas still. Yeah, I'm going to look at Alibaba later in the show, but it's hard on a day where particularly technology investors are really focused on the Fed and the outlook for rates to talk about the reasonable rhyme between single names. Cisco is really an earning store, no, sorry, right? Bullish outlook for revenue in the quarter, but they're talking about job cuts, even with such a bullish outlook. We're going to speak to the CFO very shortly, and I think that's a key question. elsewhere, Airbnb out with news that they're bringing new tools to basically expand inventory on the platform, not helping the stock down 5%. Elsewhere, Amazon and Tesla, the biggest drags from a points perspective on the NASDAQ 100, crypto, crypto, crypto, crypto, help, you want me to keep going crypto? That's the story right now, the contagion. What's interesting, specific tokens kind of starting to stabilize? I look particularly though, it's Salana as an example, right?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,333,2022-11-17 22:04:36
17720," kind of starting to stabilize. I look particularly though at Salana is an example, right? Salana very closely tied to the FTX empire. This is a token that was trading at a 40-hand or before all this standard started. Now we're down at 13. We've stabilized, but we're not being pulled in Ivedirection. I think everyone right now with this story and FTX is collapsed is in weight and sea mode because we don't really understand the full extent of what's happening. Fagling exhausted, emotionally exhausted, physically exhausted, from all the tweets that we have to, of course, read. Let's talk about the FTX empire collapse a little bit more if you can bear it because FTX's new CEO has been slamming the non-existent oversight, the misuse of client funds and saying that they're struggling to locate billions of dollars in missing assets. The most Katie Griefeld is here with the shock that awe when we read of course that bankruptcy statement coming finally Katie. What did you make of some of the more sensational parts? Well, it's amazing because this is just day one. This is the first thing that we've seen from John Jay Ray III and I like you highlighted at the top. Again, this was the man who helped liquidate and Ron who drove that saying that this is a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information. So really slamming the record keeping that was going on and what it caught my eye and I mean it was just a treasure trove, this sworn declaration, but he also took task to test the concentration of control as well. It sounds like a lot of it rested with SPF, which is a small handful of people. You can buy that with sort of shoddy record keeping and here you are. A big part of this story Katie is looking for things and not knowing where they are. The administrators are looking at FTX's empire, the digital assets that they held on behalf of clients and themselves and saying where are they? It's a very pressing question. So far we know they were able to locate about 740 million worth of cryptocurrency in cold wallets. They also found about 560 million dollars in cash. You add that together. I'm not too good at math, but we're still missing billions of dollars there. And again, like we were saying, the record keeping was very half-hearted. It was very messy. Again, according to the sworn declaration. So that's a puzzle that needs to be solved. And then you think about how this is actually going to be distributed to the different creditors of which there are more than a million dollars. And it's quite a process. More questions and answers. We tried to get some answers. From our viewers, you out there, you responded to us on Twitter. We love it because we put the polls out to you early in the morning. And we wanted to get a gauge of really what is the most extraordinary part of all of this thus far? Is it the CEO's new CEO's reaction that you just spelled out for us Katie? Is it Samatman for eat himself? The ongoing Twitter narrative? The cryptic tweets? Is it the fact that of course he's now facing questioning in the US from an legal perspective? And fact, most people thought it's all crazy. It's only feels all crazy. What are the tidbits can you bring us that have just been totally sensational? I mean, it's got to be the tweets, right? The fact that it's just tweeting through it. It's really amazing. You can find that with the DMs to that incredible report from Vox. But just focusing on the tweeting. Again, FTX's lawyers citing his quote, incessant and disruptive tweeting while accusing SPF of undermining the bankruptcy case. I mean, it escapes me another example of something like this. It's when I think there was potential photographic evidence. I mean, him just in a supermarket. And the harm is we got in the same Twitter circle. Later night, too late at night. Katie Griefeld, we thank her for being so on top of this story. I want to get you more really perspective here on the ramifications on the entire ecosystem. I'm really pleased and welcome back to the show Jill Gunter, she's a course chief strategy officer in espresso systems. A company providing scaling privacy systems for web three applications. Jill, great to have your voice on this because you've been someone who helped really put money to work in the space when you're at sort of ventures now, really building out the ecosystem. How much of a knock has it had across the entirety of not just exchanges, but more broadly? Yeah, I've been fortunate to be in this space in some capacity for the last decade now. As you mentioned, whether that's on the investing side, we're now on the building side with espresso systems. And I have to say I have never seen a tragedy of this scale. I think it's a tragedy.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,334,2022-11-17 22:08:52
17721," whether that's on the investing side or now on the building side with the espresso systems. And I have to say I have never seen a tragedy of this scale. I think it's a tragedy for the retail investors who came into this space and put money to work with SPF and with FTX and who didn't fully understand what the mission of crypto was about. And I think it's also a tragedy for the crypto industry as a whole that it's being dragged down by the acts that it seemed to be at least at this point fraudulent and criminal on on the part of just a few actors in this space. FTX is not crypto, it's not representative of the industry and it's not what the industry was founded to solve. Jill, I've been excited to talk to you because you cover basically the entire ecosystem of what's falling apart here, right? Yes, your CSO, it is espresso, but you also are essentially adventure capitalists. You've invested in other crypto startups. Could you tell Caroline and I what conversations you're having with all your friends behind the scene, everyone that you know in this industry? What are people talking to each other about? I think that the biggest takeaway amongst builders in this space of which I'm lucky to be one is that again this is not what crypto is about. Crypto is a technology that was founded to bring accountability, openness, transparency to financial systems. It was founded if you look back at the Bitcoin white paper which was sort of the advent of the space as a whole created in 2008 in the wake of the financial crisis that was playing out then. It was created to reduce the necessity to trust middlemen with your finances and with your assets. Unfortunately, I will say that I think crypto as an industry has fallen short in a few capacities. One of which is that we have yet to build good enough user experience around the products that we've built that truly do take advantage of the openness, transparency and accountability that it can offer. Because of that, people have trusted their assets to centralized exchanges like FTX and they have gotten lost on what the actual core value proposition of the technology is. They've also gotten caught up in the speculative hype around crypto as an asset class while losing track of its value proposition again as a technology. And I think amongst builders in the space, amongst the entrepreneurs out there who've been building whether it's for six months or six years in this space, there is simultaneously a feeling of despondency that this is the mainstream view of crypto right now is that SBF and FTX are somehow representative of it. But there is also a real feeling of galvanization that this is our opportunity and that if anything, this should drive home to people why the core value prop of crypto is actually necessary, why we do want technologies that reduce trust in middlemen and trusted intermediaries that SBF purported to be among. Passionately said Jill and there is a lot of passion and there is a lot of anger rising but there's also a lot of committed capital that's still there in venture. I'm interested as to whether we've heard of perhaps the institutional players who are looking and besting in the actual asset class perhaps pulling back. But what about those that are building, like yourself at the moment? Are you worried about those checks that have been being built up and are ready to be deployed? Are they still being cut for companies such as yours? My sense is yes, my sense is that there will be I think rightly an increase in scrutiny and diligence being done around companies. I think that the standards will also be raised to ensure that companies are not just building another casino but instead are building for real utility, real value and real sustainable revenue and business models that aren't just founded on a pyramid of tokens. I for one welcome that. I think many builders in the space welcome that as well. I think that that level of diligence has been missing for a while. I think that there are many reasons for that. I think that people had the sense over the last decade really that there was easy money to be made. That was a combination of everything from interest rates to again a speculative bubble really around nascent and poorly understood technology.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,335,2022-11-17 22:13:09
17722," That was a combination of everything from interest rates to, again, a speculative bubble really around a nascent and poorly understood technology. And I think that that's all been washed out from the investor side. And I think that that's a good thing. I think we're just getting this conversation started more to come. Jil Gunn, to Chief Strategy Officer, Addispresso Systems. Thank you. Coming up, Cisco beating expectations and raising its full year forecast, but it's also the latest tech company announcing job cuts. More on that next with Cisco's CFO, Scott Heron. And speaking of which, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy shared there will be more role reductions, but that they do not know yet exactly how many roles will be impacted. Bloomberg reported earlier this week that Amazon would cut as many as 10,000 staff as soon as this week focused on the devices, business, retail and HR. This is Bloomberg Technology. The hardest part for me as somebody being on the organization side of layoffs is that you know that people's lives are at stake. And if you are an empathetic person, which I for better or worse, you can't help but think about the impact that this is going to have on the people who have a job one day and not the next day. This is Camilla Boyer. She had the misfortune of working at three companies in the space of nine months that did layoffs. While there is definitely not a good way of firing people, there is absolutely a bad way. There's three really important things to bear in mind. First of all, don't fire a mass number of people over Zoom or over email. Don't diminish their contribution to the company. Make sure you're showing gratitude for the time and effort and love in lots of cases that people have put into their jobs at that company. It's much harder to trust a leader who isn't capable of owning their own fallibility than it is to trust one who will own up to their mistakes and be willing to kind of take that on board and move forward. Accountability. Empathy, closure. It's really important to treat the people who are being",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,336,2022-11-17 22:17:43
17723," Empathy, closure. It's really important to treat the people who are being laid off with that respect, giving the people impacted a chance to say goodbye, treating them in that human way, and not just cutting them off from every system right away, goes a long way towards the experience of both the people who are leaving and the people who are remaining in terms of that ability to move on. That was Quick Takes, Alex Webb, and CheckOut.com's Camilla Boyer. And Tech Layoffs are in the air. Bloomberg TV also spoke to Airbnb's Brian Chesky earlier. Here's what he had to say about job cuts. Two and a half years ago, we lost 80% of our business. We laid off 25% of our employees. And I said at that time that we are going to be now prepared for anything to come, any storm. And so we stayed really disciplined for the last two and a half years, anticipating difficult times ahead. And we said no matter what happens to the economy, we do not want to have to change how we run the company. And that's only possible if we stay lean and we stay disciplined. And we only have about 6,000 employees. So we're really lean. Begin the year, we were only planning to hire 7% more people than the year before. When many other tech companies that weren't growing even as fast as us, we're going to hire 20%, 30% more people. So because of that, and because of the strength of our business, we are not stepping on the brakes. In fact, we're stepping on the gas. We are still hiring. We're not freezing. We're not cutting. We're growing. That was Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky. And speaking of tech layoffs, Cisco closed 4.7% higher on Thursday after giving an upbeat quarterly revenue forecast. And like many other tech companies right now, unveiling a plan to cut jobs. CFO Scott Heron joins us now for more. Scott, let's push this forward, right? Bullish outlook for the last three months of this year. But at the same time, you're acknowledging a changing macro picture. You're preparing for the worst. How do you balance that? Yeah, and in our case, I think it's a little bit different. And first of all, thanks for having me on the call. It's great to see you both again. I'm a big fan. I should start there. We had a great first quarter. It was record high, a record early revenues for us. Erning's per share and revenues above the high end of our guidance range. And it's really on the back of a lot of hard work we've been doing over the last 18 months to build a recurring revenue model and to manage the supply chain issue. So the performance is actually quite good of the company. We did announce a small restructuring today. And it's really about two things. And I think it's a bit different than the way perhaps you've heard from other companies. ours is really about rebalancing. The number of headcount we had at the beginning of the year, we asked the mate, we're going to have the same number of heads at the end of the year. What we're doing is trying to marshal more resources and focus more into a couple of key areas, which of course means we have to come down to some other areas. So we're focusing more on platforms and cloud delivered capabilities within our networking business and insecurity. Our goal through internal placement, by the way, is to place as many of those who are displaced on the low end of that into some of the open jobs on the other end. So this is not a cost-motivated, a cost savings-motivated restructuring for us. Talk to us there for about security, about cloud, Scott. Are they the two areas that a corporate, a government agency, a client of yours cannot do without why the bullishness into this deterioring outlet? Yeah, I think it's a couple of things. It's a great question. And one of them I just talked about, we are more than 40% of our revenues now are recurring. Right? And so we've built up more than $30 billion of remaining performance obligations. You hear the phrase RPO, right? That's sales that we've transacted that haven't yet shown up in our revenue stream. So we start each quarter with a nice recurring revenue base. We also, through the last year, because of some of the supply concerns, have built up a significant order backlog. When you put those two together and demand is what demand is, we had the second highest Q1 in terms of product orders that we've had in our history, second only to Q1 a year ago. And so we continue to see good demand. We've got a base of recurring revenue and we've got a backlog. So we have great visibility into the next several quarters. Traditionally, Cisco is viewed as this sort of legacy tech name, not so exciting, Scott, if you don't mind me saying, you know, that's the sell side's kind of take on Cisco.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,337,2022-11-17 22:22:00
17724," Cisco is viewed as this sort of legacy tech name, not so exciting Scott, if you don't mind me saying, you know, that's the cell sides kind of take on Cisco. But you are trying to do something new, move into services, recurring revenue. Be more in everyone's face every day. How's that going? It's going great. You know, it's one of the reasons that I think you hear the bullish outlook from us in a time when there's a fair amount of uncertainty. 43% of our revenues, I'll say it again, 43% of our revenues are coming from recurring revenue models. That is subscriptions, it's SaaS, it's some of the recurring revenue models attached to some of the hardware that we ship out. And frankly, as I said, we've built up a pretty large order backlog, trapped in there as another $2 billion worth of recurred with a software revenue trapped in that backlog. So I think it's gone well. There's room for us to accelerate that even further. Let's talk about what Anna is saying. I like the way Ed sort of paraphrases it, but city is keeping you on a cell. And city group is saying they're worried about the order growth remaining negative down 14%. What do you say to that? I say what I said earlier, Caroline, it was down in the first quarter on a year on your basis by 14%. Compared to a Q1 last year that was up 34%. And so it's hard to, the compare point is actually part of why just the arithmetic gives you that. I think the better way to look at it then is what's happening sequentially. When you've got an anomaly quarter that we're comparing to. And by the way, our fourth quarter of last year, our first and second quarter, both had greater than all three had greater than 30% growth. So in each case, the arithmetic is going to look tough. I think the better way to gauge what's really happening in terms of customer demand is, okay, how do the sequentials compare to what you've seen historically? And from that standpoint, it was pretty much in line, slightly below, but pretty much in line what we'd seen as a historical range going from it was our fourth quarter, by the way, to our first quarter that we just announced. So the sequentials look fine. And as I said, it was the second highest Q1 in terms of product orders. We've had in the history of the company and to be fair, city group doesn't say it's difficult year on year comps. We thank you for spelling that out for us at SCO CFO Scott, Heron, great to have some time with you. Keep on watching. We appreciate it. Meanwhile, coming up, what's new in the VC world will get the latest global headlines. That's next. And before we had to break a softer tone, apparently coming from one Elon Musk, according to people familiar with the matter, Musk is now attempting to retain Twitter staffers by actually softening his remote work mandate. This comes as apparently fewer workers are opting in to the next chapter of Twitter. Let's bring back.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,338,2022-11-17 22:26:24

17727," business and capital allocation is investing in the business. So to your question, we're deeply committed to ensuring that our top notch in digital, that we've got a modernized supply chain that can accommodate that, that our stores are in great shape, that we're investing in our team of people of colleagues. And that's serving us well. So we have not stepped back from that. So we're spending about a billion to in our capex budget in 2020, 2022. And that's been about our averages about the one billion range. You can expect us to spend that in future years because, you know, retail is about investment. And we've got to make sure that we're ready for the customer, however, they're going to change. In digital technology, supply chain are places that have given us a good return on that investment. Macie CEO Jeff get out there. Now for more on online retail environment that we're currently within, we want to bring in Rachel Tenbrink, she's general partner and co-founder of Red Bite Capital, which invests in early stage growth startups in Fintech in e-commerce marketplaces. Rachel, it's great to have you here in the studio with us. And a lot of that, the focus of Macie's, a lot of what they're doing well is their inventory. But how is the build up in other companies' inventory going to affect us from an e-commerce perspective as well? Thank you for having me. I think what's going on is that the retailers had such a bad experience last year where they were so understocked, they were so desperate. So on the one hand, it was good because they didn't have to discount. Whatever was there was what the consumer was buying, there was nothing left. The flip side of that is that this year, they've bought sort of preemptively and deeper levels of stock. And what you're seeing is the consumer is feeling the pinch of inflation. So they're out looking for deals, they're out looking for sales, and the retailers can't risk being stuck with loads of inventory after the holidays. Rachel, good to see you. You said their preempts. You talked about preempts in inventories. Didn't Amazon also kind of preempt the entire season with an additional prime window? Absolutely. You're seeing that overall. Sales are happening earlier and earlier than ever before. As you said, Amazon started their prime day in October, which had never been done before. You're also seeing Walmart doing digital deals. They're doing digital deals every Monday of November and offering early access to their Walmart plus sort of prime comparison connection. So what you're seeing is consumers are starting to buy earlier. And you're seeing that e-commerce brands that started those deals earlier are fairing okay. The ones that started sort of Veterans Day, you know, a couple of weeks ago, whereas the ones that are just starting now, they're off to a slow start. Rachel, what's interesting is with Macy's where they see the differences, perhaps sales falling at the overall Macy's brand, sales climbing at the more luxurious end, blooming sales, a blue mercury. How are you going to see the different income brackets impact different e-commerce players here? So I think that the question it applies to all brackets in that everybody's making trade-offs in what things they're going to spend in and what things they're not. I think that when you're looking at the lower end, the lower bracket, they're going to go for that accessible luxury, but they might look for an item that's under $100. So maybe it's a luxury lipstick, maybe it's a luxury, you know, small accessory. So the lower end is going to strive to sort of do fewer nicer, but accessible luxury. I think at the upper, upper end, you always have a certain segment of population that isn't affected, right, by price increases, that isn't truly feeling the pinch of inflation. So you see things like LVMH continue to fare very well. Rachel, you've had a pretty storied career at some of the giants of consumer goods retail, but you're now investing on the sort of start-up end of the curve when it comes to e-commerce. Is there an opportunity here? Lots of layoffs from the big tech names, people looking to invest in technologies that make them more nimble, what is the e-commerce landscape outside of an Amazon? So it's an interesting time adventure because it's a tough time adventure and particularly for consumer and particularly for consumer tech. So what you're seeing is a lot of consumer D to C brands are being very judicious with their spend, not only because they're concerned about the consumer and worried about that this might be a more tapered holiday season, but number two, they're trying to extend their runway. They know that they need to show strong numbers to their investors. They need to show a positive",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,341,2022-11-17 22:39:18
17728," more tapered holiday season, but number two, they're trying to extend their runway. They know that they need to show strong numbers to their investors. They need to show a positive pack to LTV ratio. And so they're being really thoughtful about how much paid spend they're using, thinking about how they can acquire customers more cost effectively, what channels to use, et cetera. We were all having a bit of a laugh today about Trezame's ad on YouTube, about going into the metaverse and it looked deeply awkward and uncomfortable for this fake virtual model to be waltzing herself down some sort of catwalk. Overall, what are the innovations being made to make us want to shop in a more exciting, different way, but that actually is making us purchase not having a giggle? I think part of it is, I think there's a shift right now in that we've all been sort of trapped at home for so long and even the people that are permanently shifting to shop to work from home are starting to look, think about shopping as entertainment. And so I think you will continue to see more retail concepts, more shopping as an experience. I was just reading about Starbucks taking over three floors of the Empire State Building as just somewhere interesting to go and shop for your coffee. So I think you're going to see more innovation in retail spaces, becoming more engaging, more integrating technology to make it more interesting. I do think that retailer brands will continue to experiment and whether the metaverse as it stands today is going to truly pan out. I think brands will continue to experiment because that's what attracts new consumers. We want to thank Rachel so much for Rachel Timbrink, General Partner and co-founder of Redbike Capital. Check her out. Meanwhile, coming up, how regulatory priorities are changing in the wake of the FTX blow-up. So much more on this debacle.

17729," MUSIC FTX. Let's talk about it again. Look at it as creating a headache for most, if not all, of crypto right now. Let's get right to Rimo Chaneli Basak, as well as Ether Capital CEO Brian Mussoff. Ether Capital, of course, holding about $53 million in the Ethiopian's half of which are staked. And Chaneli, I want you to take the first question. Thank you so much Caroline and Brian, thank you for joining us because obviously a lot of questions around what happens to the crypto universe from here. There's a lot of logic here about DeFi, really coming out on top here, but I'm wondering where does that logic hold and where does it break down? I think there's no question that in the long term, we need both worlds. We need easy access points for consumers, retail investors, institutions who aren't comfortable holding the assets themselves or playing around in DeFi, but I think some people have lost the narrative along the years who've decided to just trust these centralized entities, whether they were regulated or not regulated here in the US or in a foreign jurisdiction. And so people are going to go out, they're going to do more research, they're going to hold these firms more accountable, they're going to demand more transparency, and there's going to be access points, but they're certainly paying in the short term as the industry figures out how to go through this turmoil and build itself back in a much better way. As always, unfortunately, retail often get hurt by this. What's been so extraordinary about the FTX tobacco is how many very wealthy, very sophisticated investors have also been duped. How is institutional investing appetite right now in this space? I think it's pretty safe to say it's either pens down or people are going to take a pause on writing checks, they're going to decide to vet the teams, whoever they're going to invest in, decide if it's appropriate. I think maybe institutions are going to start to look towards holding tokens instead of investing in the picks and shovels. I've been saying for years that there isn't likely a universe where the centralized entity does really well, but Bitcoin and Ether fail, but there is a world where the centralized entity who's trying to insert agency or rent extraction in between this technology that's all about peer-to-peer transactions. That's what it's all about, is not trusting some central authority, but some institutions are unable to hold it because maybe there's a mandate internally where they're not allowed to hold the assets direct and so the way to play the space has been to invest in companies, and maybe they're going to shift their attention back towards the blue chips. Bitcoin, Ether, take a long view. The opportunity around staking is very appealing because you can generate yield off holding that asset. So I think that there's going to be a recalibration that happens here. Talk to us about the staking and the yield farming, and in that respect, the tainted element of that, because many would just say, look, it was too good to be true, and thus it was. We also have to separate that the failure here is not crypto itself. Bitcoin is fine, Ethereum is fine, the price may be blemished, but this is just bad actors, poor governance, central authority, this happens in traditional finance all the time. By the way, there's no regulation that can prevent what happened. You can put up maybe better bumpers, better guardrails, but if you had bad actors internally at the C-suite level and bad management and lack of oversight, someone who's nefariously intentionally trying to do something, it's going to happen regardless of what paper they signed and what they filed in a certain jurisdiction. Do I think we can get better? 100%. In terms of staking, people again, if they go and they hold the token direct, they buy some ether, that's what we've done at Ether Capital, the opportunity to generate 4% to 6% while holding your asset and securing the network, validating transactions. 4% to 6% you can get on a treasury now. But they're different things, because people aren't buying ether and staking it because they're trying to capture just this 4% to 6% yield. These are people who are long the technology, they believe in a credibly neutral protocol that's going to confirm a number of activities, whether it's defy, NFTs, Metaverse, Stablecoin, Movement, and they're saying while I have this low time preference on the asset, why wouldn't I want 4% to 6%? Yes, it is denominated in that token, but it's an attractive opportunity. 4% to 6%, you've actually seen yields jump meaningfully higher and as a banking reporter for a long time, there's no free lunch. 10% is very hard to-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,343,2022-11-17 22:47:55
17730," Tractive opportunity. Forty six percent you've actually seen yields jump meaningfully higher and as a banking reporter here for a long time there's no free lunch. Ten percent is very hard to sustain higher than that 20 percent can be very hard to sustain. How sustainable are these surges in yields and do you get concerned when you look at a curve pool for example and see imbalances starting to form? So first of all the yield has never gone to ten to twenty percent. The yield is a calculation based on how many other participants on the network are staking their asset. How many transactions are taking place on the network at any given time and they're paying a small transaction fee to have whatever their activity is validated inside of a block. So the yield's going to bounce around. Whether they stay up at six percent or drop to two percent I don't know. I would say though that staking different than going into DeFi, different into lending platform rather than centralized or on chain offer the lowest risk rate you can get. It's not completely risk free but it's effectively a bond with the protocol and that's as safe as you can basically get other than just holding the eith and looking away. How do you feel for example let's talk about actors in the space for a minute you have the FTX hacker who emerged with a large stack of ether. When somebody is amassing ether at that kind of a rate and you don't know who it is what are the concerns behind that. I mean the concerns are you have a company that filed for chapter 11 just hours before that and how was that authorized. Who had access to the internal controls to allow a wallet to move hundreds of millions of dollars out of the exchange. I think DeFi did its thing if you stayed up on Friday night, I think it was Friday night like me because it was wild to watch in real time on Twitter. The entire community following those assets as they were trying to be moved through various protocols and swapped into different assets, different funds. People still don't know necessarily who it is but DeFi had that transparency in time will hopefully find out who that was. It's very difficult to hide in the space and again when they try and touch some centralized exchange to cash out whether it's now or in the future between on chain analytics and KYC that's been put in place they will be brought to justice. Understanding that this space is going to be volatile for a while longer what is the risk to the downside here. The risk to the downside is that retail investors and institutions that were just warming up to the asset class have been spooked. They're not sure what a credible access point is going to be. Certainly FTX was one of the most trusted brands in the space. SBF was a face who was often seen in the media talking about crypto, talking about regulation and so people are going to go back to the drawing board. Do their homework and decide again? Do they want exposure? Do they believe in the technology long term? What's an appropriate access point? Do they have some transparency on how they do custody that the customer funds are segregated and so again the industry will emerge better because of this but there is potentially a lot of downsides still to come as whoever does need liquidity in the short term tries to sell their assets. I'm bumpy right ahead but I'm liking going long homework. If the capital CEO Brian Mosoff we thank him. We're in Berkshire Nalybassak. We always thank her.

17733," aman The Great Sci-fi Art of the mid-20th century teased a vision of the future with one distinct element and common, a life for humans in outer space. Whether vacationing on an exotic new planet or commuting to the moon for business, space travel seemed like it was just around the corner. Yet here we are, a half century later, and only about 500 human beings have ever left the bounds of Earth's atmosphere. But thanks to a set of ambitious private companies betting on the promise of space tourism, that long-awaited future could be here sooner than we think. For most of the history of spaceflight, governments have been the prime force behind nearly every aspect, from planning to funding to cruise selection. But as early as the 1980s, proposals for commercial space tourism began to emerge, along with innovative solutions for getting people there, such as the wild concept of sticking a 74-person passenger cabin in the cargo bay of a NASA space shuttle. Although various non-astronauts have been selected for missions over the years, true space tourism didn't happen until 2001. When an entrepreneur named Dennis Tito coughed up an estimated $20 million to hitch a ride with the Russian Federal Space Agency for a week-long vacation aboard the International Space Station. Twenty years later, we're seeing a new contender in this final frontier of tourism. Private companies. It's becoming a private enterprise situation, still very high risk with the high-reward, potential reward. But, you know, government is really out of the business of flying people now, and it's really going to be companies like Elon Musk, Fidgeth Bezos, and Richard Branson that do that heavy lifting. Global space tourism is usually about taking the non-astronaut, the private citizen into an orbital or suborbital flight. So, you get a short amount of microgravity experience, and you can float and take some photos. And then you come back. This was something that technology had gotten to a point where the private sector was going to make a business out of this. There are multiple companies that want to get to the place where they fly people into space. The first of these is Blue Origin, founded in 2000 by Jeff Bezos. Using the autonomous rocket system New Shepherd, a tribute to the first American in space, Blue Origin plans to launch up to six passengers at a time, offering a rarefied treat of 62 mile high views and a momentary experience of weightlessness. Boaking officially kicked off in May 2021, with the very first C to be auctioned off for charity. Meanwhile, Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic has also been pursuing a viable form of suborbital tourism. Aiming for a launch in 2022, once Sir Richard himself has taken flight. I'm hoping to be able to go to space. I'd love to be able to coincide it with the moon landing and go to space. So, I've got the whip on the team and we'll see how we go. The company claims to have lined up over 600 seat reservations so far, including Justin Bieber and Leonardo DiCaprio. Virgin has projected that the final cost of the ticket will be at least $250,000, or roughly $50,000 for each of the five minutes or so of weightlessness that you'll get to experience. Although costly, both companies' offerings aim to make suborbital flight a regular form of adventure travel, eventually driving down costs at scale to expand the customer base beyond the orbit of celebrities and billionaires. The third major contender is Elon Musk's SpaceX, which has set its sights even higher on orbital flights, which are... A whole, another level of complexity and energy and danger. When you go suborbital, if you're just going to go up above the Von Kermann line, which is 100 kilometers, or about 62 miles, you only need to get up to maybe 5,000 miles an hour to get up there and you go basically straight up and then straight back...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,347,2022-11-17 23:05:16
17734," kilometers or about 62 miles. You don't need to get up to maybe 5,000 miles an hour to get up there and you go basically straight up and then straight back down. You don't have the reentry heating that you would see coming in from an orbital. So when you go orbital, I don't care if you're a baseball or a battleship. You've got to go 17,500 miles per hour, not just 5,000 miles an hour. The energy is involved or much greater by doing that SpaceX has gone another level up and that's what they're doing with the Inspiration4. Visit Inspiration4.com for your chance to go to space. Inspiration4 is the first planned all-civilian mission into orbit slated to launch in late 2021. The crew will bring their own set of diverse perspectives and backgrounds and experiences to test how a group of different people, namely people who aren't professional astronauts, could affair in space. Until now astronauts have had to be physically perfect and this mission is changing that and so I feel incredibly honored to to be representing those who aren't physically perfect. At H10 I was diagnosed with bone cancer and I was treated at St.G. Children's Research Hospital and I spent a year there undergoing intense chemo and also surgery that ultimately saved my leg. I now work at St. Jude as a PA, a physician assistant and I work with leukemia and lymphoma patients. The kids we work with are so brave and they are very excited to watch me go to space because this is showing them that they're capable of doing this as well. Haley, along with three other crew members, will spend three days in space orbiting the Earth every 90 minutes before landing back off the coast of Florida. Well, when you think about access, the first astronauts for the United States came from the test pilot side and so women weren't allowed to be a part of that. We have somebody in their 20s, somebody in their 30s, somebody in 40s and somebody in their 50s and so there can be access in all kinds of way whether you're talking about age, whether you're talking about gender, what are you talking about race and ethnicity and all of those things. The first time people are going up into space and not sent there by a superpower, like the United States or Russia or China, well that's like really significant and you've got to be very thoughtful about it. The whole game plan right now is to make space really affordable and accessible for everybody so you can have fishing buddies going to space someday but the first is special and so with that we wanted to have a crew selection process that could make space available to everyday people. Getting to space is only the first step for space tourism. The next challenge is what to do and where to stay when you get there. Axiom space is planning to launch the first segment of a new commercial space station in 2024. There are two billion dollar project called AxStation will become the first free-flying private international space station or to use a more consumer friendly term. A space hotel. Axiom isn't the only company out to make your space stay a little more comfortable. Big low aerospace has been building what they call expandable habitat technology like their B330, an inflatable pod module that expands once in orbit. There's even one attached to a national space station right now they've been testing and you take it up and it's rather small and then you inflate it and it seems to be working very very well. This is likely to be the first kind of tourist hotel that you're going to see up in space. First of all it's easy to carry instead of this giant tin can with all of that. The inflatable are lighter you can just blow them up and they get a nice big size for about half the less than half the weight probably. But even as space missions become accessible to civilians. The risks of going into space are incredibly high and you could die a thousand ways that we can think of and a thousand other ways that we can't think of. This is Michelle Hanlon. She's a space lawyer at the Mississippi School of Law focused on protecting humans in outer space. Now I'm not in the turning for any of the space tours so I haven't been privy to their private contracts but I can tell you that the FAA requires certain waivers to be in those contracts. So for example the FAA says well we're not going to make you make your spacecraft to a certain safety level. We are going to make you spacecraft.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,348,2022-11-17 23:09:34
17735," To be in those contracts, so for example, the FAA says, well, we're not going to make you make your spacecraft to a certain safety level. We are going to make you spacecraft operator. Make sure that you inform your space tours of all of the hazards that you know of. That I imagine a very long waiver all the ways you can die in space. And you have to understand that there's health risks and you have to indemnify the US government if you are launching from the United States. So those are things that we know a space tourist has to sign and has to wave. So now let's go back and think about our space flight participants. The FAA calls space tourists space flight participants. They don't call them astronauts. Why is that important? If you're not an astronaut, there's no obligation to rescue you if something goes wrong. It's a lot of money to set up a rescue launch. If it can even be done, it's something really important to think about in that difference as we cross this threshold from having astronauts in space to having real people like me in space. And when we are able to make it to space reliably enough, there's still a host of other legal and ethical issues to consider before space tourism can truly take off. There are so many gaps in space law that we are going to have to put in a lot of sort of basement ideas. And so for example, the outer space treaty is a treaty that offers principles and guidelines for state activities, for the activities of national governments. Doesn't talk about private entities. Doesn't talk about humans in space. So now something goes wrong. So let's think about all the times hotels on Earth are sued. So slip and false. You step on something in the bathroom. You sue the hotel and it becomes a private lawsuit. Because of the vagaries of international law, if something happens in space, well, boy, you consume the state that launched your spacecraft. You consume the company that brought you there. You consume the hotel. You consume the individual. You consume every government related to that. Because the way it leads the outer space treaty and the outer space regime have set this up is that anything that happens in space first has to go through a diplomatic channel before you think about suing in a court of law. And so every single slip and fall in a space hotel is a diplomatic nightmare. And so we really need to figure that out before we start sending a lot of people there. You think about human rights in space. Here, we don't think about a human rights oxygen because it's all around us some free. It's not in a space hotel. So what happens if something happens in the oxygen depletes, who gets the oxygen first? And then, of course, let's not even think about the labor. How do you treat your labor in a space hotel where that person may be there two or three years without coming back to Earth? So a lot of things to think about. Space habitats are more likely in the near future to focus on research missions and be a home for experiments that can't happen as easily back on Earth. Space hotels, I think they garnered a lot of headlines and a lot of news. But at the same time, that's not the first thing that you're going to see happen. They don't offer the compelling business case. I think that you'll see from a place that wants to manufacture pharmaceuticals or a new type of crystal or some type of filament or fiber optic cables and other things that you can do with microgravity. The things that are actually a high value finished good, when you get that back to Earth and you sell it for a very, very huge profit margin, that's what's likely to happen in space as opposed to having a real estate platform that you sell to a tourist, a space hotel. It's really interesting and it will probably happen, but it's not likely to be at the forefront of space commerce. Even if space hotels are right around the corner, don't get too excited about booking a trip in one. It's not a cheap ticket to ride to space and it's going to be, you know, millionaires and billionaires and that sort. But at the same time, you know, the point was made that in the early days of airline trips, that was also a completely unaffordable ticket for most people. Those people who flew were people of means and over time it becomes affordable to the masses. And I think that's the goal for all the entrepreneurs in space as well to get those costs down to a point where it's not $10 million or $5 million or $300,000 riding the suburb.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,349,2022-11-17 23:13:59
17736," It's not $10 million or $5 million or $300,000 right into sub-ordinal space when it becomes more light buying a first-class ticket to go to Europe from the United States. So that's the goal and you know, the question is, can we get to that point? Given the immense operating cost of getting to space, it may be years, if ever, until space tours and becomes a profitable venture for any of these companies. Virgin Galactic, the only publicly traded company of the three, has had a particularly rocky year, initially riding on the momentum of a SPAC deal. But more recently beset by launch delays and major funders including Branson himself selling large quantities of their stock in the company. Space is really, really, really hard and it's an absolutely shay, but it's one that happens to be very true. It's just really hard to do. That's also the reason that you've seen the delays that, you know, Virgin had talked about flying years and years ago and it became such a crazy point that Richard Branson actually stopped talking about it when he was asked because it was never going to be when he predicted. But it's not insurmountable and you know, investors have stepped up because this is something that is doable. Despite the astronomical dangers and costs of getting to space, it may ultimately follow the course of other once fanciful modes of travel. Right, brothers, having, you know, what was by modern standards, a very unimpressive first flight, you know, at Kitty Hawk, I mean, you know, you had like less than 20 years later, you had your first airborne ambulances being used to save lives. Fundamentally, the world is a more interesting place when people can go and dance among the stars and such. The lure of space is in a, it's in our DNA, it's that exploration bug. We are an exploratory species and we want to go out there and see what's out there. The vision that I had in 1969 of seeing normal human beings travel into space, it's finally beginning to happen. When you get a bunch of people up there and make it all see it for themselves, that'll create even yet another revolution in how we treat our planet and what we think about it. So while 2001 came and went without quite looking like Stanley Kubrick's ultimate space fantasy, 2021 might finally be the year we're catching up. If you visit California, you might be inclined to go to Disneyland or jump in your convertible and take Highway 1 up the coast.

We have so much National Forest in public land that you can literally just cruise out and find a place to camp. It's ours. What I wish was mine is Yann's sweet truck. It's a 2019 Ford Ranger. It has about 200 watts of solar in it and a fridge. And has everything that an RV has except for a toilet. But just on a smaller, simple scale. You drive us around day to day in LA. And then just roll out when you want. It's my daily driver. Handles great. And then when I'm done with work, I can just bail and go camping. So the camper basically has only what I need. Think of it as backpacking with a car. The fridge has a couple compartments. This is just a kitchen box. Stove, utensils, and a bunch of stuff. This one has just dry food.

After we split up from Jan and continued on our way, smoke started to envelop us. The plus side was that our RV no longer smelled like feet. The downside was breathing. My man David here suggested that we try and outflank the smoke by cutting through your semity. Without a reservation, we had to talk our way in. No stopping, no getting out. No problem. We just wanted to get through. It was a beautiful choice. We got out of the smoke. But not quite as effective as we had hoped. Fast forward four hours or so and we had managed to trade the smokey majesty of your semity. For the smokey... Look at it....strip malls of the Central Valley. We have made it sort of out of the smoke all the way across your Semity National Park. And here to the gorgeous Central Valley of California. We're off to see a kind of surprising tech startup that is making some pretty strange machines. To serve all the growers out in this region. And where we're going to wear here in this near...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,352,2022-11-17 23:26:58
17739," And where is the where here in this near Fresno? This is California Farm Country, right? We're just out the Fresno town called Kingsburg, so we're right in the central valley of California, very, very large farming valley here. It's kind of considered the bread basket of the world. The central valley stretches out over about 20,000 square miles, and the farmers here produce about one-fourth of the food that Americans eat, including a whole lot of fruits and nuts. Tell me a little bit of the background of God's. I know some of this is like a family business. The roots of this go back a ways. Tell me kind of like how we got, so what's essentially like a startup I guess. Yeah, definitely. The founder of our company is Dave Crinklaw, and he started the business back in 1982. He started with his, basically, with his dad, was commercial spraying of trees and vineyards. Got to the point where our biggest challenge was labor, just the shortage of it, really. He was forced into innovating, and he had had this idea for quite some time about doing a driverless sprayer, and it finally got to the point where he said, you know what, I either got to get out of this business, or I'm going to innovate. Organic or not, crops need to be sprayed, and this process has to take place a few times a year. This means hiring a lot of people to work long hours under serious pressure. And so, just like the tech bros to the north, Gus decided to solve all of its problems with robots. And there's like labor points, you guys have set this up where you can have somebody in a truck, and that one person can monitor, I think, like, eight of these. In order to operate Gus, you have one guy or girl that sits in a pickup, and they monitor from a laptop computer. So that person is basically just watching all the vehicles on the screen. They can monitor up to eight of them at a time while they're out there spraying in the orchard. So that user interface really provides them with all the information they need to make sure that the machines are safe and that they're doing the correct job. So it tells them what speed they're driving, the engine RPM, the amount of gallonage per acre that they're applying at any given time. So if any one of the machines has an issue, it's going to send an alert to that laptop. Much like a self-driving car, these beasts use GPS, LiDAR, and cameras to see and navigate the world around them. They also rely on pre-built maps of the orchards for extra guidance. Gus builds the machines right here and then takes them out for robot training on this orchard next door. It's here that the company learns if the machines will behave and do as their software and human masters command. So this is kind of like the test orchard where you guys put it through the pace and work on the technology. Yeah, so this is our test orchard right here. It's right by our building, so you can see in the background. So every new machine as it comes off the assembly line, it's put through a commissioning test. Right here, we test all the sensors on the machine, autonomous computer, all the safety systems, make sure it's doing what it's doing, prior to when it's delivered to a customer. So what's it doing now? So right now he's doing a test spray. So he's just turning the water on to make sure that the system comes up to pressure, spraying water out of the nozzle. It's just to make sure it's all functioning properly. Okay. He's got like a crazy turbine at the backer. Yeah, so it's basically just a big fan. Okay. And that fan's driven off of the Cummins diesel motor and it just basically creates a big air flow. Gus is already selling these vehicles to brave modern farmers. And people the world over have taken notice of its machines. And if you just sold them in the Central Valley or like throughout the US or even overseas or where they go. Yeah, so right now the majority of our machines are here in California in the Central Valley. However we do have machines and customers in Florida and the citrus industry over there as well as Australia. And I think you start selling them.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,353,2022-11-17 23:31:25
17740," California in the Central Valley. However, we do have machines and customers in Florida and the citrus industry over there as well as Australia. I think you start selling them in like December of 2019. Yeah, so we started taking orders early last year for the sprayers and the first delivery we made were in December of 2019. Okay. And how much do they cost each? So our retail price on these machines is $285,000. This is like, it's not a small investment, but I'm sure the regular sprayers aren't. Yeah, I mean, we're honestly not too far away from conventional equipment on our price. And the main thing is that the return on investment is very, very quick due to all the labor savings and the increased efficiency. I mean, these machines, they just, they just drive. But basically what we're doing besides this machine, this is our first machine we call it orchard gas. Mainly designed for your, your nut trees as well as citrus and fruit in the future. We're working on a few other projects. We're going to do more machines. One of them is actually a vineyard sprayer. So vineyards are much tighter spacing. So the machine has to be physically smaller. And then we've got our eyes on doing a lot of other innovating. That right there, friends, is a central valley farmer putting his whole fruit basket on the table. Gary's TED Talk can't be far off. And with that, it was time to get back in the RV. And to confront what happens when three men are bested by their own failings. And the forces of entropy. Next on Hello World, we cruise into the Mojave Desert in search of a lunar lander. We have instruments that we are going to deliver to the South Pole of the Moon in December 2022. Instruments that are trying to scan the surface of the Moon. And hang with a test pilot who walked away from this. Meet Betty. She lives by herself. But for the last few months, she hasn't been alone. Ella Kew, tell me a joke. Did you hear about the claustrophobic castor knot? No. Apparently, he just needed a little space. Most technology isn't made for 93-year-olds. But this woman is making sure that this particular robot is. Ella Kew, who are you? She's researching the way we interact with machines. And if she has her way, robots will soon be a trusty companion for all of us. My name is Ella Kew. How can I help you? A technology replaces old jobs. It's also creating new ones. I'm Aki Ito, and I'm here to show you the jobs of the future. My name is Danielle Ishak, and I am a human robot interaction researcher. It's really hard to intuitively design a robot meant for a consumer audience. You have to make sure that it's a robot that people want. People know how to use. And people value. Danielle works for an Israeli startup called Intuition Robotics.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,354,2022-11-17 23:35:39
17741," News and people value. Danielle works for an Israeli startup called Intuition Robotics. Its US office is here in downtown San Francisco. Hello. Hey Danielle, it's Aki. The company is funded by a couple big names like Samsung and Toyota. Full disclosure, Bloomberg's venture capital arm is an investor too. These features might remind you of the Amazon Echo, but you'd be missing the point if you compared her to a smart speaker. She's not meant to just be useful. She's meant to be a companion. And that's why she has a head that cannot make other subtle gestures you might expect from a pet. Through our research with older adults, we're finding that almost on a daily basis, we see that somebody tells her that they love her or that they like her or that they miss her. Literally, I love you. They'll also tell her I'm depressed or I'm lonely. They'll open up to her in a way that they might not necessarily open up to a human because they don't feel like they'll be judged. L.E.Q. is an on sale yet, but a prototype is already in the homes of about a dozen early testers who live in the Bay Area. L.E.Q. Tell me what the weather is today. Danielle's job is to figure out what's working and what's not. Sorry, please rephrase your request. And she does that by visiting each of her testers twice a month. They're critical. We're building a product for people who we are not. I'm not a senior and how could you know how to design for somebody if you don't do research? Otherwise, you would just be designing in the dark. Jobs like Danielle's are just starting to emerge. Until recently, robots were mostly in factories separated from humans. But now, they're finally getting cheap enough, small enough, and smart enough to be in our homes. This has created a whole new challenge of designing robots that people will actually want to interact with. And that's where Danielle comes in. Her research has helped shape every little facet of L.E.Q. From the way L.E.Q moves to the way she talks. It's a very special job and it could be really hard and it could be really frustrating about that end of the day. It's incredibly rewarding. And I think the most rewarding part about it is when I see the joy on the user's faces, like that they saw their feedback turned into something real. Today, we've driven east of San Francisco to go see one of Danielle's research participants. L.E.Q. Tell me something interesting. Did you know that Ronald Reagan was a lifeguard in high school and saved 77 people's lives? Now, see, this is where a conversation is. She should open up and I should say, no, I did not know that. I expect her to be able to continue a conversation for at least a couple of comments. Yeah. And why is that? Why? Because that's companionship. When Betty was around Danielle's age, she was working with some of history's very first computers. When I was finishing up my master's degree, I was working at Harvard in the computer lab when they were building Mark IV.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,355,2022-11-17 23:39:58
17742," When I was finishing up my master's degree, I was working at Harvard in the computer lab when they were building Mark IV. A large room size computer, but now this artificial intelligence stuff is amazing. L.A.Q. Yes. Schedule, uh, doctor's appointment. No problem. I'm working on it. When Danielle brought along the idea of working with robotics for the elderly, I said, are you kidding me? Will older people connect to a robot? And she said, I don't know. Let's research and find out. Danielle grew up here in this suburb of Atlanta. Her parents spent much of their childhoods in Israel and met in the US. We as immigrants, we understood that we might need to work a little harder. In fact, I feel that rather than taking away from Danielle, it gave her so much more. Because she understood the fact that you need to run after your dreams and work really hard, no matter what the challenges are. School didn't come easily for Danielle. I have dyslexia and that very much affected my self-esteem academically. The principal of the school did not recommend her to take the entrance classes. She fought for it and she got into it and she did very well with them too. Danielle's first job out of grad school was at X. The secretive research facility founded by Google. It's known for dreaming up all kinds of wacky, far-flung ideas. Can you tell us about the moonshirt she worked on? No, I can't tell you too much about the projects that I worked on. I can't say that I was working on robotics. She loved the job, but wanted to work on something that would reach real consumers sooner. So she left X after a year and joined intuition robotics. She's been working in the field for four years now and it took her a while to find her footing in a male-dominated industry. I've gone to different meetups where we'll be like circle of men with their like zip-up jacket with their like company logo on it and a beer in their hand. And I'll come in with lipstick and nobody wants to talk to me. This is my closet. So at first she did her best to fit in, wearing a pair of glasses she didn't need and toning down her style. So what's the kind of thing you used to wear to a conference? Stuff like this, blousey things. That make you look like you're 40. But that got old after a while. And what's the kind of thing you wear now? It's like I just enjoy being kind of expressive and playful and what I wear. Before we wrap up for the day, Danielle has one more LEQ tester to visit. Joseph is 97 and he's had the robot in his home for eight months. How are you? I'm fine. How are you? Good. How has Miss LEQ been? She always tells me to take a drink of water at least four times a day. So we added a whole bunch of new facts to LEQ. Would you know that a cup of chopped red bell pepper contains more vitamin C than an orange? Okay. What did you think of that? Certainly the print was, I could see that quite clearly. What about this? Well, I could see that. What does LEQ?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,356,2022-11-17 23:44:27
17743," Hello. L.A.Q. Play music. No problem. It will begin shortly. By 2050, almost half a billion people are going to be 80 or older. And if current trends continue, more and more are going to be like Joseph and Betty, living alone. L.A.Q. Stop. Today, both of them are doing okay. But some of Danielle's other participants have been struggling. It's a kind of hard to leave them at the end of the day. It is. Some of our testers are pretty advanced in the stages of depression through loneliness and isolation. And at times, I know that L.A.Q. is cheering them up in their day. But I know that it's only part of the way. No source of artificial intelligence robots will ever be able to replace humans and human companionship or human care. The key to Danielle's work is to embrace that very limitation of machines. Robots should help humans do what they love, help humans interact with more humans, help humans in general. Not pull humans away from humans, not take humans jobs, leave humans about purpose. Whether it's in our workplaces or in our homes, robots are soon going to be everywhere. And it's up to Danielle to make sure this robot-filled future leaves us just a little better off. So don't be afraid. And if you are afraid, come and join us. Because I promise it's a friendly place. If you're like the estimated 74% of adults in the US who use YouTube, this might be a lot of fun. people on the planet. YouTube has created a revolution, not an evolution, in the way kids and families consume video content, and that extends then into how they view toys and play and all of the associated things that go with that. YouTube for the unaware can be adorable. It can be boring. It can also just be flat-out strange, but often it involves toys and for toy makers who embrace the platform it led to.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,357,2022-11-17 23:48:48
17744," Here I am, here I am, how do you do it? But often it involves toys. And for toy makers who embrace the platform, it led to record success. And I think it will surprise Uncle Syribe the biggest phenomenon that has ever happened in toy industry. This is the story of how YouTube changed kids' toys. Play patterns, the way children play is timeless. But how we deliver on those play patterns through product and how we market that to children has changed quite a bit over the years. And I would say that the last five to 10 years really ranks right up there with the 1950s when TV commercials directed to children was first launched by Mattel. This is Nancy's Wears. She led the Barbie brand during the 90s and spent four years as the chief marketing officer for Spinmaster. It used to be that there would be a few play things that parents would bring into the home where that children would create themselves like a stick and a ball becomes a play thing. And the industry was at a certain level of volume at that point. Mattel was very innovative and actually put the first product on TV and advertised it to children. Let's play how? This created a huge explosion in the toy industry that unfolded across decades. The hit of the day when you're ready to play, everyone knows this thing. Here he comes, here he comes. Great as tall you ever been. And his name is Mr. Machine. Here I go, here I go. I'm in man for that to go on the land of the city in the air. When you go back to the 1980s, what do you think of in terms of hit shows? You think of things like masters of the universe. You think of the original Transformers and Care Bears. The joke was they were 22-minute commercials. Just close your eyes and care. Let's make a TV show which is really a promotion for our property or IP to help sell toys. There were a lot of those famous characters in which kids absolutely loved it. They were totally entertained, but there were huge toy lines behind them. This is Jim Silver, a 37-year veteran of the toys industry. In 1999, he started a consumer toy review magazine called Toy Wishes. And now he's the CEO of an influencer talent management group, TTPM. Regulations changed through the years. And also, parents became aware that they were purely commercials. And you saw a lot of the new channels, the Disney Channel and Nickelodeon. They realized that wouldn't work anymore. And to them, entertainment came before licensing. What happened over time was that Toy started to become designed for a 32nd commercial. Closed at some mild amount of toolbox, open at some micro-machine, USA. Cruiser mini-micro-machine vehicles planes opposed to the police station, the marine of the mini-modercik, repair shop, the gas station, the construction office, work the rear working driver, highway, passenger, rapid garage doors. So if you couldn't explain it in a 32nd commercial, cost-reduced it out of the product, and just stick with what you could say. And features of toys, magical features using electronics, lights and sounds, and mechanical movements that magic, like they don't know how it happens, that became more and more important. The sound of power is heard. Oh my God, who's that man? See ya, that man. That man's turbo-powered, that mobile flies into high gear. Since 2000, with cable channels dedicated to kids, Disney Channel, Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network, there became the opportunity to reach kids in mass numbers every day of the week. And so the toy industry's continued to grow. The toy industry, for the most part, was a pretty solid business. Just growing a couple percent a year here and there. There'd be big, big years here and there when there's maybe a hit movie, like a Star Wars movie come out, you know, drive a lot of toy sales. From 2014 to 2019, the global toy industry would grow by 15%. At about the same time, those major cable networks of Nickelodeon, Disney Channel, and Cartoon Network.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,358,2022-11-17 23:53:08
17745," The global toy industry would grow by 15%. At about the same time, those major cable networks of Nickelodeon, Disney Channel, and Cartoon Network would lose half their total audience. 2017 also saw the bankruptcy of Toys R Us, as both parents and kids discovered and bought more toys online. If you think about kids, they're usually the first adopters of a new medium. Kids weren't watching things like Nickelodeon as much as they used to. They were watching things on YouTube. YouTube started in early 2005, and this was like, you know, the very early web 2.0, this beginning of sort of like what was the time, was going to be your generated content. Web blogging was really big. My space was the biggest thing on the internet back then. There was an early video of a Brazilian soccer legend doing stunt tricks that just when I exploded on the site when the first viral video was lazy Sunday if you remember that SNL short. That's the chronic life of Killson Audio! Oh, Charlie! I'm going to be a bit bad. You remember those early viral hits? YouTube in the early days was definitely comedy and music. It was a place of experimentation. I was the chief audience officer at Maker Studios. The creator partnerships and all over the world. Maker Studios was one of the largest multi-channel networks on YouTube and had partnered with some of the biggest YouTube channels of the time before being sold to Disney in 2014. Chris is now the CEO of Pocketwatch, which represents some of the largest kids stars on YouTube, including Ryan's world, and Love Diana, who can amass over a couple billion views every month. This is one of the very biggest and earliest videos on all of YouTube. It was by a creator and star named I Justine, where she unboxed her first mobile phone bill for her brand new iPhone, and it came in a box. And this ultimately morphed into many different formats associated with unboxing and tech was actually really big. And those became fairly successful pretty early on on the platform. And you saw them expand from tech products to beauty products and then around 2012 and 2013, which only just exploded into toys. So here's the Furby inside right here. We used to call them handschannel. And a handschannel was literally a top-down view of someone's hands unboxing typically a toy. And they'd unbox it, they'd show each component. We just got Uncle Scream. I would speak to many of those creators. We signed many of those creators at Maker Studios to be our partners. And it was fascinating in that it was this whole new genre and this whole new format. And that corresponded with a rise of kids and family viewership on YouTube that was stark, that was hard to miss. And you would see it in the data. And we had access to a lot of data in Maker Studios around YouTube. Let's see what's inside. First up, we have the Storm Super Pig. You saw the launch of EvanTube, who I consider the first child to speak unboxing star. And they would open toys and kids would just mesmerize by it. They loved watching it. And next thing you know, you had literally 50 unboxings. They were unboxed just about every toy. And people were just really excited. You open the toy and you see a toy pop out and kids just got excited, see the piece by piece. Yeah, he's in a bathroom. We're in a, he's eating a lobster. You know, the early days of these unboxing videos, the videos were, you know, from adults perspective just terrible. I mean, they were 10 minutes long. They were boring. They were a shaky camera. There was absolutely no production value. And if you think about these executives, you know, they're trying to figure out how to reach this new audience. And they're brought these videos and say, well, look at this video. It has 200,000 views on it. And it's terrible. When I first heard of it, I thought it was the weirdest thing. It just seemed kind of bizarre.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,359,2022-11-17 23:57:31
