18402," You know, I'm an optimist and I know it's not the most fashionable thing, but that's why I'm sitting here with you today. Bye. Edward, thank you so much for your time today. Thank you! You're one of the most fascinating entrepreneurs because you all started with the young. What did you learn? Did you always think that you'd be an entrepreneur? Probably, yes. I think, which is a bit sad. From age what? Five? I'm not sure. I come from a family of entrepreneurs, so even I probably can spell the word and still can't take it. It's sort of in my blood, but it's, it's, it's really fun starting a business. It's fun growing a business. I feel it's a real privilege. And I started my business officially at 18, but I think I knew I wanted to do it very differently from about 15. But I'm sure it's, you know, if you're surrounded by it, it feels very natural. So, yes, it's fun. And it started how you started by making, you want Florence. It was an Italy and you started handbags. Yeah, so I knew I was actually given a handbag by my mother when I was about 61 or for all time bags. And I remember how it made me feel. And I think fashion is fascinating for the mood changing, the confidence boosting aspects, the tribal aspects of what fashion does. And so I went at 18 to Florence knowing that was the home of, of, of Leatherguss, which is what interested me. I just wanted to learn actually, I'm being surrounded by craftsmen who are making paintings as important. And that's going to be very interesting, I think, over the next sort of 10 years, I think the on-shoring of craft and manufacturing is going to be fascinating. Actually, I mean, I watched the off-shoring and literally saw it. And I think we're going to be seeing that coming back to local. We have to. When we're all looking at objectives in terms of carbon, you know, proximity is going to be key. So what's the best investment advice you've ever been given by anybody? The compound interest, the compounding of returns is an incredible miracle of business, finance, and human existence. Everything you learn is additive every day. And if you keep at it and don't quit, it's an incredible miracle. And it's, and it's not just interest. It was, it was always said about compound interest returns, compound business returns, compound human returns. They're all very additive because you'll learn every day. And if you keep at it, it's very, very helpful. In your observation of investors, what do you think is the biggest mistake that average investors make? Selling at the wrong time. And they sell when the prices go down? Yes. Or, yes. Not keeping, but people have conviction or they invest for the, if they invest for the right reasons, just keep at it. There are the vanguard of a green transition. They're delivering locally in a time of global energy turmoil. Utility companies are having their moment in the sun. Energy is on every once in a while. Around the world. Energy independence. Energy prices. Energy availability. Utilities historically have been viewed as stodgy, slow moving, boring. boring companies. I would not be here if it were anything like that. The utilities that are going to thrive in this environment are the ones who have a diversified energy mix, particularly the ones who have a higher percent of clean energy resources that is reliable, such as nuclear, as well as wind and solar and gas in the mix to back those up. Duke Energy, providing regulated gas and electric services to about 10 million customers in seven US states, has flourished in the spotlight. Revenue's have rebounded since COVID rocked the industry in 2020. The volatility that's driven profits has also created pressures. We're in a period of inflation. We're in a period where commodity prices are high. So every season of leadership is going to have some particular challenge. And Duke will meet these challenges with fresh leadership. After almost a decade at the helm of finance, Steve Young decided to step away from the role. In September 2022, company veteran Brian Savoy became CFO. Why now retire from your position as CFO? I thought it was time. It made a lot of sense. Brian is ready. Succession planning is something that is ongoing at Duke Energy. And this gave us an opportunity to permit Brian, someone who has great financial background, good market and economic background, who also has led businesses, so understands P&L. And so.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1016,2022-11-20 00:03:13
18403," You need to promote Brian, someone who has great financial background, good market and economic background, who also has lead businesses, so understands P&L. And so it just felt like the right time to begin that transition. The transition in the C-suite comes as duken barks on a transformation of its business. Aiming to retire all coal by 2035, achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and reshape its portfolio around natural gas, nuclear power and renewables. We're basically rebuilding generation and transmission and distribution to meet the needs of the future. We're going to invest $145 billion over a decade. That is a staggering amount of money, which means it's a staggering amount of things we've got to go buy, replace, install, make work and do it in an affordable way for our customers. That's a tall order. It's a team effort. So Void will have plenty of support from Young, who's now Duke's Chief Commercial Officer and Lynn Good, who was once Duke's CFO herself. Any advice you want to give them from your CFO hat? C-E-O-Hat, you can't give advice. The CFO hat. The advice I gave him was jump in with all force and make this job as big as you can, because you sit at the nexus of so many things in the Chief Financial Officer role. The business, the regulation, the finance, delivering value to investors and to customers, and I think Brian is very capable of doing that. It's an amazing time to be in this role in this moment. Stressful? Extremely. And daunting. There's a lot going on, but I wouldn't have it any other way. Here's what Duke's power generation mix looked like in 2021, with coal and oil nearly a quarter of the portfolio. Here's how it should look by 2030, renewables were more than triple as a share of the company's power output. We have been putting pieces in place in our regulated business for several years to really accelerate this clean energy transition. Renewables bring price stability, because there's no fuel. I see there's a sun shine or the wind. There's typically a significant capital of front investment, but it's predictable. Natural gas is needed to balance the grid and the reliability needs, because the wind doesn't blow all the time, the sun doesn't shine all the time. The batteries can't bridge the gap enough, right? So our plan is to reduce natural gas over time, but use it as a bridge fuel as we proliferate renewables, and nuclear has been just a tremendous benefit for our customers. And we see promise in future nuclear in the 2030s as we move to the transition. That's not the only transition Brian's support will manage. Duke wants to focus its time, money, and resources on its regulated businesses. It's looking for a buyer for its commercial renewable energy holdings. Our commercial business is one that I ran, so I'm very familiar with, and it served us very well. But it is only 5% of our company, right? And our regulated business has a clear path to growth and the competition for capital's fierce inside our company. And there are a lot of interest. There's a lot of money to invest in green energy. They are performing a strategic review right now of this business, and I think it makes sense to do so, right? Because in the utility space to really get credit in evaluation for a non-regulated business, such as renewable generation, right? You have to do it at a much larger scale. And it does make sense to take a closer look at maybe somebody else's a better stir of capital here in recycled capital to redirect that into the regulated business. Duke forecast earnings growth of 5% to 7% through 2026 driven by a lot of capital investment. The company intends to spend a whopping $145 billion in the next decade, with the lion share going to changing its energy mix and modernizing its grid. Brian Savoy is in charge of deploying this capital under highly challenging conditions, including the highest inflation and most volatile energy prices in decades. When you get a surprise like high fuel prices, we need to adjust things like O&M, and so we work with operations and the relationships I have throughout the company.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1017,2022-11-20 00:07:29
18404," This is we need to adjust things like O&M and so work with operations and the relationships I have throughout the company are positioning me well to help influence our operators to adjust their cost as we need to for customers. Do you feel that reducing costs right now while also increasing spending is different than in the past because of the inflationary pressures because of the energy transition? I would say yes, there are a lot of pressures on the business that we might have had in short spells in the past but it feels more systemic that we're going to see inflation for some time higher commodity prices. With the kind of volatility if someone comes to you and says hey Brian, so I need some more money for my division to do this. Are you like the no guy or are you able to be really nimble and make sure you can be the yes guy? I would say I'm the how can we. If we say yes to a request that was emergent we get to say notice some other things so how do we prioritize and make it all work. CEO and former CFO Lynn Good knows how hard this balancing act can be. I think anytime you're trying to balance you get pulled in various directions. There will be a pull to build more renewables by certain of our stakeholders. There will also be a pull not to go that fast because it could be too expensive. Maybe our industrial customers are worried about price. Full and liberal customers worried about price. So trying to strike that right balance with policy makers, with customers, with investors is a challenge at any moment and there will be a challenge in this one. Take me inside some of the conversation you guys are having a do right now. So you and Lynn and other C-suite executives sitting around on table, what do you guys talk about most right now? Supply chain has been a moving target of issues. Last year at this time we were looking at solar panels and how do we lock in our solar panels that we need for the next several years to ensure we can execute the clean energy transition. It has moved to different components like transformers which are essential for the grid. Interstrates and the pace at which the Fed is moving interest rates is something we talk about each and every week. And when will that flatten out and how will that impact our business? We are a very large debt issuer. So we watch this extremely closely because it affects our cost structure. Do you want to wait until interest rates level off and then is that delay your capital raising to deploy your plan? We don't wait but we do plan. There are opportunistic times to issue debt. We will go with larger pieces or versus smaller. And we can work with the length of the debt. And if 10 year is price more attractive than 20 or 30 we will use the tenor to optimize the interest rate. That's all I knew, yeah? Yes. Coming up, Ryan Savoy takes me to the room where it happens. An expert teen gathers data and makes decisions that keep juxtaprenuables running smoothly. They're looking for the smallest change in output because every megawatt hour is money. This is Bloomberg. Brian Savoy is taking on a new challenge as he steps into the CFO position at Duke Energy. It's really just his latest challenge. He's touched virtually every area of the company over the last two decades. I started my career at Duke in Houston and our trading business and I was with Deloitte too before I joined Duke as one of my clients. You know, what I saw in Brian was tremendous enthusiasm and energy. He was ready to take on new assignments. He was thinking about advancing the ball for the corporation as opposed to any personal goals. And that came through. He helped us on a number of complex projects. And the more we get.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1018,2022-11-20 00:11:48
18405," as opposed to any personal goals. And that came through. He helped us on a number of complex projects. And the more we gave him, the more he continued to grow. I've had five different roles in 10 years. And I've seen different parts of the company from, you know, transformation, leading natural gas and commercial strategy. This has prepared me for the role I have today. What's the advice that you've given him? You know, I've told him a couple of times that you're not going to get a home run at every at bat. There's going to be days where things go wrong. Be patient, be calm, keep your eye on the ball for the future, the thing you want to get to eventually. You'll have bumps in the road. Fixing things that go wrong and smoothing out bumps in the road is what customers expect from energy providers. And for Duke's renewable assets, that process is overseen from one room in an office building in Charlotte, North Carolina. Ryan Savoy showed me around the company's Renewable Control Center. This is where our operators are monitoring and managing over 5,000 megawatts of renewables across the United States. How would this differ from like a conventional asset monitoring center? Yeah, so assets historically, they would have the monitoring center on site. So you might have an operator with screens, but at the site, whereas this we can do 90 sites, if there's offshore wind, onshore wind, solar, and they're looking for the smallest change in output because every megawatt hour is money. You put an asset in, let's say it's 100 megawatts, right? You expect to get 100 megawatts each and every hour that the resource is there. The resource could be sunshine or it could be wind. And when you get 90 or 80, you're not producing what you can. And it can be because the asset isn't working properly. Maybe something hit the turbine blade on the wind farm. Maybe the solar panel has debris on it. Or it could be the solar intensity is not quite there. When one of these assets isn't producing full capacity, we're putting another resource on it. And we're having to toggle this on a consistent basis. And this as clouds come, this is by the minute. This is not, or the hour itself, no, it's by the minute and then it'll fall, come back and we have assets that follow this digitally as well so that we can keep a consistent flow of electrons on the grid. The operators in this room can respond to incoming data with immediate action, remotely controlling wind turbines, solar panels and batteries. It's another example of using digital and technology tools to make us more efficient, to make us more productive, minimizing the amount of people we have to have running around and observing and giving us the statistics to really be able to maintain and monitor those facilities. We couldn't see degradation and output as fast as we do now with the technology and the digitalization of the system. Now we still need technicians nearby. And so we use traveling crews that can go, say, sites in Kansas versus sites in South Texas versus Central Texas and across the West. We have around the clock shifts, but about 20 people rotate through these shifts. And again, recovering 90 sites, we get about half a dozen people here at any given time managing it. You could think that would scale at over time as renewables grow in the United States. So would you say that as you invest more in renewables, it's a hardware thing or a software thing? Like where do you think you're going to spend the most money doing that? Obviously, the software will continue to improve over time. And the sensors on the equipment are very important to, again, identify those degradation and output, but it's deploying the hardware. Getting the assets on the ground, getting the sites ready, connecting to the grid is a huge lift. Duke's hardware and software mix keeps evolving. And so does its workforce. Retooling also means retraining. We've moved people to the renewable space. Some of these folks used to be in coal. We've moved people to cybersecurity, which is a growing area that we need more and more. Because as everything gets digitized, there's more opportunities for bad actors to penetrate. So we need high cybersecurity skills, and when you match that with operating skills, you really have a beautiful mix that makes a strong, strong operator. These here have plenty of micro details to keep track of, but there's a macro factor.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1019,2022-11-20 00:16:14
18406," You really have a beautiful mix that makes it a strong, strong operator. Operators here have plenty of micro details to keep track of, but there's a macro factor on their minds as well. That's the weather. We have maps in the United States just to give the operators a bearing of what's going on in the country. And we have plotted on it where our renewable sites are, so they know if there's a weather pattern, weather system coming, I expect that in that area. How do you manage extreme weather? So let's say we have a wind farm in the west and a wind storm is coming. Yeah. You know, the assets will turn off when the wind speeds exceed a certain level automatically. Okay. Because there's risk of breakage of the blades and damage to people and assets and stuff. We know a wind storm is coming that might damage the solar or a hail storm, for instance, right? We can watch those assets closer. We can put a crew on site, but this team would be dispatching those crews onto the location. And that's where the weather map and the team really works. Yeah. From hurricanes in the southeast to wildfires in the west, extreme weather events are becoming more prevalent and more intense. Utility companies are bracing for greater risk. When we think about the impacts of extreme weather events on the grid, large grid connect and resources would still, such as large-scale solar farms and large-scale wind farms, would still rely on the centralized grid to deliver electricity to the load centers. So to the extent that the grid is knocked out by a hurricane, those assets would go offline as well. So in addition to investing in green generation resources, it's extremely important in companies pay attention to grid-hardening measures. We're seeing more of it, more frequency of severe events and how we predict those, monitor those and estimate the damage using data analytics and machine learning to say, how many customers might be out of this happens, what generators are at risk, and all that modeling goes into our planning for. What we put our investments, we talked about the capital plan earlier, all those investments are informed by the climate trends that we see across our system. Coming up, Duke's Clean Energy Plans get a major boost from DC with the Inflation Reduction Act. The void is already working through the possibilities. For example, 1000 megawatts of solar equates to about 60 million in annual production tax credits. This is Bloomberg. When US jobs numbers are released, Bloomberg brings you crucial data at terminal speed and instant expert analysis. Nobody covers jobs day like Bloomberg. Okay, so you're moving in on me quick, just trying to me with your fancy hands. I'm going to deal with your night because this is really bothering me. Ah, my night. Yeah, he's a troublemaker. Yeah. What did you get up to this weekend? You know, just robot stuff, a lot of chess. I was practicing for you. I know you're pretty good. Ooh, I don't like that. I will take this. Put it over here. Not cool. Not cool. All right. I will. I will concede. I can see. You've got me, Bid. Very good game. Well played. Thank you, sir. Thank you. You've got to explain this one to me. What does it mean when the White House says we're watching markets carefully? It means they have a Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. They have. I've been in and seen it. Lots of Bloomberg. Lots of Bloomberg. Lots of Bloomberg. Lots of Bloomberg. Lots of Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. What does it mean?

18407," through regulators. And modern recovery mechanisms allow us to adjust price more frequently and align with our investments. So that when the investments start causing expenses, revenues follow. And there's alignment. Otherwise, we call it regulatory lag where you have expenses before we can earn revenues on those assets. Historically, we would build up investments, then have what's called a rate case and have a large increase in one one slug. The modern recovery mechanisms place assets in service each year essentially. So your smoothing rate increases over time. So customers can plan better and we can plan better. Even with meticulous planning and regulatory tailwinds, U.S. utilities must proceed with caution. Europe's energy crisis highlights the fight between green energy and energy security, raising questions about how fast and hard the world can pivot. There's been criticism saying Europe that they were trying to go too fast into renewables, for example. And therefore they left out nuclear and they sort of shuttered coal plants and now they're paying the price in that respect. What's the right pace? I think the pace is maintaining balance with a reliability and affordability. That's the only way we know to to gauge pace. We will not put a plan together, then we don't have a high degree of confidence. We can serve our customers every hour, every season. And we have to keep an eye on affordability. We call it a responsible balance transition. The transition away from fossil fuels is coming. I mean, just think about coal. Five years ago you could get as much coal as you want. Now coal's constraint and it's going to become even more constrained. So operating coal assets is not even going to be an option as we move through time. So the convergence of energy independence and security I believe is coming soon. That's the state of play for Brian Savoy as he starts his tenure as Duke's CFO. I asked him what he sees when he looks ahead. What is the biggest opportunity over the next 10 years as CFO that you're most excited about? Over the next decade, I feel like utilities have a moment to really make a mark on society. And again, it's long lasting. It's going to be for our grandkids and their grandkids. So putting the utility sector in prominence of the world, that's what I wanted to do. What's the biggest challenge? What are you most worried about in the next 10 years in doing your job? I think the biggest challenge is balancing investment. The investments we need to make and the transition in front of us with the cost to customers because the oversight of our regulators is only getting more and more and more. And we've got to be more clear on the customer benefits of every dollar we spend that turns into value for customers. And I can see this playing out in just hand-to-hand combat over the next decade. And we will work it. And we believe the investments we're making will will meet that that bar. What is the skill that you have as CFO that you think will help that? I'm wired for value. I don't like waste at all. And when I see things that we need to change, I have the courage to make it happen. And as CFO, I'm in a position to really move that in Duke. And what's a new skill set of knowledge that you're excited about over the next 10 years? I would say the new skill set would be how to balance all of the external views of the company with the internal. I've worked inside this company and have great influence. But ensuring that similar level of influence is out in the external world. What's the best advice you've received coming into CFO? You know, I will go back many years ago, over 10 years ago, I was working for Lynn. And she told me, Brian, the skills you have positioned you for a wide range of roles. I had no idea what that meant. Then this was like 2009. But as I've looked at my career, and she has moved me to gain experience across Duke in the right areas of operations and strategy, that advice back then, I didn't appreciate, but I appreciate it now more than ever. I'm Alex Steele. This is Bloomberg.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1021,2022-11-20 00:28:29
18408," Bloomberg. So what happens is that we create some icons and call them tags and they have a like a signal within them. And when you stare at that your eye responds to it in a particular way. The way in which that eye response occurs is a signal that we pick up on the visual cortex of the brain at the back of the brain. So the sensor is looking for the signals we create here that come through the eyeball, through the brain and then onto the visual cortex. Once we've got it there as a signal, we can grab that, we understand what that signal looks like and we can turn that into a command or whatever we're trying to control. There's multiple places where we think this technology could be applied, perhaps in driving or commanding, a man's ground vehicles or a man's naval vessels, perhaps providing a menu selection and control within a control room environment, maybe an innuid to be a power station, all those kinds of things are perhaps in the value of this technology. Imagine simply climbing a cable into space. The concept is known as the space elevator. Not only could it significantly change how we leave planet Earth, but it could also completely transform humanity's relationship with space. And there are scientists who think we could have already built it. We have the material, we have the technology, we have the lasers, we have the climbers, we have all of it. If a private entity wants to build it or a government, they can build it. It'll change society. We have no clue how colonizing in the space, how really spreading on the space, really changed our society over the next 50 to 200 years. It'll be completely different. The idea of the front and center, how does Japan get away with not raising rates? Can it sustain its normal at a time when everybody else is facing a very different way out? Bloomberg surveillance, be informed, be prepared, be ahead of the game. This is a market that over the past few weeks has made it clear it wants to go higher. It got a little spooked by the idea that geocolatal potential rises. Thank you Andy so much for coming down. It's really wonderful to have you here in person. It's my pleasure to be here. Thanks for having me. We actually lived in the same dorm in college just a few years apart. So it's been almost a year since you took over from Jeff as CEO of Amazon. It's been a year of first, the first Docs Blitz since the.com boom, the first vote to unionize an Amazon warehouse, your first Bloomberg technology conference. Thank you. I want to start with a quick report card. In February 2021, Jeff Bezos shocked the world by announcing plans to step down as Amazon CEO. A few months later, he passed the reins to Andy Jassy, his longtime top lieutenant, the architect of one of the company's biggest profit engines.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1022,2022-11-20 00:32:35
18409," Step down as Amazon CEO. A few months later, he passed the reins to Andy Jassy, his longtime top lieutenant, the architect of one of the company's biggest profit engines, Amazon Web Services. Maisos has stayed on as executive chair, leaving Jassy to navigate a critical inflection point in Amazon's history. How does the company manage market turmoil, rising inflation and regulatory scrutiny, and a push by some warehouse workers to unionize all while keeping customers coming back? Joining me on this edition of Bloomberg Studio 1.0, Amazon's second CEO, Andy Jassy, he joined us from our flagship Bloomberg Technology Summit in San Francisco. I'd like you to grade your view of Amazon's performance, and we've got time later to really dig in. But quickly, how would you grade Amazon's performance over the last year with customers? Well, I think I'm not sure I'm the right person to grade myself during the year or not, but I'll give you my take. I think with respect to customers, I think we've done a lot of good. And I think if you look at during the pandemic, which really has extended till the early part of this year, so much as the PPE and food and essential items and people equipping their home offices were bought from Amazon, and to scale the way we needed to remember, in 2020, we grew 39% year over year on a $245 billion revenue run rate. I mean, it's unprecedented. It's never happened before, but it was really hard to do that. And we had to take the really big footprint of the film at Center footprint. We built the first 25 years of Amazon and doubled it in 24 months. We built out that transportation network in just a couple of years. We nearly doubled the size of our workforce during that time. And I think you saw it in other businesses. AWS is a really big part of helping companies and governments have business continuity during the pandemic. And so many companies and organizations in the last year made the strategic decision that they were going to stop running their own infrastructure technology. And disproportionately chose AWS to help them move to the cloud. And we've spent a lot of time helping them make that transformation. So what about investors? I mean, the stock is down significantly from a peak last year. Obviously, there's broader market turmoil. Yeah, I think, you know, for investors financially, I'd say it's mixed. You know, I think we have some businesses that are growing really strongly. If you look at AWS in 2021, grew 37% year over year. It's not a $74 billion revenue run rate business. It's pretty unusual growth. And we grew 58% year over year in our advertising business. You know, what's the $32 billion revenue run rate business? So some businesses growing really strongly. And, you know, we've continued to grow in our retail business despite pretty crazy comparable during 2020. But I think the real challenge for us there is on the cost side. And there have been several things that have happened. Some of which are more controllable than others. You know, I think the part that's less controllable is really around inflation. And I think we thought that inflation would start to attenuate in 2022. And with the war in Ukraine, it just went the other way and has significantly accelerated. And so the cost of trucking and line haul and ocean and air and fuel has just substantially gone up. And I think that will attenuate at some point. No one knows how long that'll take. I think the more controllable areas for us are really around fulfillment center capacity and productivity. It was taking about 24 months to build new fulfillment centers during the pandemic. And so we had to make decisions, you know, in mid 2020 and early 2021 on how much demand we were going to plant for. And so, you know, we end up with more capacity than we need right now. And there's a number of things that we're working on. We've stopped building on properties where we don't need it yet. And we've let a number of leases lapse. And not a small number, you know, of both those things. We've had a lot of occasions in our history where we've worked on productivity and made improvements. And we have a lot of clearly defined niches. And I'm confident we're going to get back to the right level of profitability. You are going to sub least 30 million square feet of space. Is there a mistake in the execution there because of the overbuilding? Again, because you have to make these decisions two years in advance. And again, if you put yourself back in 2020 where we were growing 39 percent year over year on a 245 billion dollar revenue run rate, it's very hard to know what's the right amount to build and you have to make a decision. And we made it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1023,2022-11-20 00:37:09
18410," 39% year over year on a $245 billion revenue run rate. It's very hard to know what's the right amount to build and you have to make a decision. And we made the decision to err on the side of our consumers and sellers. Now, how would you grade Amazon's performance with employees, your colleagues? There has been some high profile. Yeah, I think that when I started in this gig, we had just created a new leadership principle to strive to be Earth's best employer. And I think we spent a lot of time trying to think through what that really means is broad. And I think we've made a fair bit of progress, but it's still early, in my opinion. But I still think there are many areas that we can keep improving. And I think the first one I'd mention is safety. I think that in our fulfillment centers, that is the top priority. And when you get into the details and numbers and outside of all the spin of it all, we're about average there, but we're not trying to be average. We want to be the best in the industry and the best in the world at it. And that's a high priority and an area that I'm passionate about and the team is passionate about. And I think we have a lot of work we can do to make our employees everyday lives easier. And we've identified kind of a top 100 list of areas that we can be better at, that we're just metronomically stepping through. And so we've made a lot of progress, but we've a lot of work to you still. Elon Musk just came out saying he has a super bad feeling about the economy, Tesla laying off 10% of his staff. Jamie Dimon says he's preparing for an economic hurricane. The world bank just slashed its forecast for global growth. How do you feel about the economic climate? Well, I wasn't planning on giving any guidance to the government. Please. But, super bad or super super bad? I think there's some things that are related to Amazon that are useful to remember. I think the first piece is remember that 85% of the worldwide retail market segment share is offline. And if you believe that that equation is gonna flip at some point, which we do, I think it will flip over a long period of time. If you look at different downturns, should we have one at some point? And we've been through a few, obviously, in the 25 years that I've been at Amazon, customers change their habits. And so I also think there's, those two reasons, those two factors, give me some optimism that even if we have a downturn, that we have the potential to still grow. We have a roadmap that's probably three to five years long, and we're gonna continue to invent, we're gonna continue to be insurgent, and we have a lot of work to do to get to where we think we ultimately can get for customers. Now, when it comes to the stock, as I mentioned, it has fallen significantly. Do you think investors are missing something or has tech just been overvalued? And this also of course matters to employees who are significantly paid in stock? Well, you know, I look, I haven't been at Amazon for 25 years. I arrived at the company three weeks before we went public. I have never tried to predict what the stock's gonna do. In any time, I've tried to a little bit, I've been wrong. So, you know, I think it's a pretty hard to predict what's gonna be in any short period of time. I do really believe that Benjamin Graham, Maxon, that in the short term, the stock market tends to be a voting machine, and the long term, it tends to be a weighing machine. And I think if you, you know, we've been through a lot of points in 25 years of Amazon, where the macro factors are off and stocks are down, our stock is down, but you can't really control that. You know, we have a concept we talk about a lot of Amazon inputs and outputs. You know, and the ultimate output for a company is share price, you know, and then other big outputs are free cash flow or profit or revenue. You can't really manage the outputs. You have to manage at the input level, and that's where we spend all our time. And so if you do the right things for the business long term, things tend to work out. I think we've had very good returns for investors, and I expect that to be true again.

The tape is crucially important and I think we've moved from this attitude, from its indulgence, a waste of time, almost an illness that needs a cure. For something as universally important to human life as sleep, the history surrounding its necessity and utility have only just been recently uncovered. Some of our biggest discoveries were in the 1970s or 1980s and so it makes that a really exciting field because it seems as though we're uncovering new insights each and every day. Some scientists are going further to find out how sleep and what happens there can be harnessed to further expand our understanding. It's easy to memorize things that makes you smart if you can spit back a lot of facts. You want to be wise. If you really want wisdom, you've got to know when and how and why to use that information. And that's what you bring to use out while you're sleeping. What are the moon shots at Amazon that are capturing most of your time and attention? What is going to define the next era of Amazon? Is it Astro, the home road butter? Well, we have a unique way that we look at big new investments. I'm not sure it's right or wrong, it just happens to be our way. We ask ourselves when we're considering something for questions. If it's successful, can it be big and move the needle in Amazon? Is it being well served today? Do we have a differentiated approach? And do we have competence there? And if not, can we acquire quickly? If we like the answer to those questions, we'll go pursue it with a single threaded team that isn't distracted by the rest of the business. And sometimes that leads to innovation and investments that seem pretty obvious. Like, you know, when I got to that company, it was a book's only retailer. And then we expanded to music and video electronics and toys. It seems obvious to people. Other times, that process does not lead to investments that seem obvious to people. I mean, AWS was something that people externally and internally thought was a little bit nutty at the time. But just imagine what Amazon would be today without AWS. And I think that you see the same thing here. You know, there are so many significant investments from making that I'm excited about. I'm going to have to constrain myself to a few. But, you know, I'm really excited about what we're doing in the prime video space. I think we're clearly on the right track there and building a significant business. That's interesting because Netflix also just announced some layoffs. First subscriber loss in a decade. Disney cutting back on costs. Do you see Amazon strategy as fundamentally different from Netflix and Disney? And if so, how? Well, you know, we're very bullish on it. And remember, we, all the models are a little bit different. But for prime video, we have 200 million plus prime subscribers who are, you know, get that entertainment for free by being part of prime. And so we have a little bit different pricing model than some of the others. But I'm incredibly encouraged by what we have coming. If you look, I mean, we launched this show. Reacher earlier in the year was a huge hit. We, you know, we had the New Maisel season. We just launched the new Boys season, which is our new Missed Boys fan. I am a big boy. Because Amazon bought. It's very good. Of course, we have, what are the rings coming up in September? And Thursday and football. So I'm very bullish about it. We also, you know, we're excited about what we've done with MGM. You know, I think some of the assets there will go very well with the rest of what we're doing entertainment-wise. So if you look at Warner Brothers' discovery and Paramount and Stars and Global, they're building really significant subscription businesses. So I'm very bullish about that business. I'm optimistic that we have a chance to.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1025,2022-11-20 00:45:43
18412," in Paramount and Starrers and Global, they're building really significant subscription businesses. So I'm very bullish about that business. I'm optimistic that we have a chance to build a significant grocery business, which is early stages for us. I am excited about Kuiper, which is our low-earth orbit satellite that we're building. You gotta remember there are 300 to 400 million people in the world who have limited to no internet connectivity. I mean, just think about how different the world is when you don't have that type of connectivity. And so I think that's a really significant opportunity that has some AWS characteristics to it. I continue to be very optimistic about Alexa building the world's best personal assistant. We have a 200 million endpoints already that are using Alexa, we're clearly onto something there. And then our autonomous driving, ride hailing service and zoos that we're building here in Bay Area. I just think with the way auto consumption is evolving, I think that also is a chance to be a really significant business. Now I don't know if all of them are gonna be successful, but if any one of them becomes the fourth pillar for us on top of marketplace and prime and AWS, we're a completely different company. Just like we were when AWS became successful. So I think they're very worthwhile investments and bets and I'm optimistic about them. We didn't mention Astro obviously, though powered by Alexa. Alexa, yeah. But I mean, our home robot's gonna be doing it. We don't yet, where is it? It's not really widely available for sale. What's the status? I hope you get one. Okay. Thank you. Everyone's very curious about Jeff's role these days. What kind of executive chair he really is. He said when he left that he'd focus his attention and energies on initiatives that he really cares about as Ed Amazon, but from the outside, it looks like he's really focusing on philanthropy. He's focusing on space. What kind of an executive chairmen is he? Well, Jeff is always gonna be involved and he has, you know, I feel very lucky to have been in Amazon for 25 years. I feel very lucky to have worked directly for Jeff for 20 of them. And we have a really close relationship and have for a long time. And I think we share a lot of the same values about customers and how important it is to optimize for customers and how high standards they need to be, you know, given how easy it is for people to switch and the importance of invention and speed. And so I just feel very lucky to have had the chance to work so closely with him. So is your relationship, I mean, he was your only boss for 25 years, right? Is your relationship fundamentally different than it was when you were the head of innovation? Yeah, of course. Every single job you have, the relationship's different. You know, remember, the first couple years I worked for Jeff, I worked as what we call this shadow then, which is really like a chief of staff. And that was different than when I was starting AWS, which was different from when we got AWS going. And it was a business that was starting to do well. And it's different when I'm in the CEO role. But you know, the constant has always been that we have a great relationship and we collaborate really well. Amazon has poised to become the biggest private sector employer in the world. Second, right now Walmart is in that spot. But Amazon will probably soon surpass it. First vote to unionize at an Amazon warehouse. I know you've been spending a lot of time at warehouses. When you look at someone like Chris Smalls, who I think some people look at as this modern day hero who got fired, pulled off this union vote, what's your message to someone like him, your message to the folks who think, maybe we should join a union? Well, I know I think that the first thing to be clear about is that employees get to make that choice, whether they want to have a union or not. They always have had that choice and it continues to be their choice. And we happen to think they're better off without a union for a number of reasons, including the fact that, it's much harder when you have a union to have a direct relationship with your manager and to get things done quickly. So if you see something on the line that you think could be better for your team or you or customers, you can't just go to your manager and say, let's change this. There's a whole process in bureaucracy that you have to go through to be able to do that. And when there's a union, we're going to get the feedback filtered by what the union decides is worth bringing up. And we'd much rather hear from every employee whatever is on their mind. So you know,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1026,2022-11-20 00:50:10
18413," We're going to get the feedback filtered by what the union decides is worth bringing up. And we'd much rather hear from every employee whatever is on their mind. And so I think if you want to continue to have the structure that we've had for all this time, you have to have really competitive benefits. And then I think if you look at Amazon's, they're very unusual in this space. We championed the $15 minimum wage several years ago. The starting salary is now over $18 an hour, which is more than double the federal minimum wage. You get full health insurance and 401K and up to 20 weeks of parental leave. And if you want to get a college education, you haven't had one. We have a career choice program that lets our fulfillment center associate be able to do so. That is a very unusual and compelling set of benefits. And those were all accomplished without a union. So I think that we realize that we have to continue to work on the relationship with our employees. And we need to continue to provide the right benefits. And we need to continue to work on safety. And that's our intention. You made a huge mark on Amazon with AWS obviously. What is the mark that you want to make still? Access the financial world on demand.

Visit Bloomberg.com webinars. crypto, you have a world of young people that want their own financial system and their own culture. And it is very powerful. And I'm a big believer in it. The FTC has revamped its antitrust inquiry into Amazon. And by some accounts is accelerating it. Are you preparing for an antitrust lawsuit from the FTC? If you are a large company that's growing to a significant extent, like we have, you have to be prepared to be scrutinized. And we have known this for some time, many years. And we have tried to run the company with that in mind. And knowing that if somebody looked, that we would stand up to that scrutiny. And I think that's what we've tried to do in running the business. We can't control whether organizations spring different suits against us. But I think if you look at our business, if you actually look at the fact, if you take out of the equation that there may not be the most objective leadership when it comes to Amazon in that organization, if you look at the facts in our retail business, we're about 1% of the worldwide retail market segment share. And remember, 85% of us is still offline. And if you look in our AWS business, we, you know, about, depending on you measure it, 95% of the worldwide global IT spend is on premises. And then we have a cloud business, and then we have a portion of that. You know, we were leading market segment share in the cloud part of this, but we operate, you know, who we compete with, AWS is really on premises, IT, in addition to the cloud. So, you know, these are relatively small percentages of the entire pie, and you can kind of step through all the businesses. And I think simply because you've been successful in a few different businesses, doesn't somehow mean that you have a natural market power. It just means you've been successful on a couple of different customer experiences, but we still have a relatively small amount of market segment share in those areas.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1027,2022-11-20 00:54:17
18414," How mean that you have unnatural market power, it just means you've been successful on a couple different customer experiences, but we still have a relatively small amount of market segment share in those areas. What about the SEC, you're being sued by them over third party data and how you've used it? Do you think in the past Amazon made mistakes with letting employees internally see how those third party sellers were doing? We have pretty good control. I mean, we of course disagree with the premise of that, but I would say that we have very good controls with respect to the data that different employees sets are able to see. And by the way, I think that we can be better for sellers. I think that we can have better tools from the get started, we can have better tools from the manage what they're doing across their different Amazon units. I think we can communicate better. There's a whole bunch of things we can do better. And we agonize over every single email or communication we get from sellers, and we do very regularly robust surveying, and a lot more sellers are happy with Amazon than unhappy with Amazon. And I think if you look at what they're able to do as a business by virtue of selling on Amazon versus not, it completely changes what's possible. Sellers don't really long for e-commerce software. That exists in lots of places, and it's not very expensive. What they love about selling on Amazon is that they get access to our hundreds and millions of customers, and that completely changes what their prospects can be in terms of the businesses they're building. So we have a lot of work to do there. Like we do in a lot of other places, but I think we have a very strong partnership with sellers. What's the view of the supply chain right now, and how much pain there is going to continue to be and for how long? Well, I think that there's a lot of challenges in the supply chain still. I mean, it's gotten better than it was, but there are all sorts of challenges. Non-parasurable goods, electronics, chips are still a really significant issue for all sorts of businesses. We have worked really hard to open a lot more points of presence in ports and to increase our capacity and getting products in, but I think it's going to be something that companies battle with for some time. You made a huge mark on Amazon with AWS, obviously. What is the mark that you want to make still on Amazon? I mean, in this new role, what's going to define the Andy Jassy era? Well, I don't really think of it that way, Emily. I mean, I don't think it's really about any Andy Jassy era or any one person. And by the way, AWS was not about any one person. If you spend a time on AWS, that is an unbelievable team, not just an incredible leadership team, which it is, but just top to bottom. The number of inventors and people care about customers and operate something where it has to work almost like a doubt on it. It's always teams. And so I look at every single one of our businesses and take our retail business, our consumer business, which is the oldest for our businesses, 85% of it still lives offline. I think we have a lot of upside and a lot of growth. And I think as much invention as we've seen the last 25 years, the time I've been there, I think it's going to look small compared to the next 25 years. There is a lot for us to invent on behalf of customers. And so I'm excited to be part of the team that makes that happen. We are continuing to increase the amount that we give back to the communities in which we have big presence. And that really matters to me. I think we even responsibility to do that. And so it's a long journey that we're working on. But I'm excited to be part of it and I hope to part it for a long time. Well, thank you for joining us and telling us about the way the journey is going so far. Thank you very much. Thank you, Jeff. Thank you, and see you around. Thanks.

We've got the information and insight. A lot of these areas still have very, very good valuations. From businesses most influential and instrumental. It's knocking it out of the bullpen. And I was not a great time to be stuck with it. It's time for a pivot. We're talking about a significant hit to our state of the living. Bloomberg Wall Street Week live tonight with replays all weekend on Bloomberg Television and Radio. A lot of the satellites have propulsion systems. They can kind of move to get out of the way of each other or change their orbit a little bit. It's a service that you guys offer to help these companies know how to maneuver the machines. Yeah, we offer a collision avoidance service. It's a subscription service. We'll send you an alert up to seven days in advance if your satellite's going to come dangerously close to a piece of debris or another satellite. Companies have been doing that for decades moving satellites around, but it's sort of like a harder problem now. The risk of a collision is a lot higher now. Just because we've installed so much more hardware into space, you have a big collision that creates a cloud of debris. And now all the other satellites are flying through this whizzing mess of debris. As we add all of the new satellites into space, the risks of the collision, the likelihood of the collisions going up. Before the COVID pandemic upended the way the world does business, logistics was one of those industries that might have been taken for granted. That's not the case anymore. Due to all the turbulence over the last two years, customers are now realizing how important it is to have a reliable logistics partner on their side. Our people are doing a quite complex job. People think, oh, they just deliver passes somewhere. That's an easy thing. If you think about what our people are doing, it's quite complex. Businesses and consumers are suddenly thinking a lot more about how things they need reach places where they're needed. It's thrust the sector into the spotlight. Logistics and supply chain has become a household need. It's dramatically different than pre-pandemic. Yes, it's grown, whether that's in Martha Pound, revenue, profitability, investor interest.

18416," Mentum and set ambitious goals for service and performance. When you look at our footprint, you're the most international logistics company there is. We want to become more digital, and we want to be much more sustainable than we have been. DP DHL's revenue has soared since 2020, with full-year profit nearly doubling in 2021. CFO Melanie Christ is a key leader of the team that's delivered these results. And she views her role as much more than just a number cruncher. There are unfortunately these clichés that finance is boring, and it's kind of like been counting in the back office to be successful in finance. I mean, you have to have the financial expertise, right? But we also have to be credible business leaders in order to really impact the business and steer the direction. She is extremely smart and bright. You need somebody who is able to digest a lot of information that rapidly and can distinguish what is important and what is less important. And she has tremendous skill in that. And she's not afraid to call people out, to call out other members of the executive team if she feels that something isn't being. She does that in a very nice way, actually. She helps me tremendously in steering the company because she is highly regarded by my other colleagues in the senior team. And typically, if they have a problem, they share first with her before they come to me. When I think about the conversations I have with Frank, the shortest part is actually about the analysis and the facts. It's more the debate about, okay, on that basis, what are the options? What can we do? My role is essentially saying in three sentences, what is working well in this company? Where do we have challenges? And what should we do going forward? Deutsche Post DHL Group consists of five divisions. Express Germany's Post and Passel Service, Global Forwarding and Freight, Supply Chain, and E-commerce solutions. Each of these segments has seen revenue growth in the last four years, while the surge of e-commerce volume during the pandemic has had a direct impact on the trajectory. Have you seen e-commerce as a very structural and fundamental growth driver for us as a company? What we now saw under the pandemic was a structural acceleration. It took us forward to a point in terms of e-compensation, which we probably would have reached on the normal circumstances in three years' time. So it was a big step forward. DP DHL was well prepared to take this step. The company's strategic plan recognized e-commerce as a growing trend in the logistics landscape. But no one could have forecast the speed and breadth of the transformation. What we are now seeing that also under the pandemic, not only domestic e-commerce has taken a faster growth trajectories and anticipated, but also cross-border e-commerce. And we see that very clearly in our express network, but also in our e-comp solutions division. What are the other big structural shifts that you see on the horizon? Is it e-commerce B2B? Is it increased trade as globalisation restructures? What are the shifts that you're seeing? The board B2B e-commerce is still at a very early stage. So we believe that there will be a huge close opportunity there. And we also see that when we are talking to our customers now, I guess everybody has been now realized that being dependent on just one supplier in one province in one country is probably not a good idea. So they want to build more resilience into the supply chain. I think our international footprint, our global strengths, is really something we can leverage for the benefit of our customers. Another factor in the company's favour is its balance sheet. Since Melanie Christ became CFO, Cashflow has improved significantly. One of my priorities over the last years has been to really focus the whole organisation on better cash generation. It's not just a finance job. Making sure that ultimately revenue converts into EBIT and into Cash in the bank account is the responsibility of the whole organisation. She says, we can't be successful as a company. If we are not collecting the cash for our services, we have provided. And she has not missed one single opportunity to talk about that. So I think it's a bit...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1030,2022-11-20 01:07:23
18417," It's a company if we are not collecting the cash for our services we have provided. And she has not missed one single opportunity to talk about that. I think it's a very comfortable situation, particularly in the current environment, to have a strong balance sheet. I think in that respect, I'm very conservative and I'd rather have a bit more on the balance sheet and a bit more buffer. Spell out for us what the priorities are, the longer term priorities, in terms of putting some of that cash to use for you. The first priority here is organic growth. We clearly indicated also this our CAPEX budget, 12 billion for the next three years, that we will keep investing into organic growth. We are very focused on our regular dividend payment. And then, if there is something left, which is fortunately the case at the moment, we will think about inorganic opportunities and we will also think about other means to allow our shareholders to participate. That is why we are currently running a 2 billion euro share by VEC program. Inorganic opportunities include M&A, like the recent purchase of beverage shipper, Hila brand. But deploying cash is always subject to careful consideration. Does Melanie ever turn around and say no when you're pushing through or pushing for a particular package of spending? Yes, she does that quite often, you know, because she has... She is a person and that's great if you have a CEO who is risk a person because you need somebody. You know, the business is always too optimistic. Melanie might be something too pessimistic, but that's a very healthy discussion. And if we then jointly come to the same conclusion after a debate, then we are probably in the right spot. How often do you find yourself saying no to divisional heads? So when I was promoted into the CFO position, my team gave me a stamp with rejected. It sits on my desk. I think the fact that people know it sits there already has instilled quite a lot of discipline in the organization. So I think when I get a proposal, it has already gone through a number of iterations and is normally of such a high quality that I don't need the rejected stamp too often. For the time being, Christ should be able to keep that stamp in a drawer. CEO Frank Appell has expressed a commitment to service quality and confidence that customers will accept higher prices that come with it. If you are too expensive, you will be out of business, but if you don't provide the right quality, you will be out of business as well. So we want to be, we will never be the cheapest in town that's not doable, we are the premium provider, that's our strategy. Of course, it's also more challenging for us when our customers are under pressure. At the same time, I think, over all the last two years have shown that reliable high quality supply chain comes at a certain price tag. I definitely see that inflation is having a huge impact on the logistics industry. And there's been substantial price increases in the last few years. I do not see that changing. There's a lot of innovation happening. And I don't see the inflation necessarily going away. It might level out a bit, but it's not going to go away. The logistics companies may have pricing power with customers, but their stock prices haven't been so robust. I think the issue there is the increase in interest rates has made everyone rethink and be concerned about the level of inventory that is out, you know, in the system, if you will, and with the level of disruption. I think what's happened more in the last. The premiums is the more of a view that we're actually heading into. Certainly any economic slowdown may be a recession. With more than half its revenue coming from Europe, investors may see DBDHL as more exposed to recession risks than its global peers. The company insists it can meet its revenue targets in the event of a downturn. It's counting on diversification as a cushion. I'm not so pessimistic that there is really a deep recession at our doorstep. But even then, our portfolio is very much balanced. We are everywhere in the world, but not going entirely in recession. Would it be a stretch to suggest that D.P.?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1031,2022-11-20 01:11:44
18418," Then, our portfolio is very much balanced. You know, we are everywhere in the world. The world will not go entirely in recession. I doubt that. Would it be a stretch to suggest that D.P. DHL is, to some extent, recession-proof? I wouldn't go as far as to say recession-proof, but I think we are very well positioned to deal with all different types of recession scenarios due to the breadth of support for you. The balance of support for you really gives us a lot of resilience against any type of headwind. Coming up, a look at D.P. DHL's investments in action.

As the chief financial officer of one of the world's largest logistics companies, Melanie Christ has made her mark in global business. That's not what she originally attempted to do. I really wanted to go into research. I wanted to become a physicist, and that was where my passion was. But then during my studies, some friends of mine started doing this strange thing. They went into management consulting. I didn't even know how to spell it. I had no idea what it was about. But what they told me was quite interesting. I ended up doing an internship with a consulting firm. I learned more in the two months there than I had in the last two years in my physics job at university. That is how I ended up in consulting. She started her career with three years at McKinsey, then spent four years in private equity with APAC's partners in London, before joining Deutsche Post DHL Group in 2004. I was brought into the company to do international M&A project. That was at the time around 20 years ago, when we were really building the company in the current shape, acquiring lots of logistics companies around the world. The M&A part was the first thing, and I then wandered into a more mainstream finance field here in the group, becoming the CFO of our DHL Express Division. So from then on, it was more leading towards the CFO role eventually. Melanie Christ now heads the finance team with around 11,000 employees. Success in this role is as much an art as a science. If you do the greatest piece of analysis, and you see it all, and you know it all, but you can't convey that message, and you can't convince the rest of the organisation that we should move into a certain direction, it's useless. DHL is sending a consistent message with its investments. The company spent 123 million euros to upgrade its logistic centre at the Clone Bon Airport, designing it around key strategic goals. What I love about this building is it actually shows the big mega trends which formed our strategy 2025, which was inaugurated in 2019 when this building opened. So, globalisation connecting the world. E-commerce, we have a lot of sortation facilities here for smaller e-commerce shipments. Sustainability, it's a very sustainable building, there's solar panels on the roof and everything, and digitalisation, and well, you can obviously see that it is quite automated. How did the team pitch this investment to you initially? And how hard was it as a sell for them? How quickly did you turn around and say, yes, this is worth the 123 million euros? Of course, you always have to make sure that you have the right capacity for the growth in the network. And at that time, they came and said, hey, we will really see a strong growth in e-commerce volumes on top of the regular B2B growth. We need more sorting capacity, we need this building. And of course, there are always debates, that they really have to cost 123 million euros.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1032,2022-11-20 01:16:03
18419," On top of the regular B2B grows, we need more sorting capacity, we need this building. And of course, there are always debates, doesn't really have to cost 123 million euros and so on. But fortunately, they convinced us because then with COVID and the volume search, we are truly needed for capacity. At the same time as COVID accelerated demand for logistic services, disruptions in the labor supply hurt productivity. Advances and technology like this digital sauter have helped offset some pressures, but automation also raises questions. Does this tell us that this is the business grows? This is going to become a more automated business, that it's going to be less need for labour for workers. Well, you still see people here and I think what you can nicely, what you see is the combination of technology which supports people. So for example, when you look at the customs area, it used to be a very manual and sometimes confusing process. Now the people are supported in picking the right treatments for customs inspections by light and they are automatically sorted in this sauter to go to customs inspections. So it is also helping the people with the jobs they're doing here every day. We have a set here in 2019-20. We might get one-third less jobs in the current setup until 2030 if we digitalise the organisation. But we are very sure that our company will be at least 50, maybe 100% bigger and we will have more jobs to offer. At the beginning of a couple of years ago when we started that journey, people said, oh, you know, I might lose my job. I haven't heard that in the last two years as a question in any town hall. This airport hub also showcases DP DHL's Aviation Fleet which both small than 320 dedicated cargo aircraft. The biggest chunk of our aircraft but we also have short and medium and long term leases and visit growth in our business. We anticipate that the people keep going. You've talked about investing, of course, in sustainable fuel. Yes. When does that come online? How significant is it? Is it just the critics might say that's just window dressing around a part of the business that is of course very carbon intensive, at least a lot of emissions? Yes. So you absolutely write the problem with our beautiful aircraft is the CO2 emissions. And when you look at our overall CO2 emissions, two-thirds are from aviation. It is about flying these birds with more sustainable fuel. We have had that we are really willing to spend billions on it. We now really hope that we will see the uptick and supply over the next years. Spending billions isn't vague hyperbole. The company has pledged to put seven billion euros towards sustainable technologies and fuels by 2030, with a goal of climate neutral logistics by 2050. Sustainability makes good business sense anyway, especially if you are in a business that is energy or fuel hungry as a compliance element that not just operators in the logistics sector need to consider, but also their customers. So being transparent becomes part of the service about their impact on the globe. We had a lengthy discussion should we make a financial commitment how much we want to invest for the next decade in our sustainability? We had a long debate is it right to say we want to invest seven billion until 2030. There were pros and cons, but that was a very intense discussion melody in I-Hart, where we finally came to the conclusion that this is a right number, this is a right approach. We convinced our colleague and that's the reason why we are where we are, where we are seen as somebody who really commit. They're not that many companies who have quantified their future investment. Still ahead how one of the business world's most influential women is working to strengthen gender equality within her company. I think the great thing is that now across the board in finance, but also in the group overall, we have role models which show young female talent that everything is possible. This is Bloomberg. Why do the biggest names in business choose Bloomberg? I had to do a great question. Great question. I get all night. What do you think of when you think of a battery?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1033,2022-11-20 01:20:23
18420," Great question, best question I get all night. Remember, top experts, great questions. What do you think of when you think of a battery? For most, it's what we use to power devices for both work and play, and maybe even your car. Over the past few decades, they've gotten way more powerful, long-lasting and affordable. But all of this is just a prologue to what the next battery's going to do. As we drive to an increasingly renewable power-driven grid, we also need to be able to store energy and release it later to cover those periods of weather intermittencies that are driving this new grid that we're in. It's a multi-trillion dollar opportunity, and it's imperative that we figure out the solution here. How we store energy on a massive scale is in many ways the central challenge of the fight to stop climate change. You will put a woman on Mars. You will bring forth global cooling. You will be the first Chief Crypto Officer. Because when you subscribe to Bloomberg, you won't just get news. You'll get insight into limitless possibilities, knowledge and inspiration to feed your ambition. So before you invent pioneer disrupt, before you change the world, Bloomberg. Do it your post DHL Group's CFO Melanie Christ is often named to lists of the most powerful women in business. And while men still outnumber women as finance heads of large companies, there are signs that the balance is shifting. The number of female CFOs across major US companies has risen to an all-time high, according to a study by Chris Colder Associates. An executive search firm Cohen Partners reports that 36% of new CFOs hired by notable companies in the first half of 2022 were women. I ask Melanie Christ if she's encountered obstacles as a woman rising through the executive ranks. I have to say I have not made many negative experiences. Maybe I was also a little bit naive in not thinking about these challenges so much. So when I studied physics, there weren't many women, so I was always used to it. And it can also be an advantage when you're the only girl in the room. I mean the boss at the end remembers your name and not the 19 guys who all wear dark suits and white shirts and look alike. So I never experienced it as an external stress factor. I have to say for me personally it was more balancing my own expectations around kind of like getting family and the job combined. But that was probably more of a pressure I put on myself thinking that I had to be perfect in every dimension and not something where the pressure was put on me from my male colleagues. Hmm. So how do you take that experience and put it to play in terms of how you advance the role of women in this organization? I think the great thing is that now across the board in finance but also in the group overall, we have role models which show young female talent that everything is possible. In finance we have a share of women in management of 32%. So we are ahead of the group. We want to get to 35% by 2025. I think we are now at a position where if we have a vacancy, I want to have at least one woman on the short list because we have enough female talent. So every short list should contain a woman and then the best.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1034,2022-11-20 01:24:33
18421," If you have a vacancy, I want to have at least one woman on the shortlist. Because we have enough female talent. So every shortlist should contain a woman, and then the best person in the race should win. CEO, Frank Appell, says Christ sets an example for the entire organisation. And he believes her success may influence the entire industry. She has proven that she is an outstanding CEO for all. And she's definitely a role model in many dimensions. That's what I like about there. She is still a very warm and nice person. And that makes such a big difference. So you can get to that level without compromising on how nice you are as a person. I think she's a great role model. And I hope that this has had positive impact for many of us. From the big picture down to the smallest operational details, Melanie Christ is fully engaged in guiding DP DHL into the future. I wanted to know what she sees when she looks ahead. What juice is the biggest opportunities for DP DHL over the next 10 years? I think we have a fantastic portfolio. And we just have to leverage the growth opportunities which are there, both on the ECOM site and also on the traditional B2B site. And the key differentiators for us will be digitalisation, sustainability and our great people. As you look ahead 10 years, what are some of the challenges? What keeps you up at night as you think about the business going forward? I think we have to keep this focus and the ability to adjust in a very at-law way. Sometimes when you kind of like think about all the risk controlling and stuff, people tend to create the impression that you can pre-plan everything. That's clearly not the case. So I think we have to stay focused and keep the ability to react in a very at-law way. But looking at what happened over the last 24 months, I'm very optimistic that we will also be able to cope with whatever happens next. And how do you see your role changing in the years ahead? I think it is changing at a very rapid pace, which is a great thing because it never gets boring. Those elements I just mentioned for the group overall, digitalisation and sustainability are also hugely relevant for the finance role. It's like a new language you have to learn. And you learn the vocabulary, but then you also have to develop a feeling if I kind of like put so much capital into this decarbonisation measure, I get so much in terms of return out of it. But that's a fascinating opportunity where we can make a huge difference for finance and for the group overall. As you look to the future, Melanie, what do you think is going to be the skill sets? The knowledge bases, they're going to be essential to the success of future CFOs. Yes, probably the two most essential new skills will be to get even better at lifelong learning because we will have to learn so much new stuff every year. Be it in the digitalisation area, be it on sustainability. So this ability also has a 50-year-plus-old person to keep learning and keep the curiosity. I think that is going to be super essential. And the second element will be being a great team player. The world is complex, you can't know it all. So you really have to work even more strongly with your team. What advice would you give to someone who's just recently been appointed CFO? That's a great question. I think I would probably simply say, be curious and ask as many questions as you can. Try to learn as much as possible, not only in the finance area, but get close to the business. Try to really understand the business because only when you are close to the business and you understand the fundamental profit drivers will be a really great CFO. I'm Tom McKenzie. This is Bloomberg. What do you formula one cars and your local supermarket have in common? Well, strange as it sounds, they might both be using the same technology. A lot of innovation has trickle down from the world of high tech engines and it hasn't just found a new life in road cars. F1 cars have long been thought of as the peak of cool. And technology in them is also helping to pull down our produce aisles. Engineers from Williams are using their knowledge from nine instructors championships working with company aeroplane.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1035,2022-11-20 01:28:59
18422," And technology in them is also helping to pull down our produce aisles. Engineers from Williams are using their knowledge from nine instructors championships working with company Aerofoil to help reduce the energy consumption of supermarkets. The device they're building is based on the design of an F1 cars rear wing. It attaches to fridges to keep more cool air in the unit. They estimate it can reduce super market energy consumption by 25%. One innovation from F1 is also helping hybrids reduce their carbon footprint. That's curves or the kinetic energy recovery system. In common parlance it's known as regenerative braking and works by storing energy of the car decelerating in a battery for later use. If that's not enough, F1 is now looking at curves or a thermal energy recovery system looking to harness the heat produced from braking and the engine exhaust. That could allow cars to generate the same power using 30% less fuel. So, while F1 may have a reputation as a gas puzzler, some of its innovations in the name of speed are helping in the everyday fight against climate change. Back in 1997, I was interested in the following question, which is there are a bunch of the dinosaurs called Saurapod dinosaurs, which had really long skinny necks. So, Apatosaurus is an example. Now, it's had really long skinny tails. So, I made a computer model that showed that in fact the tail of these Saurapod dinosaurs could actually act like a whip, a bullfip. Now, the way a bullfip makes that cracking noise is because the tip of the whip actually goes about twice the speed of sound. Okay. And that crack is a sonic boom. Yep. I think the way they got a date was to impress the females by making loud booms. You will shed light on dark matter. You will make aging optional. You will turn 5G up to 11. Because when you subscribe to Bloomberg, you won't just get news. You'll get insight into limitless possibilities, knowledge, and inspiration to feed your ambition. So, before you invent pioneer, disrupt. Before you change the world, Bloomberg. Youflation is a terrible thing. Inflation, you could tolerate. You could treat anything as a trend for. You think about Bitcoin. I don't think it's a currency. I think it's a commodity. Today, we're in and everything. Genial and unflapable, even in the heat of a corporate crisis. That's a reputation of CS Venkata, Krishnan. Known as Venkata, amongst colleagues of former Barquays markets chief, took over as chief executive after just Staley's abrupt exit in November last year. In his first TV interview since getting the top job, we talk about the bank's so-called universal model of retail, corporate, and investment banking. So, what are the challenges that lie ahead and where does he see opportunities? Will Barquays have to increase provisions for low losses as a cost of living crisis gets worse? Over the next 30 minutes, we talk strategy, investment banking in Europe, the future of the city of London, and how inflation will change the banking world, with the man who's in charge of Barquays for lost 12 months. Venkata, thank you so much for speaking to Bloomberg. So, 12 months into the job, what have you learned about yourself in the bank? The last 12 months have been a wonderfully educational experience. About myself, I've learned how much more I needed to learn about banking, including running a large organization, finding ways to encapsulate what our ambitions are, and to convey and get to so many people, and then visiting all the global footprint of the bank we have. It's also been a wonderful year in terms of the bank's operational performance. We've managed a bunch of crises, and we've managed them in implementing climate change.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1036,2022-11-20 01:33:28
18423," It's also, you know, it's been a wonderful year in terms of the bank's operational performance. We've managed a bunch of crises and we've managed them relatively well, I think. But it's the start. We are in a middle of a tough economic environment. So in terms of strategy, the strategy hasn't changed that much from your predecessor. Is it about execution or is it a different lens that you're looking at it with? So I was part of the team that set up the strategy seven years ago. And our strategy then was to simplify our footprint, focus on building a global investment bank that was, you know, very highly competitive. We are now number six, we have the biggest European investment bank. It was about doubling down on the UK where we want to be a leading financial institution in sort of everything, retail and wholesale. So building up a very specialized consumer business in the US, which we've done. We like the footprint, the businesses are operating well. I think now it is this driving to excellence, which is to make sure that in all the businesses which we do, clients and customers know what we are about, we do the things that we do very well. We don't have hobbies, we are very focused, we execute well, and it's about excellence. But can you really compete with the US bank in terms of having an investment bank? Can Europe have that leverage or are you always going to be one step below? So we are competing. We are number six. We've been gaining market share and share revenue share in our markets business for many years. And, you know, we are under no illusion that we're not going to catapult, no, do we want to catapult the number three or number two. But we can be very good at what we do. And if we are good, people will transact with us and work with us. And you can make a very good living at the size we are. Do you want to get bigger? Is now, if you look at the pipelines and things that are coming through, is now the right time to employ more bankers? Two slightly different questions about getting bigger. One is I think that as long as we do well and organically we grow, that's fine. I wouldn't want to take large steps. But if it happens in an accumulation over a period of time, that's welcome because it's gradual. About bankers, I think it's a question more about what sectors of banking? We've made a big push in sustainability and we continue to expect to do that. And obviously pulling out of some old economy sectors, reducing it not to zero. But there is a shift in the banking wallet and we respond to that. And I think sustainability is very important. Are you expecting more IPOs, more pipelines? You mentioned the environment that's a little bit uncertain at the moment. What does the next 12 months look like? I think it is going to be a difficult environment for the first six to nine months of that 12. I hope by the summer when people are able to sort of see the end of the rate rising cycle, it may not have happened by the summer but hopefully you can forecast the end of it with reasonable confidence, then businesses will feel more confident themselves in what they want to do about their capital raising and capital planning. But I think it'll do a little time before we see that clarity. What's your biggest concern out there on the markets? I think we've had some good results. A lot of it has to do with also how you traded. Your traders perform very well but we have a very uncertain environment. We don't know what inflation looks like, the cost of living. You have exposure to mortgage. There's leverage out there. What keeps you up at night? Well, I think what we've had this year is a series of incidents which would have been difficult to forecast at the start of the year. Even at the start of the year, I think across the industry, people were cautious that we were at the start of a rate rising cycle. It's never good for credit assets in those periods. It's not good for equity assets generally in that period. Then you had the Russia Ukraine war. And then here in the UK, you had that little volatility with GILTS and LDI. So there are pockets where there could be leverage and there are pockets where there may be rapid movements. And in this kind of a rate rising cycle, you would expect to see that happen. So rather than being specific worries about certain things, it's being generally aware that you're driving a car when it's rainy in the roads, maybe slippery. So what does that mean in terms of risk management?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1037,2022-11-20 01:37:42
18424," It's about certain things. It's being generally aware that you're driving a car when it's rainy and the roads may be slippery. So what does that mean in terms of risk management? What does that mean in terms of you preempting some of the things that could go on? We have been operating through the year with relatively less risk. And what I would call relatively less long biased risk, meaning expectations of asset prices to rise, then we would normally have done, or had done a year or two ago. So in the language of traders, we manage from a defensive position. Which means that things could still go wrong in unexpected ways, or that you feel confident that you have this. You live through the financial crisis. And every two weeks, somebody says, this is going to be worse than a financial crisis. This is worse than 70s. What kind of crisis are we going to see and what does it mean for the banks? Yeah. First of all, I don't think as far as the banking system goes, this will be worse than the financial crisis. I think banks are much better capitalized, but much better risk managed, and much more aware of the importance of doing that than they were back then. And the regulators are also much more intimately involved and engaged with the banks in understanding bank exposures. So I think it's not going to be like that. I think from our point of view, and speaking for Barclays, what we have to worry about is the impact on consumers. We are starting at a point where people are have strong balance sheets, and employment is very high. So these are very good initial conditions. But squeezes are coming in different ways. In the UK, to a greater degree than the US, you've got the energy price squeeze. And also in the UK, to a greater degree than in the US, you've got a squeeze coming from higher interest rates and mortgage prices and rents. Because it's more of a variable rate market. It's more of a fixed market than it used to be. But it's more variable than the US is, which has a 15 or 30-year fixed market. But you're not seeing that, right? And consumer spending right now. You're not seeing it in mortgages either. Is there a worry that we're complacent? And then at some point, next year, early next year, it hits us hard. Not that we are complacent. But even though we've started off in a good condition, there are factors that are eroding that strength of the consumer balance sheet. What I'm hoping you see is what people will call a soft landing and a shallow recession, helped by the initial conditions. And so what you might see is an increase in unemployment. You might see some credit weakness among customers. But it won't be so bad that you see distress in society. However, it has to be managed carefully. And it has to be managed aggressively with a balancing of the budget. And that's what the Prime Minister has said in the last couple of days. The Prime Minister has said that the company is now getting hundreds, maybe even thousands of applications. So software has come in to automate the process. You want to write your resume for robots, not for humans. The only job your resume has is to be comprehensible to the software that is reading it. Because that software or robot is going to decide whether or not a human ever gets their eyes on it. These things are programmed by certain seconds. They're programmed by a certain segment of the population that might not be totally inclusive or not be fully aware. Concerns about how this technology could exacerbate discrimination. For the FTC, I think foremost, the FTC needs to be making sure that we're fully understanding this technology. We don't trust companies to self-regulate when it comes to pollution. We don't trust them to self-regulate when it comes to workplace comp. Why on earth would we trust them to self-regulate AI? No one covers the world like Bloomberg. My team thinks 2023. We avoid a recession. I'm a little more skeptical about that. China and the US both do not want to see nuclear force in the European continent. The regulators here in the Bahá'uá is our ongoing with their investigation into FTC. With unmatched reach and resources from more than 120 countries, the moment news breaks 24 hours a day. Bloomberg, your global business authority.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1038,2022-11-20 01:42:07
18425," Our's a day Bloomberg your global business authority Talk to me a little bit about the last six weeks. So you mentioned the guilt Was there a moment where you were in the office thinking like I you know as Barclays You're one of of course the players in selling in buying guilds with the margin calls coming in and saying like I don't know What happens in the next two hours? So first of all I think that I think the the the volatility was managed extremely well By the very effective targeted and time bound Actions of the Bank of England So I think buying gills buying inflation linked gills and then the repo facility that they put in working with the banking system All helped ease the pressure in the crisis and you know you've got 10 year guilt heels now back below where they were No, at the other day of the mini budget on the 23rd of September as for us. I mean we are large in the in the guilds market What was important for us as we saw it was this was not a solvency issue at all for the pension system It was a liquidity issue and it was a liquidity issue Because what was a very important feature of the UK pension system which by the way? I think it's a good feature of the pension system which is a matching of assets and liabilities Which employed leverage created a liquidity problem So a liquidity problem had to be managed and the liquidity problem was managed by the government intervention or the Bank of England intervention The repo facility which allows people to borrow against assets rather than sell them And by slowly releasing the pressure and you know so far so good do you think that will change actually where you're liations around you pensions in the UK So I don't know the answer but I think What is important is the UK pension system in aggregate is very well funded It's about a hundred and twenty five hundred and thirty percent funded ratio which is extraordinarily good Which gives it a good starting point from which to manage to a less leveraged future It is liquidity your the biggest concern for banks right now I mean we're again hearing you know the US Treasury Secretary having to do things maybe to put a bit of extra liquidity or to pat it out in the Treasury market Bank liquidity I don't think is an issue we've had liquidity regimes the you know Fem funding models are much much more robust than they were in the financial crisis I think part of what people are worried about and what they saw in the guilt market was the liquidity in underlying trading Which is that these markets are not deep with smaller bit over small bit offers in large sizes of trades as they used to be 15 years ago and I think Part of it our banks are more prudent in managing their risk So that's a good thing It's a good thing, but it has a consequence That uh that the big providers of liquidity have moved away from the banking system to the by side Do you worry about shadow banking and is there any crossover does that if you look at the system as a whole if there's something wrong with shadow banking does it does it impact the big banks Um, so it impacts the big banks and by shadow banking let's I'll narrow it. I'll narrow it to let's call FinTech company, okay, right So it impacts the banks in a good way in a bad way So in a good way What they have done is they've provided digital technology We Ways of giving services to customers which customers like and it's made us up up all game Right and faster than we would have otherwise and shame on us for not having done it earlier now when they go into credit which some of them have done Uh, they have less regulation than we do Which is Perhaps not good for customers who deal with them who may not get the protections They do think if they deal with us Uh, and perhaps not good for them if they don't lend with quite Uh, the rigor and standards that more established companies might on the second issue that's a supposition. Let's see What's your relationship like with with the new UK government if you had calls have you have they given your assurance about windfall taxes Well, I think the government is brand new Uh, so we obviously many of the faces are very familiar faces and we've been dead at you know in communication with them in many for many years And we always are with with the government and you know we are way to see their proposals on On taxation on fiscal policy",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1039,2022-11-20 01:46:25
18426," with them in many, for many years, and we always are with the government. And, you know, we are waiting to see their proposals on taxation, on fiscal policy, on all aspects of it. Where do you see the city of London being in four or five years? I mean, that's maybe too long a time frame. Should I say 12 months? Well, it's both too long and too short. You know, here we are in the city. And this city has been the center of finance for 300 years. And it needs to be the center of finance for 300 more years. We certainly would wish that that were the case. And it is the center of finance because of an excellent regulatory system, transparent, fair. It is there because of great availability of talent and infrastructure, soft financial infrastructure and hard financial infrastructure. And a part of that is also a stable, predictable taxation regime. So we hope that all those elements and ingredients remain and continue to allow the city to flourish. And you know, the Prime Minister spoke about investing in education in Britain. And if you think about what drives the financial sector, I mean, you meet many of them. It's about the wonderfully trained people in the UK and the wonderfully trained people outside were able to come and work in the UK. The UK has lost something. When City of London has lost business to other parts of the world in terms of, you know, financial capital. What do you need from the government today for that to be reversed? Well, some of it is what others do, right? So once Brexit happened and you could not pass port financial services to London, all the major banks had to set up trading enterprises in Europe. So that is irreversible, let's say, for the time being. I think other than that, what we need is a continuation of what London has provided, you know, education, infrastructure, people, great regulatory regime, and a stable and predictable fiscal regime. Vinka, until not too long ago, Barclays had an activist shareholder on its back. Do you think about that? You always have to think about it. I don't think about it from the point of view of our business mix. I do think we have a good business mix. And that activist shareholder came because he thought we should sell our investment bank. He could not have been more wrong. I repeat it, he could not have been more wrong. The investment bank has been what has kept Barclays flourishing and quite apart from many of our competitors in the fact that, you know, we performed extremely well during COVID. We are able to have a more diversified business model. But I think for many banks like us where our valuations are low, you know, you've always got to be worried about what is driving bank valuations.

Had in the chief executives of Adobe, Deloitte, Gap, VMware, and that doesn't count Indians running companies all over the world. Why have so many Indians risen to the top? For no coastal appoints to India's incredibly competitive education system, if you can survive the pressure it takes to get into one of the Indian institutes of technology, it gives you confidence to handle American universities and later the business world. Meanwhile, the belief in India's ability to produce so many tech wizards is reinforced every year. Indians make up about three-fourths of the immigrants receiving coveted H1B visas for the US. And it's a safe bet that some of them will eventually find their way to the C-suite.

18427," When US jobs numbers are released, Bloomberg brings you crucial data at terminal speed and instant expert analysis. Nobody covers jobs day like Bloomberg. Is Europe over banked? Europe is against separate Europe from the UK. I don't think the UK is over banked. I think part of what drives bank valuations, especially in Europe versus the US, is there is some worry about business model. I think in our case we've got the right business model and what will drive our valuation is solid performance, excellent performance, as I say. Repeated excellent performance. I think in Europe, banking is still fairly nationalized, not nationalized in state owned, but by country. And I think we have to see at some point the experiment of one large European bank crossing borders in a meaningful way. And then we'll know. When do you think that will happen? Or is it just a dream? We've been talking about it. I feel like for two decades. Yeah, I mean it's a question more for the European bank CEOs. I think it should happen. I think the test case should happen. And now is a good time. When you go through a period like this, there will be some banks which will benefit from consolidation and ownership by a larger entity. And I hope I see it happen. And it'll be good for Europe. So your bank is doing pretty well. Others are doing less well. We talk about Credit Suisse almost day in day out. Have you been able to get some business from clients that no longer want to bank with them? Well, business goes or everywhere in the banking industry. Obviously, where Credit Suisse has pulled out of certain businesses such as the prime business, we got some business from their clients. But look, they announced a big restructuring. We wish them well. It is important for the banking system for there to be many players who are strong. And I think with this restructuring, hopefully Credit Suisse is on a good upward trend and regains the prominence it used to have. I think it talked me about some of the human errors, right? The recession that we've been talking about and how much that cost you. I know that there was also, I don't know if it's punishments coming or some, you know, a step towards the people that did those mistakes. Where are we on that? So we had an over issuance of securities in the US. It was completely avoidable. It is one of these embarrassing moments you hate to have when you're CEO of a bank. It is, however, it was a human error in a very narrow way. We have done both and had an external investigation on it and internal investigation. We have made good by all the clients affected. We have had a settlement with the SEC. We cooperated from the first minute, fully with all our regulators. And we dealt with the matter internally. We are in the final stages now where individuals who were affected or involved in this are being assessed. We've got a standard process by which we do that. And yes, there will be, you know, implications for certain individuals, but that process will play itself. I mean, through your strategy, we talked a little bit about, you know, the global economy. Do you worry that this way of inflation is just going to get worse? When will we reach peak inflation? When will we know that we've reached peak inflation? You will know that the rate of change of inflation is stabilizing when the central banks start signaling it that in their rate rises. Going away from 75 basis points, 100 basis points, to something more normal and natural. Now, mathematically, there will be some forces that will bring inflation down, you know, just because base effects as they call them. And I expect that will happen sometime in the middle of next year. Is there a danger that central banks messes up, that they raise interest rates too much? Look, there's always a finely calibrated issue about when do you stop. And I think many people have sort of raised two worries. One is that this is, there's a sort of supply chain led element of this. There's an energy shock element of this. Employment is at all time highs, relatively speaking, and that people have not seen such a hiking cycle in three decades.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1041,2022-11-20 01:55:04
18428," Nijishok element of this employment is at all time highs, relatively speaking, and that people have not seen such a hiking cycle in three decades. Having said that, I think the officials are all, across the world, are all very, very experienced. And I think they'll find the right way to calibrate it. How difficult is it in this uncertain environment, frankly, to calibrate where you want to grow businesses geographically in the world? Well, I'll speak for Barclays. You, we've got a real strength of the business in the US and the UK. We've got a good investment bank in Europe and a trading business. We had caught at an island, but got a large trading presence in France. And then, good presence in Asia, both in the Middle East and India. We've got an excellent investment banking franchise in Singapore and Hong Kong. I expect that footprint to remain broadly as it is. We have some very interesting partnerships in Australia. We might do some others. But I expect the broad footprint to be as it is. The geopolitical complexities, which are also rising, makes people more cautious also about which countries they want to go to. Have you had to increase wages? And I'm not really thinking of the high-flyer bankers, but just to match inflation in most of these places. So we did a fairly large program of wage rises in India, where we've got a large number of employees last year in 2021. In the UK, we did an interim adjustment in August of about 4% for a lot of our workers. And then we are working through another one for the end of this year. And we did one in the US also late last year. So I think inflation, especially as it affects some of our workers, we're going to have to look at it and we're going to have to respond. When you look at the return to the office, I think you, bankers, have to be back four days a week. Yeah. How's that going? It's going well, look. I think we always have to create a balance. There's a level of flexibility that's come into work life into the workplace since COVID, which I think is good. I think some of the stigma attached to working from home has gone away. And I think that's really important, especially for those who are managing young families or have other pressures that require them to spend more time at home or close to home. And I think we should continue that and should continue that in important ways. Some jobs require you to be in the office. Our trading flows are largely full five days a week, and that's the way it should be. Our bank branches here in London also need to be stuffed. And they should be. And for some other functions, it can be less. But I do think it's important for people in all functions at all levels to be in the office. This isn't a apprenticeship business at the end of the day. And it's important to have that productivity from being face to face. When you look at the strength and dollar, I mean, this could be a shorter term. It could last for a very long time if you'll get King Dollar. What does it mean for Berkley's? Well, as a financial matter, it's actually good. We have about 40% of our revenues in dollars. We've got a fairly big business in the US. More broadly, though, I mean, world economies will have to adjust. And that adjustment process can be painful. And you can see the pain it's inflicting in Europe and the UK. Expôt will be subsidized, but in poor prices go up. Thank you so much. Francine, thank you very much for having me. The top names in climate change are on Bloomberg. I want everybody committed to the kind of action that we need. We have a global emergency now. We're still putting 162 million tons of man-made global warming pollution into the sky every day using the skies and open sewer. That's trapping as much extra heat as would be released by 600,000 Hiroshima class at Tommy Kahn exploding every day. That's what the scientists tell us and the data shows it. That's crazy. That's why we have a third of Pakistan underwater. That's why we have the historic heat wave.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1042,2022-11-20 01:59:21
18429," That's what the scientists tell us and the data shows it. That's crazy. That's why we have a third of Pakistan underwater. That's why we have the historic heat waves in China. Nothing comparable to that. Ever. That's why the heat records are broken every year. And we're seeing in an increase in the flows of climate refugees crossing international borders that are due to vastly expand unless we take action to solve the climate crisis. The company covers climate change like Bloomberg, your global business authority. Yeah. Yeah. Mercedes-Benz is on a path towards the two-neutral mobility. So we have picked the switch there and really we're going to step by step electrify everything. And what does that mean? Combustion and yield sketch electrified. Welcome to the earth shot prize innovation summit. This event powered by Bloomberg featured finalists selected by the earth shot council, launched by Prince William, is a global initiative that drives innovation on solutions to climate change and environmental issues in the following categories. Protect and restore nature. Clean our air, revive our oceans, build a waste free world, fix our climate. And over the next half an hour will bring you all the highlights from this most important gathering. This is Bloomberg. Protecting the environment was of course close to my grandmother's heart. And I know she would have been delighted to hear about this event and the support you're all giving our earth shot finalists. The next generation of environmental pioneers. Together in this room are the people and organisations who will help us to achieve the earth shot mission. To repair, restore and rejuvenate our planet within this current decade. That mission is not simple. Just as President John F. Kennedy so famously said, as he challenged the United States for America, to unite behind the goal of putting man on the moon, we choose to do these things not because they are easy, but because they are hard. I know that the world is an uncertain place right now, that many families and communities across the globe are facing unimaginable challenges, from conflicts to energy crisis and food shortages. While addressing these in the short term, we must also remain resolutely focused on tackling the greatest challenges that threaten our tomorrow. Because if we don't, the changing climate will only serve to entrench these immediate challenges into fundamental-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1043,2022-11-20 02:03:34
18430," in the greatest challenges that threaten our tomorrow. Because if we don't, the changing climate will only serve to entrench these immediate challenges into fundamental global issues, severely impacting the lives of each and every one of us. That is why our collective mission is so urgent, but there is huge reason to be optimistic. The 2021 cohort of Earthshot winners and fineness is evidence that we can succeed. That we can protect our world for our children, our grandchildren, and the generations that will follow them. These pioneers exemplify the leadership needed in this decade of change. They include inspiring activists, brilliant innovators, afford thinking city and even an entire country making a real difference. But they cannot do it alone. This must be a team effort. We must come together behind their innovative solutions to ensure they reach their full potential with peace and scale. While my message today is one of gratitude and encouragement, I also acknowledge that you cannot succeed in isolation. As governments, we have a responsibility to create the incentives and the space for you to flourish, a receptive environment for change and the accountability that comes with guardianship. In many nations, the foundation for this approach has been flayed for us long ago if we choose to listen. Where I come from, I'll tear our New Zealand a beautiful place to must visit. Our indigenous people hold a world view that every single living and non-living thing is connected. Our people, our plants, our animals, descendants of Rangamui the Sky Father and Papa Tuanuku, the Earth's mother and their children. And so it follows that people and nature are kin, are family. And we must care for one another in the spirit of Katiaki Tanga, which translates into guardianship by the people of the land for the next generation. In short, Kaua Ho Te Taiau, Kau Te Taiau, Kaua Ho. I am the environment and the environment is me. Our life source, our economy, our future. Now, I've seen this in action first hand many times, not least in my own backyard, the Pacific, where the ocean is a source of protein, income, culture and connection. Now that it is a source of challenge, as it rises up and begins to inundate small island nations, it can be confronting to hear and see the stories of just how real these challenges are, but none of us are here because we have given up, but because we believe there is a way to change the future. We are not only part of the nature, but we are nature. Nature is living element. For indigenous people, nature is whole. Our planet is alive. The rivers are her blood. The trees are her hair. The soil, her skin, the wind, her breeze. And indigenous peoples, our planet, they know, they are the doctor. We are protecting 80% of the world's biodiversity, because our way of life do not harm nature at the opposite. We are strengthening ecosystems. We improve biodiversity by cooperating with the birds and trees, listening to the winds, observing the cloud, learning from even the little insect. We protect nature by setting up our own limits. We don't take more that mother earth can give and we give back. We protect the sacred trees. We don't destroy the field of the medicinal plants. We choose, pre-susely, the animal that we can kill to just keep the balance of the ecosystem. As all of us know in this fight, no one can afford to sit on the sidelines. No one can claim that climate change is somebody else's problem or to forget of for future generations to address. We're all affected by a warming planet. We see that every day. And this against others",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1044,2022-11-20 02:08:05
18431," Orch for a gift for future generations to address. We're all affected by a warming planet. We see that every day. And decisions being made right now will determine our shared tomorrow. So we must choose and we must act as united nations ourselves. Our progress depends on collective action, on collective ingenuity. If we stick together, we can make fixing the climate the greatest project and greatest achievement of our lifetimes. We have the science, we have the solutions. Now all the world needs is political will. Together we can create a future where rampant carbon is removed from the atmosphere. Where green buildings and green business transform the levability of communities. Where easy access to renewable energy enables greater equity. Where sustainable agriculture feeds a growing global population. The needs are urgent. And the costs of inaction are worse than any nightmare. But let us not be driven by, let us be driven by hope, not fear, by optimism, not despair. Because hope is not passive. Hope is the ultimate source of renewable energy. Pushing us forward every day to try and try again. Today, the Earth Shop Prize Innovation Summit in partnership with Mike Bloomberg and Bloomberg Philanthropies will ask each and every one of us what we can do to accelerate progress to repair our planet this decade. And offer solutions on how to collaborate to drive this ambitious but essential climate agenda. We will continue to drive impact around system changing climate solutions and amplify the Earth Shop Prizes call to accelerate progress to repair our planet through collaboration and innovation. But most importantly, we will remind ourselves what can be achieved when we turn pessimism to optimism and optimism into action. Coming up, more from the panelists and finalists here at the Earth Shop Prize Innovation Summit, this is Bloomberg. [♪ Music playing [♪ Big, expensive cities have a lot going for them. But if you live in one, you've probably noticed that these big, expensive cities keep getting more, well, expensive. You could always move away. You might have just started working remotely, so there's really nothing keeping you there. But then again, moving is a hassle. Well, what if someone paid you 10 grand to do it? What if they threw in free office space, a bicycle, or a gym membership? Programs and cities and states around the US are doing exactly that, and they're getting a lot of interest. We've had over 50,000 applications. About 90,000 applications. We had over 1800 applicants from all over North America. So are these nascent programs actually beneficial to their communities and the workers joining them?

18432," Welcome back to the best of the earth's shop prize innovation summit. The guests featured ranged from heads of state to leaders of grassroots environmental organizations. Well amongst them was philanthropist and Microsoft founder Bill Gates. Yeah, it's too bad you can't do things overnight in either mitigation adaptation. And you know, when I last went through Europe, people were the leaders were all saying, hey, give me technologies so I can tell Putin to get lost. And I said, hey, in five years, you're going to be able to call him up. And they were like, no, we'd like it now. It's a year now. Okay, that, how's your planning permission regime and all the, you know, planning for that, that future grid seeds typically between the timing start and they get out in the farmers fields. It's about eight years. Now we have a pipeline of innovations. You know, we've been funding the CG system for 20 years now. It's funded about a billion a year. It's if people care at all about adaptation, that thing will be funded at two billion a year. I mean, there won't be anything close to the impact of climate related seeds, climate related maize, rice, wheat, sort of a millet. And thank goodness because of human genetics, we know how to do the editing. Thank goodness because of AI, we know how to find the alleles, because of drones, we can measure stuff in the field. So there's huge advance in terms of how the whole seed ecosystem moves at full speed. The timing is very tricky here. The warming doesn't stop the day you get to zero emissions. There's a lag in this system, it's about a 20 year lag. So you haven't seen that Earth temperatures not equilibrated to the atmospheric CO2 content. So when you get to zero, that's not like 2051. Take my air conditioner away. No, it starts quite a bit later. And so you have to look at what the peak is and you can't just plan for OK, 2030, 2030's where your maize production in central Africa is down 25%. By 2050, it's down 70%. And you will have switched in most of those areas from a fairly heat sensitive crop to sorghum. Now sorghum productivity is super low. So we'll get people to do better maize for these next 15 years. And then they are going to have to switch to sorghum. It is tough when you see the floods impact us down. I mean, nobody expected that. If the goal of climate was to make us pay attention, wow, that is way beyond expectation. So some adaptation money literally will just be disafferable recovery money. The boundary of what's also pretty confusing. I mean, what is food aid? If climate's causing some food production losses, all world-proof program money, is that all climate adaptation money? It's certainly the need for it's going up. That's a system that's about 6.5 billion a year. So relative to the systemic solution, which is the research piece, it's relatively larger. But the demand for that piece, which is the acute half a Pakistani rice got flushed away. And so you're going to have malnutrition problems if you don't go in for that. That's also a type of adaptation. So I do think we're going to bring some rigor to this because the pressure now, the goal of doubling the adaptation money from, they say, 20 billion a year to 40 billion a year, the pressure on that is the problem. But it's still peanuts. No, it's very small. I mean, literally, yeah, if you start sticking food aid in there, you can use it up very quickly, rebuilding after hurricanes. I mean, we had hurricanes before, but the costs there are absolutely gigantic. There are ways of stopping wildfires. There are ways of dealing with sea level rise. So the innovation.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1046,2022-11-20 02:16:39
18433," are absolutely gigantic. You know, there are ways of stopping wildfires, there are ways of dealing with sea level rise. So the innovation agenda, not just on seeds, the innovation agenda is going full speed on mitigation. That's where, you know, there's a hundred companies break through energy's funded. There's a lot of money. So by mitigation, you mean mostly energy. You mean, everything to do with energy. You mean, generation of energy. You mean batteries, you mean transport, you mean all of the new, and there's some renewables that are already traditional, but more that need to come on. So that's the package that you're talking about mitigation. How are you also talking about agriculture as mitigation? Yeah, so every area of emissions, you know, the world tends to focus on past and your cars and electricity. That's not a third of emissions. And so the focus on the easiest third, you know, now 4% of new cars are electric. You know, so that's the field that we're furthest along. About 4% of energy generation is wind and solar. And as you triple the size of your grid, you want that to be say, you know, some people would say 100%. Other people might say 70 to 80%. You know, the amount you have to build, we're, you know, not within a factor of five of the build rate of those. But those are the easy sectors. Sement, you know, clean cement costs over twice as much as the way we make cement today. And it's not, it's partly the heating energy. It's partly the basic thing, you know, remember in chemistry when you take calcium carbonate and heat it, you get calcium, that's what makes cement. But the thing that goes away, that's CO2. And so we have to have a way of making cement, which a number of these innovative. And a steel and iron. Yep. There's a whole family of hard to obeyed sectors. That's true. If you get a dead industrial sector, if you get green hydrogen that's cheap enough, it actually solves quite a large number of those. Some of the industrial processes, you go straight to electricity. And some you go through, you do your reduction using the, the hydrogen where you would have used some hydrocarbon concept before. For steel, we actually have companies doing both. We have electricity steel and others doing electricity as the way of replacing the blast furnace. And then we have others that take hydrogen. And if you get the hydrogen cheap enough, you get the super magic thing, which is that the green product doesn't cost more. That's called green premium equals zero. And then your adoption scale is utterly different. If we try to subsidize steel and cement, say rich countries say, OK, we want to get rid of that, which those two are 15% of emissions, that's greater than all foreign aid budgets put together. It's over 200 billion foreign aid. Never will pass that number. It's just not politically possible. It's a number that's at about 170 and going down today. Coming up, but more from the panelists and finalists here at the earth's shop prize innovation side. This is Bloomberg. MUSIC The tape is crucially important. And I think we've moved from this attitude, from its indulgence, a waste of time, almost an illness that needs a cure. For something as universally important to human life as sleep, mysteries surrounding its necessity and utility have only just been recently uncovered. Some of our biggest discoveries were in the 1970s or 1980s. And so it makes that a really exciting field, because it seems as though we're uncovering new insights each and every day. Some scientists are going further to find out how sleep and what happens there can be harnessed to further expand our understanding. It's easy to memorize. That makes you smart. If you can spit back a lot of facts. But if you want to be wise, if you really want wisdom, you've got to know when and how and why to use that information. And that's what your brain figures out while you're sleeping.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1047,2022-11-20 02:21:01

Are you optimistic that can be done. I am optimistic. There's no choice I've seen firsthand the potential that a breakthrough idea can hold and if we start seeing more of these transformative solutions across all the challenges facing our planet and suddenly our earth shot won't seem so improbable The work will be difficult. It'll take extraordinary resources Determination partnership, but we've got all the essentials right here in this room So what is the challenge? It's the speed scale and cost of making these green hydrogen generators Well, that's exactly what we are working on Because to make green hydrogen the fuel source of the future it needs to be cheaper than fossil fuels And that means Electrolyzers are going to need to be really really cheap if you want to take a solution around the globe as quickly as possible You need to make it standardized mass-produced commodity a product that is easy to make and quick to build and cheap as well And so while some believe Electrolyzers need to be large machines We believe the electrolyzer should be a standardized mass-producible product that can make green hydrogen Anywhere for anyone In 2030 we imagine millions and millions of projects on restore and not just places on earth where We see nature being brought back But all of the other nodes that are key to ensuring success So the technology providers the nurseries the seed banks the funders the government incentive program",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1048,2022-11-20 02:25:19
18435," There are nodes that are key to ensuring success. So the technology providers, the nurseries, the seed banks, the funders, the government incentive programs, so that we have an ecosystem that really allows us to leverage the many, many connections within the nature-based solution space. And in 2030, we have been focused on another key area, which is cities and cities require data and insights to take action on climate and to preserve nature, to create more nature and tree canopy. So we've set a goal that we want to- We want more nature in cities, exactly. Exactly, right. And so we've been partnering with cities like Los Angeles to give them insights, utilizing AI and geo mapping on where all the places that you can create more tree canopy, which reduces urban heat islands, improves air quality sequesters carbon. So we want to bring data and solutions to bringing nature into cities, as well as, of course, preserving and restoring nature. And so one of the goals that we've set is we want to enable over 500 cities around the world. I know we're going to hear from the mayor of Paris after this to reduce a gigaton of carbon emissions by 2030. And so that's through data, tools, and sites, whether that's evolving transportation systems or planting new tree canopy. So that's a big bold target that we want to see achieved by 2030. Anyway, I guess I'm in the wrong place. I came here to invite all of you to the Grouch Convention. But it turns out you're all about my least favorite thing, helping. Oh. You've got me, Oscar. I do like helping people learn how to reuse repurpose and recycle. Together, everyone in this room can build a world where nothing goes to waste. And that includes even you. Me? Sorry, my guy. I got to get going to that convention, but just between us. Yes. I do have a recycling bin right next to my can. But no, I think it out OK. It'll ruin my image. But my father believed in the power of the idea. And over time, the vision, the purpose, the courage, it embodied, has inspired each generation to take on its own challenges, not because they're easy, but because they're hard. President Kennedy understood that the effort to land on the moon would bring out the best in us that everyone would have to contribute, that it would require innovation, creativity, teamwork, commitment, and faith. And that world would be better because of it. The Earth Shot Prize has inspired the same spirit of optimism and ingenuity on a global scale to tackle the most pressing challenge we now face, repairing the planet. My family and I are so excited that the Prince of Wales will honor this year's Earth Shot Prize winners in partnership with the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston, a city that is committed to scientific excellence, environmental justice, and the fight against climate change. We're proud that President Kennedy's moonshot legacy still inspires hope, and we look forward to welcoming all of you who are working to ensure a better future here on Earth.

Especially, you know, we are a small company in a way, and you have to fight people who have those huge companies who put you 27 lawyers on your back for something which is yours. It's very stressful. I mean, I wish it didn't happen. Everything which happened to me is a lesson in a way, bad or good. And once it's done, it's done, and you're sort of happy. I mean, I'm happy about it. That thing I could have definitely avoided.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1049,2022-11-20 02:29:42
18436," To me is a lesson in a way, bad or good. Once it's done, it's done. I'm happy about it. That thing I could have definitely avoided. But it's done. Did you realize at the time when you started the company that you would become so successful? I'm actually so big. No, no. When I started the company, I wanted to have a shop in Paris, which is my hometown. And I wanted to do pretty shoes for pretty girls. That was my goal. Now you look back and you say, actually, I still make pretty shoes, but for many more women. Yeah, absolutely. Do you think you would have been so successful without the Red Soul? I think the Red Soul definitely, of course, participates to my work, but also to the fame of my shoes, because it's instantly recognizable. But then, you know, the design is very important. But definitely, when you have such a strong sign of recognition, it participates to... Yeah. You've got to explain this one to me. What does it mean when the White House says we're watching markets carefully? It means they have a Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. They have been an insane... Lots of Bloombergs. Lots of Bloombergs. Lots of Bloombergs. Lots of Bloombergs. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. What does it mean? It means they have a Bloomberg. Welcome to the world of decentralized finance. Bloomberg's covering all things crypto. The people, the transactions, and the technology. Bloomberg crypto Tuesdays. When Jack Hartung joined Chipotle 20 years ago, he was far from the powerhouse it is today. Chipotle was a special brand. It was an unknown brand. It was very small. Founded in 1993 by Chef Turnodrapreneur Steve L. The company stood on the brink of the growth spurt that would create a category, fast casual dining. It was a really simple idea, Steve had. It was, look, why is fast food crappy? Why can't great food be done fast? I was there when there was just a couple dozen restaurants and I would visit restaurants like this and I would go to the restaurant and see if there was a store or a steve would go behind the line and see somebody cutting it on you and saying, well, hold on, let me show you how to do it. Two decades later, Jack Hartung is still the chief financial officer of Chipotle. He's had a hand in just about every area of the operation. I feel like I've always been able to dabble and things outside of just financials. And while his central task is to create greater value for a chain that now has about 3,000 restaurants, I think I'm really open-minded, but I really do want to protect the heritage of Chipotle and make sure that we don't lose the essence. It's a powerful blend, a consistent mission that sustains the brand with a commitment to innovation that drives the business. Chipotle's future depends on investments that address both priorities. Jack Hartung embraces that challenge. He's always had a passion for what we do next that our company because he's always been really a champ and really a champion of growth. I've got to make sure that the financials, the balance sheet, the way we source through, the way that we provide through, the way that our business works, needs to be strong so that we reach our full potential. I love working with people that can figure out how to thread the needle between the numbers and the purpose. Frankly, not everybody can do it, but luckily, Jack does it really well and we're pretty fortunate to have him at our company. Chipotle's growth in the last five years has been nothing.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1050,2022-11-20 02:34:08
18437," The company's market capitalization has more than quadrupled. All this, despite a global pandemic, that's disrupted the restaurant industry. And all this, following a food safety crisis that caused sales at the company to crater and forced a shake-up in the C-suite. Individually, the team was phenomenal. Individually, people were very talented. But it's almost like they didn't have the right people in the right places to handle how big the brand and the platform became. The enhanced food safety procedures, enhanced standards and training. They really enhanced the management team took marketing dollars, you know, transitioned them to more effective marketing, brand building efforts with a big focus on reminding consumers of why they love Chipotle. The breakdown was the human capital. The breakdown was in culture. And that's what they've repaired. And that's why they're coming back stronger. What have you learned in your CFO position going through those crises? What was the most challenging? The food safety issue was the most challenging because we were alone in that one. That was unique to Chipotle. The pandemic is certainly a challenge, but everyone's in it together. The things that really got us through it is we stay true to our purpose. So during each of these challenges, we made sure we invested in the things that made Chipotle special, invest in higher quality food, invest in our people, and then invest in our growth and invest in things like technology. We have the same around here. I think it actually comes from West Point. You know, we will choose the harder right over the easy road. How do you and Jack work on things like that? Those black swan events, those things that can be, you know, fundamentally changing for you as a company. When we are successful in focusing on the really important things that can strategically drive growth for us, they seem to be having resiliency in these unexpected events. The other thing I think is to make sure you have a strong balance sheet to make sure you can weather this dorm. And we've had a strong balance sheet, we've never had debt. We've always had more cash in the balance sheet than we need for our normal ongoing business. And that has come in, you know, great, you know, really handy. Chipotle carries no long-term debt and it's free cash flow almost tripled in 2021. Can you think about the future? How do you take advantage of this and what is the flexibility that that enables? What it really affords us is we're going to be able to invest in our future, no matter what. Like we accelerated our open, we accelerated our pursuit of new restaurant sites during the pandemic when some of their restaurant companies were laying off their development team. Chipotle not only expanded its footprint over the last two years, it reshaped its restaurants, adventured to drive through dining that began several years ago, became a thriving profit center when the pandemic struck. The thing that's changed the most is just most of our restaurants now have a Chipotle. So three years ago we had maybe five or six Chipotle's and now we have over 350 and 80% of our new openings have a Chipotle. The sales in our Chipotle restaurants are higher and our margins are higher too because the digital orders are our highest margin transaction and when you can serve the customer through the Chipotle without the delivery fees that we pay and the customers pay, it's a great margin opportunity for us. The convenience of Chipotle's contributed to soaring digital sales in 2020. There was little erosion in 2021, even as in-restaurant sales returned to 80% of 2019 levels. Meanwhile, membership in loyalty programs has boomed, giving Chipotle valuable insight into its customer's omnichannel preferences. What we've seen is that our digital customers, they come the most often and they spend the most each time they come. Customer loyalty could face a test if inflation continues to push higher. Chipotle hiked menu prices roughly 9% in 2021. Jack Hartung says it's not just wages and food costs that are putting on the pressure. It's hitting everything. Titting material is too for a restaurant, so our new restaurants are costing more as well. You guys have had incredible pricing power. Is there a tipping point where it's like enough? We haven't seen it. Why is that Jack? What part of it is...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1051,2022-11-20 02:38:27
18438," You guys have had incredible pricing power. Is there kind of a tipping point where it's like enough? We haven't seen it. Why is that Jack? Well, part of it is we've over the years been slow to raise prices. We've always tried not to go to the menu board to raise prices, whenever we've had a challenge from a cost standpoint. We'll do other things to try to find efficiencies somewhere along the line. We raised prices in the second quarter of last year. We did that just to cover the cost of raising wages. We raised wages up to $15, it was an average of 15% increase. And we raised prices just to cover the dollar cost of that. So we didn't increase our margins. Our margins actually went down, but our profitability stayed the same. Our customers actually said, we really applaud what you're doing. We're fine with a 4% price increase. Not a chicken burrito, that's 30 cents. But the fact that you increase wages to that extent, we'd like you to eat a more Chipotle. CEO Brian Nichol has warned that Chipotle may raise prices again if cost pressures intensify. With the cost of eating out already at historic levels, consumers may just have to get used to paying more. The industry is used to have an inflation. Call it 2%, you know, level inflation. They take, you know, a little bit of priced offset, it flows through and margins are just naturally restored. The fact of the matter is labor was the pressure point. So the industry today is definitely sitting on a high single digit price versus what is typically a low single digit price inflation or level of menu price increase. In relative terms, everyone has to do this. In fact, I would say, Carl, we could be more patient than others because we own all of our restaurants. When you're a franchise organization, when you have franchisees that have borrowed to invest in their business, they can't necessarily afford to let inflation eat away at their ability to pay the debt for very long. It is full speed ahead when it comes to store growth. Chipotle just upped its goal to 7,000 from 6,000 restaurants in the U.S. Thanks in large part to strong performance, it's seeing it smaller towns. Based on, we're already in more than 100 of them. Based on the ones we're in, based on the results so far, which are extraordinary, we think there is as many as almost a thousand more restaurants. So even though you're talking about a small town with, you know, maybe 20, 30,000 people, the sales volumes are almost the same as if you, you know, we're in a city like Chicago or a Chicago suburb, but the investment costs are lower, the rents are certainly lower, and the operating costs are lower. So you end up getting higher margins and higher returns. Chipotle reaps the full benefit of these returns since it owns and operates all its stores, an advantage that's not lost on Wall Street. It's extremely unusual in not only restaurants, but from a restaurant's stock perspective, to have a large cap stock that's growing its unit level economic model, meaning the revenues are getting better and the margins are getting better, as growth is accelerating. It's just, it's like almost unheard of. So there's little reason for Chipotle to begin franchising in the United States. But for the chain's 45 international restaurants, Bloomberg Intelligence notes that partnering with local operators overseas might boost margins and accelerate expansion. We're open to the idea of some kind of franchise model. You know, there are areas of the world where it's going to be harder for us to own and to run the businesses ourselves when the process of bringing our digital system to Europe that's going really, really well. We've also opened up some alternative sites. It gives us great optimism that international is going to be a growth vehicle for us and hopefully not to this future. Coming up, Jack Hartung shows me around one of Chipotle's newest restaurants, and he explains the economics of menu innovation. When you bring something new, does it bring in additional customers? Does it bring existing customers more often? This is Bloomberg. Bloomberg has enhanced search on the terminal to deliver what you need when you need it.

Like to Poetlay's menu, Jack Hartung's professional resume isn't patented out with exotic ingredients. After earning a bachelor's degree in MBA at Illinois State, he went straight to an accounting job at Cooper's in Lyberton. His next stop, 18 years at McDonald's. They called me up and McDonald's was just a few miles down the road. And this place is great. And what they told me was great about it was you started in one area, but then when a job opens up, they would post it and you can interview for it. So I felt, well, that sounds great. So I can learn a job. And then if I'm looking for another opportunity, I can interview for it. And if I've done a good job, I'll get those opportunities. Which is what happened? I am curious when you went from McDonald's to Chipotle where folks like, Jack, here you've got the established company you're going to start it. I mean, did people think you were crazy? Yeah, I mean, a lot of people thought I was crazy. In fact, one memorable person was a CEO of McDonald's at the time because I had a great career at McDonald's and the future looked really, really good. At Chipotle, it was in its infancy and it had this vision for food. That was like no other than I've seen. How much of it was? McDonald's own 90% of Chipotle. How much of it was? All right, Jack. Keep an eye on these guys. You know, that's how it started. And it wasn't keep an eye on it, but it was more, their food culture was very advanced. Their business culture was not. And so it was more of bringing some of your experience to Chipotle, just so you can get them on a stronger track. Once I got into Chipotle environment and I realized, oh my god, I want to be part of this. There was a passion about what we were doing. So it wasn't a finance job anymore. It was a job that was really changing food culture in this country. And it was a mission. And it was a mission that I totally bought into. Chipotle's culture and mission have long differentiated it as a place to eat. With restaurants competing fiercely for employees in the wake of the pandemic, companies are going to have to show that they are great places to work as well. It's not just about that person coming back to work in the restaurant. They're going to come back, but they're not going to come back and work the way they did before. I think that the companies that win are those that are investing in their employees, their teams that are developing a strong culture that people want to be a part of. The real win on a micro level is if restaurants can figure out how to make that employee work better and more efficiently, but in a way that makes them more satisfied. At this new location just outside Chicago, Jack Hartung told me what it will take to build a workforce to meet Chipotle's goals. You've got to start with attractive wages, but then you've got to go wavy on that. You've got to offer developmental opportunities, promotional opportunities. We have 100,000 employees, as we grow from 3,000 restaurants to 7,000 restaurants, we're going to need 200 or 250,000 employees. So our future depends on hiring great crew today. That will be great managers in the future. Double the locations, double the staff, and along with investing in people, Chipotle plans to invest in technology to support them. There is so much still that can be done with artificial intelligence, robotics.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1053,2022-11-20 02:47:07
18440," Pay plants invest in technology to support them. There is so much still that can be done with artificial intelligence, robotics. When you think about our system, there are a lot of processes that frankly people don't love doing cutting and courting avocados in the restaurant. Not a fun job, very repetitive. I think there's a way where we could use robotics to help us do that. And then as you think about artificial intelligence, we could be better at figuring out how many avocados we have to cut and core to it. So that we never run out of walkable leaves throughout the day. As digital orders have surged, Chipotle has adapted its processes. The most dramatic change has been the addition of a second make line. This is very familiar to customers, our front line. And this is what for the first, you know, call it 18 years of Chipotle, this was you come in Chipotle along the line, you interact with the crew and you customize your meal. We've got this separate make line and it's digitized. So the orders come in and they're really kind of staged so that if you say at noon, I want to commit at one o'clock, we hold that order and we will send it to the crew like a maybe 10 to one. Right. So it's ready right when you pull up your car. How do you manage these kind of two different staffing needs, right? Making sure you have the right amount of people at the right time. We spend a lot of time projecting sales. A lot of it is, you know, it's part art, part science. We're trying to bring more science and more AI into it. Because if you get the right sales projection, then you know exactly what your staffing needs to be. So if you get the sales right, you can get the entire restaurant staff perfectly with just a couple of people. Our average restaurant now does about over a million dollars per restaurant in digital sales. Data science meets culinary art in Chipotle's commitment to menu innovation. By releasing several new items each year, management hopes to boost same store sales. It seems to be working, but it's more complicated than it looks. The most important thing is to make sure that the economics work, meaning when you bring something new, does it bring in additional customers? Does it bring existing customers more often? There's always going to be trade off from one menu item to another and there could be economic either advantages or disadvantages. So we just want to understand that, you know, when a customer comes in, if they're trading from a high margin item to a low margin item, that's going to be a loser for us. And any new offering must meet Chipotle's rigorous sourcing standards. It will take us a year and a half from the time that we are experimenting in the test kitchen to will put it into a few restaurants to see how does it work operationally and do customers like it. But it'll take us a year and a half because we've then got to build up supply chain. It's a challenge, but we take our time and we're not going to roll it out before it's ready. Jack Hartung clearly places a high value on the customer experience and the experience of those who work at Chipotle restaurants. He's a people person and a family man with five children and ten grandchildren. Even his favorite hobby brings family into play. It's a passion for collecting and restoring classic cars. I drive very conservatively so I'm not like ripping down the highway or anything, but these are cars that I really cared about and really admired and aspired to when I was young. So I still love these cars. There's a bonding that goes on as well. One of my sons is a mechanic. So he's a mechanic for Tesla. And he loves cars and so we send time to car shows together. We'll go to auctions and look for cars. And so we have a great time and he knows how to fix the cars and I know how to drive the cars. And so that's kind of the partnership that we have. But we have a great time together. Up next, sustainability is much more than a buzzword for Chipotle and it's more than figures on a spreadsheet for Jack Hartung. Jack is 100% bought into our purpose of cultivating a better world. He tells me what a chief future officer has to learn not to do. Every CFO knows how to read financial statements and go through what a CFO is supposed to do. But I think what you have to do is put those aside at some point. This is Blueburg. George is",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1054,2022-11-20 02:51:36
18441," It is crucially important and I think we've moved from this attitude, from its indulgence, a waste of time, almost an illness that needs a cure. For something as universally important to human life as sleep, mysteries surrounding its necessity and utility have only just been recently uncovered. Some of our biggest discoveries were in the 1970s or 1980s, and so it makes that a really exciting field, because it seems as though we're uncovering new insights each and every day. Some scientists are going further to find out how sleep and what happens there can be harness to further expand our understanding. It's easy to memorize things that makes you smart if you can spit back a lot of facts, but if you want to be wise, if you really want wisdom, you've got to know when and how and why to use that information. And that's what you bring figures out while you're sleeping. Essential pillar of Chipotle's business has always been a commitment to fresh food and supportive sustainable agriculture. From responsibly raised meat to local and organic produce, the company has crafted a supply chain carefully over decades. Every company is facing supply chain challenges. Chipotle has a great infrastructure. They have a sophisticated team. They have relationships with their suppliers, a lot of whom are local. And a lot who have gotten to know Jack Hartung. He's done much more to build those relationships than just sign checks. Within my first year, I was spending time on hog farms, cilantro farms. Believe it or not, I drove a combine, that's the size of this restaurant, to harvest rice, organic rice. And these are things that they had a lasting impression on me because when I would go back to my office and I would be working on spreadsheets of financial analysis, I saw how the hogs were raised. And I saw how they were raised conventionally versus with our farmers. And I'm like, I've got to make sure that our financials and all everything we spend money on needs to be thoughtful so that we can invest in the better way, raising food. It's more expensive to buy this food. I was trying to make sure that the economic model supported investing in this food and not through higher-many prices. Jack is 100% bought into our purpose of cultivating a better world. One of those key planks, this sustainability and doing the right thing for the planning. And as a result, he's all in bored with investing and understanding the implications on the business and then obviously our purpose. We know what matters. We know what matters, not just to our customers, to our crew as well. We do the right things. We do what's right for our people. We do what's right for the farmers. We do what's right for the environment. For the last 20 years at Chipotle, Jack Hartung has made strategic decisions based on what matters, even in times of turmoil and crisis. Looking back, more often than not, it's paid off. So I wanted to know what he sees when he looks ahead. What's the opportunity for Chipotle in the next 10 years that excites you the most? Well, I think the most exciting thing is that we're not even halfway to our potential in the US. So, you know, when I joined a company with a few hundred restaurants and we were talking about a thousand, maybe two thousand. Here we are at three thousand talking about seven. I believe as we approach seven, that number's going to be higher. A lot higher? Well, I don't know how much higher, but for sure it's going to go up. And international, we're just scratching the surface. And we've been very responsible in the international where we've taken the same food ethos. We've owned the restaurant so far. And so it's been a very slow, let's make sure we get this right. You know, sometimes you have to go slow before you go fast. And that's kind of been our approach. We've gone slow and now we're positioning ourselves to, I think in the not-too-to-some future, go fast in the international. So those are two things that excite me the most. All right, what's the challenge for the next 10 years that is on your mind the most that maybe and keeps you up at night? People. When we run all of our restaurants like we do today, we have around a hundred thousand employees. As we grow, we're going to need more employees. We promoted 19,000 people last year. 90% of our promotions were in-house. So we always have to be on our game in terms of higher and great people that believe in Chipotle and our purpose today. That have the desire to learn how to cook, learn how to run a business, learn how to lead people. If we do a great job with that, the future only gets brighter. So we're in great shape from the people's standpoint, but that's something that I'll always worry about.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1055,2022-11-20 02:55:47
18442," run a business, learn how to lead people. If we do a great job with that, the future only gets brighter. So we're in great shape from the people's standpoint, but that's something that I'll always worry about. Are we hiring and developing the right people? You don't want to be losing people. If we lose people, then we might have to resort to franchising and it's hard to follow a purpose during tough times, like during a pandemic. It's hard to invest in things like food and people. You win margins or under pressure. When you own your own restaurants, you can make those investments. How do you see your role as CFO changing in the next 10 years? Save to say it's changed a lot in the past 10 years. How about the next 10? It has. I think it'll just evolve with the challenges. I mean, again, I'm already fortunate that I've been able to get involved in real estate and supply chain. I spend time in a restaurant, spend time in suppliers, spend time in international as well. So I already get to spend a lot of time in a lot of these areas. I think in terms of evolution, it's probably more a matter of the folks on my team, some of which are new to Chipotle in last few years, some of which have been with us for a long time, to help them rise up so they can take on bigger responsibilities. As we become a bigger company, everybody in the company will need to step up and take on bigger responsibilities. So my main goal will be to make sure that they're ready to take those on. What's the skill set that you think every CFO should be acquiring in this environment? I think being a digital savvy is probably the most important thing. Trying to stay, you know, keep up or even stay ahead of where technology is going, not just in the next five years, the next 10 or 15 years. I think that's the most critical for CFO. What's the best advice for the future that you give to somebody a person who just got promoted to CFO today? I would say be really, really curious. Try to learn as much as you can about every part of the business. Every CFO knows how to read financial statements and go through what a CFO is supposed to do. But I think what you have to do is put those aside at some point, go spend time in your business. In our case, spend time in restaurants, spend time with suppliers. I think get to know how other people within the business, what their challenges are, what their opportunities are, what really makes the customer care about your brand or your business. And I think the more you do that, when you go back to the spreadsheets, you're going to be thinking about things from a different standpoint. Your priorities might change a little bit. Right. And it might change how you make investments to make sure that the customer experience is better next time, rather than the margin is better. I mean, if you invest in the customer in a way where they become loyal to your customer, the margin will come. Hard felt and hands on, Jack Hartung is put Chipotle in position to go forward by always making sure the business goes back to the start and stays true to its roots.

We immigrated to Illinois, Champaign, or Banna. My dad got his degree at the University of Illinois. My mom put food on the table by working three jobs a day. One of which did happen to be in a Chinese restaurant where I moonlight it as a dishwasher. So I got to hang out with mom that way as a way of growing up. And I did that. I mowed lawns.

One, looking backwards, it's just that you have to work to actually get things done. I didn't understand what it meant to live off of food stamps to buy groceries or free and reduced lunch every day inside school. But it was a very empowering feeling to buy my own Nintendo or earn my way to buy my first Apple computer. The second thing was really just the power of independent thinking. My parents, because they were so busy, just trying to make a life for our family, that I was largely left alone. So I grew up playing basketball, watching TV. That's how I learned English. I grew up moving around a lot as a kid. And as a result, I think that gave me a lot of time to realize that it's pretty important to think for yourself. So you studied engineering at Berkeley. Went to business school at Stanford. And you actually started out as an intern at Square. I did. I can't tell you how many people have said to me, Tony Shoe was my intern. That's where. Like, that's how long I've been doing this and how, you know, DoorDash just kind of came out of nowhere. Yeah, I, you know, it was actually a pretty stiff competition between finishing school, Jack Dorsey and Keith Reward, trying to convince me to leave Stanford and work at Square full time. It was a fun and busy period of my time, but I enjoyed both. So how did the idea for DoorDash come about and the decision to not work for, you know, Jack Dorsey in Square, which I'm sure was also kind of intoxicating, right? The idea for DoorDash really came from this, you know, lifelong interest in helping these physical business owners, really people like my mom. So we talked to hundreds of small business owners. And it was surprising to us that even in 2013, delivery was not a solved problem. There were business owners who would show us literally booklets of delivery orders that they would refuse. I mean, we're talking about thousands of dollars per week, which is, you know, the difference sometimes between making payroll and actually, you know, surviving. And they would just turn them down because they were delivery orders, which to us was a really novel and unfortunate phenomenon. And frankly, a necessary one. And that really became, you know, the impetus to start DoorDash. You started out driving for competitors, right? I was driving for a lot of different services to try to actually understand, you know, logistics. You know, my background, as you mentioned, more in engineering math, I thought I was going to be a cancer researcher. I mean, that's pretty much what I spent all of my undergraduate days at Berkeley doing. That kind of 180ed into a world of business. But and so I think it's really important to really learn things for yourself, you know, to think from first principles. Kind of, you know, again, back to that independent thinking, mindset I talked about as a child growing up. Did you try for Uber or Lyft? I even drove for, you know, services that were a little bit older. You know, services like FedEx or Domino's and really try to explore, you know, how does delivery work? And it was really trying to understand, you know, every component part. I mean, it sounds really simple, right? Bring you a burrito from point A to point B, but there were actually 20 steps involved in that delivery. It just didn't appear as obvious to the, you know, naked eyes of the first two years of DoorDash's life. We did deliveries almost every single day. So where did you go from there? I mean, I mean, I mean, early days I know Elon Musk has said starting a company is like swallowing glass and staring into the abyss of death. One of the first ones came actually as early as month three of the company's life. So we were maybe 11 weeks, 12 weeks old as a company. There was a big Stanford football game in September. And, you know, long story short, we were late on every single order. And we had no ability to turn off the site. So it was just horrendous. Everyone in the company, all 12 of us were delivering. And everyone, you know, rightfully so, was furious because of how late we were. And so we had a decision to make, you know, do we do the right thing and refund, you know, every single customer, which would have cost us about 40% of our bank account? Or do we, you know, do a less right and survive another day? Because it was very hard for us at that time to raise capital, which, you know, was something true for DoorDash's early history. And, you know, it took us about 30 seconds to click, submit, refund. And, you know, the lesson for us always is a founding team. And, frankly, even today, as a company, is we'd rather die chasing excellence than live to be mediocre. It wasn't so obvious either in the earlier years. I remember in 2016, you did it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1058,2022-11-20 03:08:50
18445," I think even today as a company is we'd rather die chasing excellence than live to be mediocre. It wasn't so obvious either in the earlier years. I remember in 2016 you did a down-round. I think you actually came on the show around that time. How did you weather the doubters and the people who didn't believe? There were about a thousand days in the desert between 2016, 2017 and 2018. Sometimes with company building, so long as you can convince yourself because time is your most precious resource, you should keep going. If you can keep going long enough, you might get lucky enough to make it. So over time, how did you balance quality with the need and desire to scale and then scale globally? In these types of businesses where it's low margin, high complexity, you really have to figure out what your unit of business is. For us that was a city. So in order to, before going to 7,000 or 10,000 cities globally, we made one city work. And after city one worked, we made city two work. And after we started getting higher and higher confidence that we can make baskets of cities work irrespective of the geographies or what, you know, the customer situation looked like or what the merchant makeup was, then we gained the confidence to actually roll out everywhere. Then came the pandemic. Brian Chesky has said the pandemic was like a torpedo for Airbnb. Was it like the opposite for DoorDash? It was like the biggest wave behind her back, which had the ability to break us. And it almost did because we grew two X in two weeks. We went from a singular US restaurant delivery business. That's what you and I would be talking about in 2019. To today, five businesses in 27 countries, much more than just restaurants. And so all of that was created in the last two years. The big question is how much do customers keep ordering out in a high inflation environment? We will never break. We will never break. Build on a foundation strong enough to stay. We will never break. Have a wide array of things and the mountains shake. All of who will remain. We will never go. We will never go.

DoorDash went public, middle of the pandemic. And I remember actually you were coming on Bloomberg and the price doubled at the open. You were coming out of terrible economic times, the depths of the pandemic. What did that feel like when you are going out into the world starting to sell to public investors and the price just doubles? It was exciting. It was the first time that our company went public. The first time that I had ever undergone any of those experiences before. But in the back of my head it was saying you are never as good or as bad as they say before. And so just remember that. So tease that out for me a little bit because the big question is how much do customers keep ordering out in a high inflation environment? How much long term sustainability and growth is there really? And though COVID is now effectively sustained.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1059,2022-11-20 03:13:00
18446," Inflation environment, how much long-term sustainability and growth is there really? Even though COVID is now effectively sustained and we understand how to live with it, customers are continuing to order. That joinister in the pandemic, they're still ordering out about the same rates as those who joined us before the pandemic. And that's because eating out and getting things delivered are pretty complimentary. On the second point around inflation, I can say that in the last 60 years in looking at the data, spend in restaurants and in grocery have only declined in two of those 60 years, including high inflationary times much higher than what we observed today. And so what I think I take, you know, solace in, even though I see the fact that there is high inflation, is that customers are going to continue spending on food. And our job is to bring greater and greater affordability. More broadly, the economy isn't a tough position. Your competitors have announced layoffs and hiring freezes and slowdowns. Is DoorDash considering any of these? I think we've been fortunate mostly because most of our investments that happened during the pandemic really were meant to build new businesses. And those new businesses have continued to grow. New business is, you know, beyond restaurants and categories like grocery convenience or retail. New businesses overseas, you know, we announced a large acquisition in Volt where that really helped double our overall addressable market to 700 million people. New businesses in building an advertising business, new businesses expanding our services and building a platform to help businesses build their own digital operations. Do you see DoorDash as more of a super app of the future or is it something different? Well, I see DoorDash as really solving two problems. You know, problem one is how do we bring incremental demand to all the physical businesses as they kind of figure out their own digital inhouse capabilities. And the second problem we're trying to solve is bring tools to these businesses. There's still a lot of competition and delivery. Who do you think survives the delivery wars? Who doesn't and why? Well, delivery is a scale economy's game. You know, at the end of the day, you can survive even doing deliveries from a singular story. You know, there's still mom and pop pizza shops and Chinese restaurants that do their own delivery. Do you see DoorDash as a challenger to like Walmart, Amazon? Well, I see DoorDash, you know, as a champion of local businesses and physical businesses. I don't think that a world in which we just get what we want to buy or consume for a few places is a world that again is as worth enjoying living in. It's for our job is to make sure that all of these businesses, all of the millions of physical businesses globally can continue to compete. I do a lot of DoorDash, helps me be a working mom. Whenever I interview you, I get pings from dashers and some of them say they don't get paid enough. Some of them seem pretty angry. What's your response to them? We want the local economy to grow and to thrive. That includes dashers. We have three million dashers that come to the platform every single quarter. And so it's really important to me what they say. In fact, why the company, myself included, we still dash due deliveries in other words once a month. You still do deal for each once a month? It's why we have a dasher community council that we started three, four years ago now. I want to see one of your memos after a delivery. Are you like sending notes to set hands? I'm texting. You know, it's not even after the delivery. I'm texting, you know, not texting while I'm driving, but texting after I complete the order. From your deliveries, what have you learned? Everything. All of the details, everything from, you know, pay considerations, everything from operations at a store, you know, which stores are a bit faster in their operations or more consistent, which stores are less consistent. We already find the last parking space in downtown San Francisco. All of these details matter. They matter for efficiency. They matter for driver pay. They matter for merchant earnings. And so as a result, you know, what I say to dashers is please continue to talk to me. I'm just Tony at DoorDash. And we're always trying to, you know, make things better. We're not saying that we're perfect. But when we look at, you know, the data that we've collected, you know, the average dashers making $24.25 an hour nationwide when they're on when they're doing deliveries. And so and most dashers are pretty satisfied. So DoorDash has been expanding internationally. Sounds like you're on the road a lot.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1060,2022-11-20 03:17:27
18447," when they're on when they're doing deliveries. And so and and most dashers are pretty satisfied. So Dordash has been expanding internationally. Sounds like you're on the road a lot. I'm on the road. I am on the road. US, Canada, Australia, Japan, where else? Where next? Germany, you know, Israel, Finland, a lot of the Nordics. So we're in 27 countries. And a lot of that is is run by, you know, the VULT team that we were lucky to partner with. Beyond VULT, how are you thinking about M&A? Are there any verticals or areas in particular where you might be interested in acquiring? You know, we have five businesses, the US restaurants business, the new categories business with a focus on convenience and grocery. Non-US international 27 countries are B2B business and are ads business. So we have quite a full plate. On M&A specifically, it's a high bar. M&A I think sometimes looks a lot better on paper than can be achieved in reality. And I think it's because you're talking about, at the end of the day, combining human organizations, not just businesses or products or lines on a spreadsheet. I think you have to deliver upon that promise. And so for us, the bar isn't just, does it add to our business, but does it actually add to our culture? You've been piloting rapid delivery, right? Rapid delivery, but rapid delivery seems to be contracting. What are you seeing in your pilots? Is this somewhere you think you'll expand or no? So I think customers are always going to have expectations that go in one direction, right? I don't think we're going to want things delivered more slowly over time or at higher prices or with less selection. Our core use case right now is lunch and dinner, which is highly repetitive, highly profitable, which allows us to invest in things like fast deliveries. I take that with great pride. I also take it with great responsibility. Remembering to invest in those who maybe don't come from privileged backgrounds. 3 Brazil's Somethingинуote to my friends and family something!!) Boyze directed' myself to set myself in a huge You bought Chow Botics last year, but shut it down. This is Robotics, Robotics' kiosks, right? I'm curious how you're thinking about AI and, you know, Uber shut down itself driving stuff and they've started it back up. How are you thinking about AI and moonshots and some of this, you know, potential new technology and how it could help DoorDash or not? Like, is it just not ready for prime time? When it comes to platform shifts or new technologies, AI, autonomy, you know, other types of technologies, I tend to like to make the investment. I think that's a more appropriate choice to not miss the shift. However, I think it's very important to get the pacing right. I still think that the merits behind what, you know, we were trying to do in partnership with the Chow Botics team was the right idea in which we can help restaurants effectively build, you know, a cheaper cost product. That's ultimately what we were trying to do, but we weren't ready yet with the technology. You recently joined Meta's board. What's it like working with Mark Zuckerberg? It's been fantastic, you know, it's been a terrific learning.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1061,2022-11-20 03:22:02
18448," Ready yet with the technology. You recently joined Meta's board. What's it like working with Mark Zuckerberg? It's been fantastic. It's been a terrific learning experience. Learning from Mark all the way to the incredible management team at that company. It has a broad mandate of different products and as well as initiatives. And it's been a privilege. Facebook isn't a very controversial platform. There's controversy about whether Facebook is really good for the world. Whether Facebook should have as much power as it should. How do you think about that? And how are you advising Mark about how do you use that power? With great power comes great responsibility. And I think Facebook has a lot of influence. And Meta's different properties as I'm sure you cover serve billions of people every single day. And that's an enormous privilege and an enormous responsibility that they take incredibly seriously. Like should any company be more powerful than multiple governments combined? I don't think I see it exactly that way, right? Because it's still a contract between the company and its users. I think what's important for Meta to do and they're doing this absolutely is how do we set the guard rails to make it fair, safe for everyone? And this is very, very, very difficult. You're also an investor. I'm a member of different startups. One of them is Alchemy, Web3 company. Yes. Any plans to accept crypto? Any plans for DoorDash to accept crypto? Crypto right now is going through a period where it's trying to figure out what's next in terms of its use case. I think everyone, myself included, very bullish on the technology of what the blockchain enables. What do you think could be the future of blockchain technology in food delivery, in delivery, in general? Well, I don't know if it's going to get applied directly to food or to delivery. I mean, I think it absolutely has the potential to create a new economic infrastructure, right? An economic infrastructure that can really serve as the basis for new banking systems, and et cetera. And so I think that's something more that's tangential to the world of delivery. Obviously, payments is one part of what we do, but it's not the central thing. So we're going to do a little rapid fire now, a little quicker, fun questions, favorite food. I've ordered from 1,100 different DoorDash restaurants. Wow. So I actually like to try everything. Your business idle. There are people in retail that have admired. The people that founded everything from Walmart to Costco. The team at Amazon, in e-commerce. The team Elon Musk and what he's trying to do. What about Elon Musk by Twitter? If he has time to run a third company, I think that'd be fantastic for the world. You grew up in Illinois. You live in California. You like basketball. You're here. Basketball. Favorite game. Bulls. Bulls. Bulls. Bulls. Bulls. Bulls. Bulls. Bulls. Bulls. Bulls. Bulls. Bulls. Bulls. Bulls. Bulls. Bulls. Bulls. Bulls. Bulls. Bulls. Bulls. Bulls. Bulls. Bulls. I think that's been a big lesson. I think the second one is the power of curiosity. Kids, especially in my kids at their ages of two and four are asking the question, why a lot? And I think it's the best question. It's also so hard. And it's so hard to answer because it requires clarity of thinking on everything, on the most basic things to more complicated things. How has being an Asian-American CEO impacted your experience? Well, I think being an Asian growing up is where I was the only Asian, and that was my experience.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1062,2022-11-20 03:26:39
18449," to EO impacted your experience? Well, I think being an Asian growing up where I was the only Asian, and that was kind of my experience in Illinois, certainly had a big experience, and where it very directly, you know, I saw firsthand, you know, whether it was bullying or discrimination, but I think if I were to more broadly classify that to the privileged position that I'm in today, I'm still a minority in the sense that there aren't as many Asian American CEOs or founders as maybe founders from other backgrounds, and so I think it's that reminder to, you know, one always recognize that, and then I think secondly to always keep the underdog mentality. Do you think you faced more challenges than others because Asian American CEOs are so underrepresented? I mean, Asian Americans are underrepresented in leadership roles in tech, full stop. I can't say that, you know, for me personally, in building DoorDash, was that the experience? But look, I think you're writing calling out that when I look around me, and when I look at especially public company, founders CEOs, well, hey, there aren't that many, B, when you start filtering for, you know, those from Asian descent, it's a much, much smaller list. And so I take that with, you know, great pride. I also take it with great responsibility. And really, and again, remembering to invest in those who maybe don't come from privileged backgrounds, giving them an equal shot at it and to always to stay so hungry. You change your name to Tony when you moved? Well, that's five, yeah. To the US, you're five years old, after Tony Danza, who was the star of who's the boss. Correct. I love that. I did. You know, no one could pronounce my Chinese name, and so I said, okay, well, let's just make it easier. Yeah. Well, I walked with my dad to the immigration office and legally changed my name. Did life change, did it feel like life changed after that? It felt a lot easier to say, hi, I'm Tony. What's it like being the boss now? Honestly, I think, I don't see myself that way. And I recognize that that's probably not how others view me, but I really view myself as a teammate. And, you know, for me, I think it's trying to make that actually true, make the reality of how I feel, true to the perception that maybe others have of me as the boss and making that distance shorter and shorter.

And when clean energy advocates think about what can we find, it would be as easy to use as fossil fuels they think about hydrogen. The fuel that will, when burned, only produce water. We like to imagine that if we just built enough of these and these, we could ditch fossil fuels and save the planet. Unfortunately, it's not that simple. There are some things where you just need a good old-fashioned combustible fuel. Now startups around the world are betting that hydrogen can become the fuel of the 21st century.

Thank you Andy so much for coming down. It's really wonderful to have you here in person. It's my pleasure to be here. Thanks for having me. I just found out we actually lived in the same dorm in college just a few years apart. So it's been almost a year since you took over from Jeff as CEO of Amazon. And it's been a year of first, the first stock split since the.com boom. The first vote to unionize an Amazon warehouse, your first Bloomberg technology conference. Thank you. I want to start with a quick report card. In February 2021, Jeff Bezos shocked the world by announcing plans to step down as Amazon CEO. A few months later, he passed the reins to Andy Jassy, his longtime top lieutenant, the architect of one of the company's biggest profit engines, Amazon Web Services. Bezos has stayed on as executive chair, leaving Jassy to navigate a critical inflection point in Amazon's history. How does the company manage market turmoil, rising inflation and regulatory scrutiny, and a push by some warehouse workers to unionize all while keeping customers coming back? Joining me on this edition of Bloomberg Studio 1.0, Amazon's second CEO, Andy Jassy, he joined us from our flagship Bloomberg technology summit in San Francisco. I'd like you to grade your view of Amazon's performance. And we've got time later to really dig in. But quickly, how would you grade Amazon's performance over the last year with customers? Well, I think we, you know, I'm not sure I'm the right person to grade myself during the year or not. But I'll give you my take, you know, I think with respect to customers, I think we've done a lot of good, you know, and I think if you look at during the pandemic, which really has extended till the early part of this year, you know, so much of the PPE and food and essential items and people equipping their home offices were bought from Amazon and, you know, to scale the way we needed to remember, in 2020, we grew 39% year over year on a $245 billion revenue run. I mean, it's unprecedented. It's never happened before. But it was really hard to do that. And we had to take the really big footprint of the fulfillment center footprint. We built the first 25 years of Amazon and doubled it in 24 months. We built out that transportation network in just a couple of years. You know, we nearly doubled the size of our workforce during that time. And I think you saw it in other businesses. AWS is a really big part of helping companies and governments have business continuity during the pandemic. And so many companies and organizations in the last year made the strategic decision that they were going to stop running their own infrastructure technology and disproportionately chose AWS to help them move to the cloud.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1064,2022-11-20 03:34:42
18451," These organizations in the last year made the strategic decision that they were going to stop running their own infrastructure technology and disproportionately chose AWS to help them move to the cloud and we spent a lot of time helping to make that transformation. So what about investors? I mean, the stock is down significantly from a peak last year. Obviously, there's broader market turmoil. Yeah, I think, you know, for investors financially, I'd say it's mixed. You know, I think we have some businesses that are growing really strongly. If you look at AWS in 2021, grew 37 percent year-over-year. It's not a $74 billion revenue run rate business. It's pretty unusual growth. And we grew 58 percent year-over-year in our advertising business, you know, it's a $32 billion revenue run rate business. So some businesses are growing really strongly. And, you know, we've continued to grow in our retail business despite pretty crazy comparable during 2020. But I think the real challenge for us there is on the cost side. And there have been several things that have happened. Some of which are more controllable than others. You know, I think the part that's less controllable is really around inflation. And I think we thought that inflation would start to attenuate in 2022. And with the war in Ukraine, it just went the other way and has significantly accelerated. And so the cost of trucking and line haul and ocean and air and fuel has just substantially gone up. And I think that will attenuate at some point. No one knows how long that will take. I think the more controllable areas for us are really around fulfillment center capacity and productivity. It was taking about 24 months to build new fulfillment centers during the pandemic. And so we had to make decisions, you know, in mid-2020 and early 2021 on how much demand we were going to plant for. And so, you know, we end up with more capacity than we need right now. And there's a number of things that we're working on. We've stopped building on properties where we don't need it yet. And we've let a number of leases lapse and not a small number, you know, of both those things. We've had a lot of occasions in our history where we've worked on productivity and made improvements. And we have a lot of clearly defined issues. And I'm confident we're going to get back to the right level of profitability. You are going to sub-lease 30 million square feet of space. Is there a mistake in the execution there because of the overbuilding? Again, because you have to make these decisions two years in advance. Again, if you put yourself back in 2020 where we were growing 39% year over year on a 245 billion dollar revenue run rate, it's very hard to know what's the right amount to build and you have to make a decision. And we made the decision to err on the side of our consumers and sellers. Now, how would you grade Amazon's performance with employees, your colleagues? There has been some high profile. Yeah. I think that when I started in this gig, we had just created a new leadership principle to strive to be Earth's best employer. And I think we're, you know, we spent a lot of time trying to think through what that really means is broad. And I think we've made a fair bit of progress, but it's still early, in my opinion. But I still think there are many areas that we can keep improving. I think, you know, the first one I'd mention is safety. You know, I think that, you know, in our fulfillment centers, that is the top priority. And, you know, when you get into the details and numbers and outside of all the spin of it all, you know, we're about average there, but we're not trying to be average. You know, we want to be the best in the industry and the best in the world at it. And that's a high priority and an area that I'm passionate about and the team is passionate about. We have a lot of work we can do to make our employees everyday lives easier. We have, we've identified kind of a top 100 list of areas that we can be better at that we're just metronomically stepping through. And so we've made a lot of progress, but we've a lot of work to you still. Elam must just came out saying he has a super bad feeling about the economy, Tesla laying off 10% of his staff. Jamie Dimon says he's preparing for an economic hurricane. The World Bank just slashed its forecast for global growth. How do you feel about the economic climate? Well, I wasn't planning on giving any guidance to the camera. Please. But, super bad or super super bad. I think there are some things that are related to Amazon that are useful to remember. I think the first piece is remember that 85% of the worldwide retail market segment share is offline.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1065,2022-11-20 03:39:07
18452," I think the first piece is remember that 85% of the worldwide retail market segment share is offline. And if you believe that that equation is going to flip at some point, which we do, I think it will flip over a long period of time. If you look at different downturns, should we have one at some point? And we've been through a few, obviously, in the 25 years that I've been at Amazon, customers changed their habits. And so I also think there's, those two reasons, those two factors give me some optimism that even if we have a downturn, that we have the potential to still grow. We have a roadmap that's probably three to five years long. And we're going to continue to invent, we're going to continue to be insurgent. And we have a lot of work to do to get to where we think we ultimately can get for customers. Now, when it comes to the stock, as I mentioned, it has fallen significantly. Do you think investors are missing something or has tech just been overvalued? And this also, of course, matters to employees who are significantly paid in stock? Well, you know, look, I haven't been at Amazon for 25 years. I arrived at the company three weeks before we went public. I have never tried to predict what the stock's going to do. And any time I've tried to a little bit, I've been wrong. So, you know, I think it's a pretty hard to predict what's going to be in any short period of time. I do really believe that Benjamin Graham, Max, in the short term, the stock market tends to be a voting machine and the long term tends to be a waiting machine. And I think if you, you know, we've been through a lot of points in 25 years at Amazon, where the macro factors are off and stocks are down. Our stock is down. But you can't really control that. We have a concept we talk about a lot of Amazon inputs and outputs. You know, the ultimate output for a company is share price. You know, and then other big outputs are free cash flow or profit or revenue. You can't really manage the outputs. You have to manage at the input level. And that's where we spend all our time. And so, if you do the right things for the business long term, things tend to work out. I think we've had very good returns for investors. And I expect that to be true again. Do you see Amazon strategy as fundamentally different from Netflix and Disney and if so how? Lots happening on Wall Street. I'm quite encouraged. The center is holding. Need to catch up. This is Bloomberg Wall Street week. I'm David Weston. We've got the information and insight. A lot of these areas still have very, very good valuations. From businesses most influential and instrumental. It's knocking it out the bolt, though. It's not a great time to be speculative. It's time for a pivot. We're talking about a significant hit to our standard of living. Bloomberg Wall Street week. A lot of the satellites have propulsion systems that can kind of move to get out of the way of each other or change their orbit a little bit. Companies have been doing that for decades moving satellites around, but it's sort of like a harder problem now. The risk of a collision is a lot higher now. Just because we've installed so much more hardware into space, you have a big collision. It creates a cloud of debris. And now all the other satellites are flying through this whizzing mess of debris as we add all of the new satellites into space. The risk of a collision, the likelihood of the collision is going up. What are the moon shots at Amazon that are capturing most of your time and attention? What is going to define the next era of Amazon? I mean, is it Astro, the home row butter? Is it something else? Well, you know, we have a unique way that we look at big new investments. And I'm not sure it's right or wrong. It just happens to be our way. And we ask ourselves when we're considering something for questions. We ask if it's successful, can it be.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1066,2022-11-20 03:43:24
18453," It just happens to be our way. And we ask ourselves when we're considering something, four questions. We ask, if it's successful, can it be big and move the needle in Amazon? Is it being well served today? Do we have a differentiated approach? And do we have confidence there? And if not, can we acquire quickly? And if we like the answer to those questions, we'll go pursue it with a single-threaded team that isn't distracted by the rest of the business. And sometimes that leads to innovation and investments that seem pretty obvious. Like when I got to that company, it was a book's only retailer. And then we expanded to music and video electronics and toys. It seemed obvious to people. Other times, that process does not lead to investments that seem obvious to people. I mean, AWS was something that people externally and internally thought was a little bit nutty at the time. But just imagine what Amazon would be today without AWS. And I think that you see the same thing here. There are so many significant investments we're making that I'm excited about. I'm going to have to constrain myself to a few. But I'm really excited about what we're doing in the prime video space. I think we're clearly on the right track there and building a significant business. That's interesting, because Netflix also just announced some layoffs. The first subscriber loss in a decade, Disney cutting back on costs. Do you see Amazon's strategy as fundamentally different from Netflix and Disney? And if so, how? I know we're very bullish on it. Remember, all the models are a little bit different. But for prime video, we have 200 million plus prime subscribers who get that entertainment for free by being part of prime. And so we have a little bit different pricing model than some of the others. But I'm incredibly encouraged by what we have coming. If you look, I mean, we launched this show for a reacher earlier in the year, it was a huge hit. We have a new Maisel season. We just launched the new Boys season, which is a big one. Are you a May Boys fan? I am a big boys fan. It's very good. Of course, we have one of the rings coming up in September and Thursday at football. So I'm very bullish about it. We also here, we're excited about what we've done with MGM. I think some of the assets there will go very well with the rest of what we're doing entertainment-wise. So if you look at Warner Brothers Discovery and Paramount and Stars and Global, they're building really significant subscription businesses. So I'm very bullish about that business. I'm optimistic that we have a chance to build a significant grocery business, which is early stages for us. I am excited about Kuiper, which is our low-Earth orbit, satellite that we're building. You've got to remember there are 300 to 400 million people in the world who have limited to no internet connectivity. I mean, just think about how different the world is when you don't have that type of connectivity. And so I think that's a really significant opportunity that has some AWS characteristics to it. I continue to be very optimistic about Alexa. You're building the world's best personal assistant. We have 200 million endpoints already that are using Alexa. We're clearly onto something there. And then our autonomous driving, ride-hailing service and zoos that we're building here in Bay Area. I just think with the way auto consumption is evolving, I think that also is a chance to be really significant business. Now, I don't know if all of them are going to be successful, but if any one of them becomes the fourth pillar for us on top of marketplace and prime and AWS, we're a completely different company. Just like we were when AWS became successful. So I think they're very worthwhile investments and bets and I'm optimistic about them. We didn't mention Astro, obviously, though, powered by Alexa. You're going to be a good example, yeah. But I mean, our home robot's going to be a good example. We don't yet. Where is it? It's not really widely available for sale. What's the status? I hope you get one. OK. Thank you. Everyone's very curious about Jeff's role these days. What kind of executive chair he really is. He said when he left that he'd focus his attention and energies on initiatives that he really cares about as Ed Amazon, but from the outside, it looks like he's really focusing on philanthropy. He's focusing on space. What kind of an executive chairmen is he? Well, Jeff is always going to be involved. And I feel very lucky to have been in Amazon for 25 years. I feel very lucky to have worked directly for Jeff for 20 of them. And we have a really close relationship and have for a long time.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1067,2022-11-20 03:47:50
18454," Very lucky to have been in Amazon for 25 years. I feel very lucky to have worked directly for Jeff for 20 of them. And we have a really close relationship and have for a long time. And I think we share a lot of the same values about customers and how important it is to optimize for customers and how high standards they need to be given how easy it is for people to switch and the importance of invention and speed. And so I just feel very lucky to have had the chance to work so closely with them. So is your relationship, I mean, he was your only boss for 25 years, right? Is your relationship fundamentally different than it was when you were the head of innovation? Yeah, of course. Every single job you have, the relationship's different. Remember, the first couple years I worked for Jeff, I worked as what we call the shadow then, which is really like a chief of staff. And that was different than when I was starting AWS, which was different from when we got AWS going. And it was a business that was starting to do well. And it's different when I'm in the CEO role. But the constant has always been that we have a great relationship and we collaborate really well. Amazon is poised to become the biggest private sector employer in the world. Second, right now Walmart is in that spot. But Amazon will probably soon surpass it. First vote to unionize at an Amazon warehouse. I know you've been spending a lot of time at warehouses. When you look at someone like Chris Smalls, who I think some people look at as this modern day hero who got fired, pulled off this union vote, what's your message to someone like him? Your message to the folks who think, maybe we should join a union? Well, I think that the first thing to be clear about is that employees get to make that choice, whether they want to have a union or not. They always have had that choice and it continues to be their choice. And we happen to think they're better off without a union for a number of reasons, including the fact that, it's much harder when you have a union to have a direct relationship with your manager and to get things done quickly. So if you see something on the line that you think could be better for your team or you or your customers, you can't just go to your manager and say, let's change this. There's a whole process in bureaucracy that you have to go through to be able to do that. And when there's a union, we're going to get the feedback filtered by what the union decides is worth bringing up. And we'd much rather hear from every employee whatever is on their mind. And so I think if you want to continue to have the structure that we've had for all this time, you have to have really competitive benefits. And then I think if you look at Amazon's, they're very unusual in this space. We championed the $15 minimum wage several years ago. The starting salary is now over $18 an hour, which is more than double the federal minimum wage. You get full health insurance and 401K and up to 20 weeks of parental leave. And if you want to get a college education, you haven't had one. We have a career choice program that lets our fulfillment center associate be able to do so. That is a very unusual and compelling set of benefits. And those were all accomplished without a union. So I think that we realize that we have to continue to work on the relationship with our employees. And we need to continue to provide the right benefits. And we need to continue to work on safety. And that's our intention. You made a huge mark on Amazon with AWS, obviously. What is the mark that you want to make still? No one covers the world like Bloomberg. My team thinks 2023. We avoid a recession. I'm a little more skeptical about that. China and the US both do not want to see nuclear force in the European continent. The regulators here in the Bahamas are ongoing with their investigation into ATIAC. With unmatched reach in resources from more than 120 countries, the moment news breaks 24 hours a day. Bloomberg, your global business authority. Stalked early enough all these precious materials. You were just mentioning. And we were on the lucky side that our prognosis was spot on in a way, forecasting what kind of material we would need and what quantity we would need.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1068,2022-11-20 03:52:02
18455," On the lucky side that our prognosis was spot on in a way, forecasting what kind of material we would need and what quantity we would need. The FTC has revamped its antitrust inquiry into Amazon and by some accounts is accelerating it. Are you preparing for an antitrust lawsuit from the FTC? If you are a large company that is growing to a significant extent like we have, you have to be prepared to be scrutinized and we have known this for some time, many years, and we have tried to run the company with that in mind and knowing that if somebody looked that we would stand up to that scrutiny. I think that is what we have tried to do in running the business. We cannot control whether organizations bring different suits against us. I think if you look at our business, if you actually look at the fact, if you take out of the equation that there may not be the most objective leadership when it comes to Amazon in that organization, if you look at the facts in our retail business, we are about 1% of the worldwide retail market segment share. Remember, 85% of us is still offline. If you look at our AWS business, depending on your measure, 95% of the worldwide global IT spend is on premises. We have a cloud business and then we have a portion of the leading market segment share in the cloud part of this. We operate, who we compete with, AWS is really on premises, IT in addition to the cloud. We have a lot of small percentages of the entire pie and you can kind of step through all the businesses. I think simply because you have been successful in a few different businesses doesn't somehow mean that you have unnatural market power. It just means you have been successful in a couple of different customer experiences. But we still have a relatively small amount of market segment share in those areas. What about the SEC or being sued by them over third party data and how you used it? Do you think in the past Amazon made mistakes with letting employees internally see how those third party sellers were doing? We have pretty good control. We of course disagree with the premise of that. But I would say that we have very good controls with respect to the data that the different employees sets are able to see. By the way, I think that we can be better for sellers. We can have better tools from the get started. We can have better tools from the manage what they're doing across their different Amazon units. I think we can communicate better. There's a whole bunch of things we can do better. We agonize over every single email or communication we get from sellers. We do very regularly robust surveying and a lot more sellers are happy with Amazon than unhappy with Amazon. I think if you look at what they're able to do as a business by virtue of selling on Amazon versus not, it completely changes what's possible. Sellers don't really long for e-commerce software. That exists in lots of places. What they love about selling on Amazon is that they get access to hundreds of millions of customers. That completely changes what their prospects can be in terms of the business as they're building. We have a lot of work to do there. We do in a lot of other places. I think we have a very strong partnership with sellers. What's the view of the supply chain right now and how much pain there is going to continue to be and for how long? I think there's a lot of challenges in the supply chain still. It's gotten better than it was. There are all sorts of challenges. Non-parasurable goods, electronics, chips are still a significant issue for all sorts of businesses.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1069,2022-11-20 03:56:17
18456," was, but there are all sorts of challenges, non-parasurable goods, electronics, chips, is still a really significant issue for all sorts of businesses. We have worked really hard to open a lot more points of presence and ports and increase our capacity and getting products in, but I think it's going to be something that companies battle with for some time. You made a huge mark on Amazon with AWS, obviously. What is the mark that you want to make still on Amazon? I mean, in this new role, what's going to define the anti-Jacy era? Well, I don't really think of it that way, Emily. I mean, I don't think it's really about an anti-Jacy era or any one person. And by the way, AWS was not about any one person. If you spend a time on AWS, that is an unbelievable team, not just an incredible leadership team, which it is, but just top to bottom. The number of inventors and people care about customers and operate something where it has to work almost like a dial tone. It's always teams. And so I look at every single one of our businesses and take our retail business or our consumer business, which is the oldest for our business is 85% of it still lives offline. I think we have a lot of upside and a lot of growth. And I think as much invention as we've seen the last 25 years, the time I've been there, I think it's going to look small compared to the next 25 years. There is a lot for us to invent on behalf of customers. And so I'm excited to be part of the team that makes that happen. We are continuing to increase the amount that we give back to the communities in which we have a big presence. And that really matters to me. I think we have a responsibility to do that. So it's a long journey that we're working on, but I'm excited to be part of it and I hope it's harder for a long time. Well thank you for joining us and telling us about the way the journey is going so far. Thank you very much. And we appreciate it. You're welcome. Thank you very much.

We don't trust them to self-regulate when it comes to workplace comp. Why on earth would we trust them to self-regulate AI? Music Welcome everybody to the inaugural NIL Summit and NIL Awards. In July 2022, Atlanta hosted what might sound like a boring legal seminar. A conference on the new rules around name, image, and likeness in sports. But far from dry and academic, the first annual NIL Summit was in fact a flashy star-studded event put on at the College Football Hall of Fame. And mingling amid the biggest current and former names in sports and media, there was a crucial cohort. The player is poised to redefine what it means to be a modern college athlete. And the winner of male athlete of the year goes to Chase Griffin. Among those up-and-comers, UCLA's Chase Griffin. The UCLA quarterback is among the students becoming as well known for making deals as making plays. And even in that group, Chase stands up. My name is Chase Griffin. What's up everyone? It's Chase Griffin. It's your favorite quarterback, it's favorite quarterback, Chase Griffin. When you look at it as an empowerment equity opportunity, it's really been unmatched in the sports world for any point in time since Title IX. Let's go. After hardly a full year of name, image, and likeness deals being the reality, he already has more than 20 deals with major brands, venture and charitable groups. All the while balancing graduating undergrad in just two years and fighting for playing time on the field. Chase Griffin out of the gun. We are joined by UCLA quarterback Chase Griffin, not just UCLA quarterback, but name image likeness superstar. Why am I in sight for this one? This could actually be the president of the United States someday. Chase isn't the starting quarterback for UCLA. He's not even the backup quarterback. But back on campus in LA, his nickname is President Chase. And after spending a couple days talking about his approach to business, sports and equality, it's not shocking to think he might someday hold that office. His level of focus and maturity at the stage, I only wish I had. If you want to buy stock and human being, buy stock and Chase Griffin. When it comes to building generational wealth, it's not about the money that you make in college. I'm very excited that I made the amount of money that I made last year. I am even ten times more excited that I know how to make that money. Summer on any college campuses, mostly for the athlete, tour on lighter, but still regimented schedules. The tendon classes working out, a little bit of hanging out, and then more working out on their own time. Chase is no exception. The 21 year old is a backup, albeit an impatient one.

18458," The 21 year old is a backup, albeit an impatient one. In the Topsy-Turvy past couple of seasons dotted with family games and COVID protocols, he's been able to start three games for the Bruins. Griffin, go to throw to the end zone! Wide open again! Touchdown UCLA! Beating Arizona and narrowly losing to both Stanford and Oregon. That was inches away from Chase Griffin and UCLA by being in full-fledged comeback mode. For Chase, UCLA felt like destiny. He was born just a few miles away before his family moved to Texas when he was a toddler. But beyond being a sort of homecoming, the school's history of athlete activism was a massive draw. I always expected from myself to have some sort of impact that was beneficial for more people than I interact with on a daily basis. And choosing UCLA, a lot of that went into me seeing myself as someone who reflected the same want to make things better, that so many of the people that UCLA pride to self upon be in the home for have done in the past. The legacies of former UCLA greats like Arthur Asch, Jackie Robinson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Jackie Joyner Kursi have had a wide-ranging impact on society well beyond the Westwood campus. Chase reveres these people, but he's perhaps most keenly aware of the activism of a more recent Bruin alum, the basketball player at O'Bannon. At O'Bannon, who was an ace-smith player of the year National Champ, UCLA Sports Legend is also a legal hero. I think NIO could be the next installment where we look back in 30, 40, 50 years and God willing, if we give him the roses he deserves, we add at O'Bannon to that list of UCLA greats. O'Bannon, who played at UCLA from 91 to 95, initiated a lawsuit that's widely credited for finally opening up the possibility of college athletes being paid for use of their name, image and likeness. He sued the NCAA in video game publisher EA for antitrust violations, arguing that athletes should be entitled to financial compensation when schools used their likeness for gain. In 2014, a judge ruled in his favor. I don't think he was congratulating. What was your call? And then, on an episode of the shop, surrounded by O'Bannon, Diana Tarrassi and LeBron James, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed the first ultimately successful legislation to allow athletes to receive endorsement deals. The Fair Pay to Play Act led other states to follow suit and ultimately led the NCAA in 2021 to relent, seemingly reluctantly. NIL payments were officially allowed as of July 1, 2021. Today is the last day where name, image and likeness laws will not be on the books and kids will not be, if you will, not allowed to make money off of their name, image and likeness. Making money from Jersey sales and endorsement deals is a way for players to share in the massively lucrative world of college athletics. This NIL thing is the wild, wild west. The NIL change felt like many things that happened very slowly and then it happened very fast. And I wonder for you, having contemplated that maybe this was coming at some point, how prepared were you, what was your mindset when the switch flipped? Right. I mean, I still think everyone's trying to get prepared for the industry. It's still sort of like a wild, wild west. I wasn't really expecting anything. I was more just thinking about honestly getting ready for that season and capitalizing on everything that was happening. When NIL hit and it turned out I had action, I was like, oh, okay, well after this degree deal, which was fantastic. I was like, okay, I see how I can be a staple in this game and I see how I can get better over time. That's why I teamed up with my friends at Shell. Then Shell deal hit and then boost my whole deal hit. Then you keep on building and clear cover. You keep on building.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1072,2022-11-20 04:09:28
18459," better over time. That's why I teamed up with my friends at Shell. Now in Shell they'll hit and then boost my whole deal hit. Then you keep on building clear coverage. Like you keep on building and you get better in the meetings. And most of all you start seeing where your value can be best placed in these new opportunities. The headlines and storylines in the aftermath of the NIL change introduced visions of instant millionaire strolling campuses across the nation. You might think the NIL athlete of the year lives in Splendor or at least in one of those athletic palaces that put most of our coach dorms to shame. Well, it's all relative to chase. All right Jason. So here we are world headquarters. Yep, this is where it all happens. So there's the kitchen right here. I actually really enjoy cooking. Oh yeah. Yeah, this gas oven gets really hot really fast. I make pizzas in there. And this is the best appliance since dog phone. If I already put anything in there, I need to do these dishes right here. So no trappings of success yet. More a pretty average college dorm room. The fridge filled with leftovers, a well-used PS4. And of course, the requisite godfather poster. It's a far cry from the lifestyles seen in some local news reports for NIL athletes during this first year. Beigeon Robinson made headlines with an NIL deal with Lamborghini Austin. Lamborghini's tend to make more headlines that Muhammad Ali are proucely pictures. Some athletes are living in mansions driving Lamborghinis. As far as I know, you're doing either of those things. I see where you're living right here. It is with all due respect, not a mansion. How much of that is a conscious choice and what does it say about sort of your approach to this? Right, I mean, first I look at this is like, it's my own room, I got everything I need. I'm cool with that. I'm cool with living below my means. I think it's important to remember that the volume of financial gain is completely overstated. And that's what it y'all is for in the media. Yeah. And someone hears about a five million or ten million dollar deal. You gotta report it like, oh my goodness, people are gonna read this. Hey, I'd count two things. Like, how many kids are even getting these deals? And then for the kids that do get it, how much of that is in liquor cash? And how much of it is in assets? If you pay for a two million dollar house out here in LA for a kid to stay in and college, that's great. But as soon as they're graduated, they're not gonna have that two million dollars. I say the same thing, you know, for the kids who are driving around in Lamborghinis and stuff like that. That's awesome. Like, that's super dope. And I know some of those kids. But, you know, someone paying for your lease is different than someone actually giving you the value of that lease every single month, you're investing in saving it for a long K, etc. I say all that just to mention that product deals and stuff like that are overhyped by the media. And they also can land kids in some trouble if they're not paying taxes on it. That's one of the distinctly unsexy and easy to overlook elements of the new rules. Even if an athlete's not getting cold hard cash from a deal, the value of any products given are subject to state and federal taxes. So suddenly, what a player sees as free gear in return for some social media posts actually equals taxable income. And that requires the same forms you'd fill out as an independent contractor getting a check. I made a fair amount in NIL deals and I invested all of it. In my opinion, NIL is great. Doing all this is great. Making money now is great, but the most valuable thing I've gotten from all of this is in the fact I'll always know how to make money off of myself. All told, Chase has done more than 20 deals with major brands like Degree, Shell, and Boost Mobile, along with venture-stage companies including Discord, Duffel, and Creative Juice. He's also made a point to work with charities like the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank, where he's already raised funds for almost 60,000 meals.

Instead of burning oil and gas to give us the energy and electricity we need, we want to do 100% clean energy, all-electric. We want to turn buildings into Tesla's. Just like a Tesla or an electric vehicle is all electric with no fossil fuels. We want to do that with our buildings. And if we can do it in one building, we can do it in all buildings. And if we do it in all buildings, we'll reduce 30% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. BSO Now is your online home for weekly Boston Symphony Orchestra and Boston Pops performances.

At his desk, when he's not making music, another side project, he's either networking with CEOs or investors he seeks out, or who seek him out, or negotiating new deals. This is an average NIL deal. A brand approaches an athlete who can help spread their message to a demographic they believe the athlete can help reach. In this case, direct TV is looking to market their NFL Sunday ticket to college students. It'd be two posts, one post late August and one post on the first week of September. And the compensation would be 1200 per post, so it would be 400 total. Right. Are they video posts or are they picking captions? They can be either. It's up to you guys. That was pretty good. 400 above, but they had originally asked. So that's a win.

If there's any place to learn that sports are deep in the hearts of Americans, it's on a high school football field in Texas. Friday night lights in the Lone Star State might be the great iron equivalent of Frank Sinatra's New York City. Making it there means you're something special. Chase Griffin quarterback class 19, Hotto, Texas. And Chase didn't just make it, he excelled. Let's talk about some of the top quarterbacks in the state. And when you look at that list at the top of it, you got to talk about Chase Griffin. I was lucky to play three years as a quarterback for Hotto High School, which is a one horse town. We have great success. And so the town really shut down and came out and supported us every Friday night. Chase, from the back. And I'm going to say, I'd open a peeking catch tonight. He does touch it on the boat. Chase, one word to describe that finish that game. God, that's it. Coming from a town like that where football is so prioritize, it has its pros and cons, but I think on the pros side, I learned how to win, how to get better. And most importantly, what it's like to build a team where everyone gets better. Emulating his UCLA alumni like Robinson, joiner cursi and Abdelger Bar, Chase is looking at the impact NIL will have not just for him, but the athletes that will follow. When the predecessors who have come before you have changed the world and made life better for everyone today, you can't help but ask yourself how the actions that you're taking now and the companies and brands and the NIL space that you work with are all cumulatively building something greater than any of us could foresee. I've actually, I've never moderated. So this will be my first time. It should be fun. I know my handwriting is terrible. The last day the conference chase was asked to co-moderate a panel with Monique Nelson, the CEO for UNI World Group. All right, I'm excited to be here. UNI World Group is one of the longest standing multi-cultural advertising and marketing agencies in the United States. The firm works with brands like Ford, Home Depot, and Johnson and Johnson to help reach the black and brown communities. And they have big ambitions in NIL. For UNI World Group, the idea of this was pretty epic in that because we serve the undervalued, overlooked, and the underserved, we knew that this particular group of people would fall into that category. And we plan on being the premier practice for NIL athletes that are looking to do purpose-driven media advertising, community level engagement work. UWG launched a program called the NIL to help black student athletes partner with major brands. But to help them understand how to do that, they brought on chase to serve as a student-athlete executive in residence. For me, I do nothing without tremendous amounts of data for all of our clients. I really wanted to be thoughtful about this practice being very athlete-centric. If I were to build it or anyone on my team were to build it, it would not have the athlete at the core. When you're 18, 19, 20, 21, 20, two, the best way to have credibility is confidence and the only way for confidence to be authentic. I'm actually learning on the job. I'm learning about the brand side of NIL, but I'm also trying to make sure that empowerment equity is built in, especially for black student athletes in the NIL world.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1075,2022-11-20 04:22:21
18462," of NIO, but I'm also trying to make sure that empowerment equity is built in, especially for Black student athletes in the NIO world. ROI. Return on investment. Both Chase and UWG see NIO deals as something much more than making money for students. It's also a potential investment in a community long overlooked. Think we're getting ready to stop boxes. I'm gonna feed the people with L.A. A piece of each of Chase's NIO deals go to his belief brand campaign, which has raised more than $13,000 for meals for the L.A. Food Bank backpack program. But athletes giving back is only one side. I'm here with legal zoom to give you five tips on the NIO game plan. UWG and Chase believe having brands investing in the athletes, especially athletes of color, can be a forced multiplier for these historically marginalized communities. When you look at the revenue jet and rating sports for the Bombass, 88% of those athletes are Black. So when you're doing stuff to empower student athletes in the NIO space, you're also helping to deliver on your promise. Now student athletes are not the only ones who should receive this help by any means. But statistically by doing that, you're gonna be delivering on your mission. Additionally, student athletes on average come from lower levels of income. So you're also delivering on that promise. And a lot of these student athletes are first generation, their first gen college students. Some of them first gen high school diploma. Some of them first time receiving the amount of money that they receive in their families. This has been a wild first year in NIO. We all knew that there would be bags of cash around, right? There's always been bags of cash. There's cash everywhere. What we know is that that's not sustainable. We know that athletics has an expiration date on it. So for us, inclusion ultimately means this is just a part of you. It is a tremendous part of you and we are gonna celebrate that part of you. But we also know that you're bigger than that. So we want to empower you to live past your expiration date for this part of your life. And quite honestly have equity in everything that you have poured yourself into as an NIO athlete. It may still be the Wild West days for the NIO industry. But in the first year, about a billion dollars in business was done with NCAA athletes. For the early leaders in the NIO space like Chase, they're striking a precedent for athletes that follow them. And that's important because collegiate athletes don't have that much time to profit. Only an estimated 2% of NCAA athletes go on to the pros. Even the hardest working are often limited by things they can't control. For Chase, it's been his height. I'm 5'10 now in high school after my sophomore year went out through for 3,000 yards. I was probably like 5'6"", 5'5"". I mean, I could already say I'm one of the best in the history of Texas high school football. But, you know, I've gone through the height test where they'll call you out of class, shake your hand, look at you up and down. And be like, nice to meet you, you go back to class. It's a sad but timeless story for student athletes. And for Chase, his story is something he's not shyed away from, but embraced when it comes to his NIO deals. I'm frequently the smallest person on the football field, but I always strive to be the most impactful. My middle school coach told me that I would never play in high school. Chase's deals with degrees breaking limits team and clear covers inspired underdogs, allowed him to capitalize financially from football. Even the last season, he never saw the field for UCLA. I play football because I love the game. I play the football because I'm a good competitor. I love to compete and I play football because I'm good at it. At the end of the day, I don't play football for my livelihood, which is important to remember when it comes down to identity. I myself changed Griffin as long as I'm that. I got something in this world. I see moves into the news.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1076,2022-11-20 04:26:44
18463," Because I'm that, I got something in this world. As he moves into the new season and focuses more on football than business, Chase doesn't seem much of a differentiation between the two in terms of his mindset. I wouldn't be surprised if I wasn't playing football in five years and it was running in Fortune 500 company, but I also wouldn't be surprised if I was winning a Super Bowl five, ten years from now. And either way, I'm gonna keep on working at the tools that would align myself and my future with both. At the end of the day, you're always gonna have yourself. If you can make profit off of yourself and know where you add value in any world you're in, you'll be able to adapt and find ways to generate wealth for yourself. Part of what I love about business is you get to build things from nothing. I don't have any investors. All this is all money in. This is me just building it. It's pretty much full service shadow banking with nobody in charge. We don't have enough women founder CEOs who are getting funding. So basically less than 2% of VC funds go to women, less than 1% go to women of color. And so in this innovation space, I said to myself, what's the best way to use capital to move things for women? And that's when I started to say, OK, I actually need to move some money into the venture capital space. And I want to do it smartly. I mean, the first goal is to make money. I'm not putting my money out as a social impact. I'm putting it out to make money. But I wanted to go behind funds like aspect ventures that's run by Theresa Gaou and Jennifer Fonsdatt who are looking at these opportunities and they have a thesis around my gosh. There are so many opportunities there if we go towards funding some of these women businesses. Some LPs have said to me, all we care about is returns. Some of the best investors may not be the best people, but they have the best returns. What do you have to say to those people? I have to say you're investing in what you know. And so you need to look at what trends are coming in the nation and how you're going to dress them. Women are 85% of consumer dollars spent. Women control 70% of financial decisions in the house. So if you're not investing in products that go towards females or a women led company, you're missing an opportunity because you just don't see it. Japan's critical role in the global economy is changing as the world recalibrates. After decades of stagnation, Japan's leaders are forging a more innovative and sustainable path forward to revitalize the nation. Corporate giants, policymakers and pioneers tell us how they're doing just that. Every week on Japan ahead, right here on Bloomberg Television. So what's the best investment advice you've ever put in? You haven't done anybody. The compound interest, the compounding of returns is an incredible miracle of business, finance, and human existence. Everything you learn is additive every day. And if you keep at it and don't quit.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1077,2022-11-20 04:30:59
18464," A circle of business, finance and human existence. Everything you learn is additive every day, and if you keep at it and don't quit, it's an incredible miracle. And it's not just interest. It was always said about compound interest returns. Compound business returns, compound human returns. They're all very additive because you learn every day. And if you keep at it, it's very, very helpful. In your observation of investors, what do you think is the biggest mistake that average investors make? Selling it the wrong time. And they sell when the prices go down? Yes, or yes. Not keeping. But people have conviction or they invest for the, if they invest for the right reasons, they just keep at it. Today is the most significant day in the history of the NCAA. The last day on planet Earth in the United States of America, in college athletics, where name, image and likeness laws will not be on the books. And kids will be not allowed to make money off of their name, image and likeness. Today's the last day that amateurism has at least a shadow meaning in our culture. Major ruling from the Supreme Court involving you. The most seismic change in college sports happened in 2021, and its aftershocks are still ricocheting across the landscape. Non-Pro athletes getting paid for use of their name, image and likeness until last year banned by the NCAA is now allowed and it's changing the face of sports and business radically. According to OpenEndors, brands spent almost a billion dollars in the first year of the new rules. And that number is only going to grow. But some of the biggest winners, they may surprise you. Top female athletes are caching in and women's basketball players are standing center stage. Your heels, you want your heels to go down. Yeah, you took a pre-ride poop. And I always really is pretty surreal. I don't think I've really wrapped my head around the concept that I am making money. Just doing the thing that I love. Starting her sophomore year, AZ FUD's already signed deals with Chipotle, American Eagle and others, earning tens of thousands of dollars leveraging her on-court prowess and off-court social media following. She's also getting massive investment from the pro game as well, becoming one of the first athletes to sign with Steph Curry's SC30 Inc. The two even designed to shoot together. One Steph Curry would wear during his 2021 NBA finals, MVP performance. It's an investment directly into a future player, but also the future of women's basketball. And especially for the women's game, NIL deals may not only benefit the students, but the pro game as well. But I'm gonna call Carly Knows Everything. Hey, hi, Carly. I held my TV mounted on the wall in my room and I'm wondering if I'm moving back into the same room, can I just take the TV off and leave the mall? Kind of all the little things that I said I have too much of. AZ FUD can almost trick you into thinking she's just a regular college student. You can't judge me by what you see here today. We just finished our summer session, so I'm about to move out, I gotta completely move out to remove in the exact same apartment. I'm so nervous, I gotta carry this back. Who's gonna help you move all the big stuff though? Oh, well, you see, I leave tomorrow, so I will be probably playing at all nighter, but not if my mom is watching this. I will be going to sleep early and getting my rest. Don't let a messy dorm room and procrastination fool you, though, it's very clear, very quick, that there is nothing ordinary about her. FUD was the class of 2021's number one consensus recruit while she was playing for St. John's College High School at a DC. Now she's playing for one of the most storied and winning programs in any sport in history, the University of Connecticut Huskies.

18465," on college high school out of DC. Now she's playing for one of the most storied and winning programs in any sport in history, the University of Connecticut Huskies. The national championship goes to Connecticut for the fourth year in a row. As the dynasty fulfills its destiny. Winners of 11 national championships, producers of Olympians, and multiple WNBA MVPs. But AZ has something that the trailblazing women of UConn's past never had. The opportunity to not only play basketball, but get paid for it. I remember just learning that you could profit off of your name and brand and like, I could profit off of AZ, the basketball player and not just AZ, the person, which I didn't really understand why you couldn't because at least for me, like, AZ, the basketball player is also AZ, the person like basketball is such a huge role in my life that I didn't understand why I wouldn't be able to profit from it. It's a board not understand exactly what made this all possible. In 2021, after decades of debate, lawsuits, and legislation, the NCAA prompted by a unanimous ruling by the Supreme Court finally relented on one of its longest standing strictures that athletes could not in any way be compensated beyond scholarships and small stipends from their schools. It would only take a few months before AZ, a freshman at the time, would sign her first major deal with Chipotle. Before the freshman even got to play a game for the Huskies, she ain't her first NIL deal as a college athlete ambassador for the magnificent Mexican restaurant chain. You are on the leading edge of something that feels, for those of us who've been looking at sports for a long time, like a very meaningful moment in sports. Like, the economics are changing. The role of sports in society is changing. We see that from the outside. You're inside it. You're, does it feel momentous to you? You can tell how important it is, but at the same time, this is all I know in college battles, NIL. So I'm still trying to find my way in it, find my groove and stuff. But I know how important it is, and the people before me paved the way and set that path for me to be able to do this, and how important it is for me to be able to take and manage of this and be able to continue this on for the athletes to come. While colleges and universities still can't directly compensate their athletes, those athletes can legally be paid by third parties who want to use their name, image and likeness or NIL. AZ, advised closely by a team led by her parents and her agents, has created a portfolio anchored by relationships with Chipotle, American Eagle, sports strength bio-steel, and SC-30. Brands, she already admired as the successful athlete and American teenager. I've been lucky that the deals that I've been approached with have been things that have been really good and things that have, like, American Eagles, one of my favorite brands, I always wear their jeans, so it's one of the easiest transitions type things. Bio-steel was something that I hadn't really tried before, and once I did, I really liked it. MUSIC On the basketball side, it's impossible to be on UConn's campus and not feel the weight of history, especially when you see where the team works out. Officially called the Worth Family UConn Basketball Champion Center, it's a 78,200 square foot complex that costs $40 million. It's most striking feature. It's split right down the middle between men's and women's basketball. Seemingly identical when you walk in, except while the men's team boasts four national championships, the women's side has more than double that. And that actually understates their dominance. The team has gone undefeated in six seasons, and its players have been staples on the US Olympic team. Suburred and Diana Tarrassi are only the latest in the line of superstars that began in the early 1990s with Rebecca Lobo. The Huskies have featured 12 AP national players of the year, including Lobo, Maya Moore, Twice, Rihanna Stewart, three times, and most recently Paige Becker's, will get to her in a minute.

18466," Okay, so you're moving in on me quick. Just stradzing me with your fancy hands. I'm going to deal with your night because it's really bothering me. Ah, my night. Yeah, he's a troublemaker. Yeah. What did you get up to this weekend? You know, just robot stuff. A lot of chess. I was practicing for, uh, for you. I know you're pretty good. Ooh, I don't like that. I will take this. Oh, put it over here here. Not cool. Not cool. All right. I will, I will concede. I can see. You've got me, Bid. Very good game. Well played. Thank you, sir. Thank you. No one covers the world like Bloomberg. The writings on the wall for the bank of England. Just a oil has spray painted the current door. Recession in Europe, UK, and possibly the US. We are out in full force celebrating the election victory. A former president, Lula, that's you. With unmatched reach in resources from more than 120 countries, the moment news breaks 24 hours a day. You are global business authority. This is Wilberg Daybreak, but let's do work. Welcome to Daybreak Australia. It's Hannah Declose. Welcome to Bloomberg crypto. Banners are, I mean, they're overwhelming for me. And I'm not, you know, standing in your shoes. What do you take from that personally? I think it can be seen for sure as like overwhelming kind of pressure to live up to those standards. But I use it kind of as motivation. This is our Yukon program like there's no need to compare ourselves to the past like we're not those players that we see on the wall. We're different players like I'm A.C. I'm not super. We need to forge our own path and our own story in the Yukon books. Global goes to work in the land and a beautiful. Those former Yukon stars helped to establish the Yukon team as a product to watch. Over the last decade, meteorites moved from Connecticut public television to SNY and now include Fox Sports. With game coverage mixed with behind the scenes documentaries, Yukon has become one of the biggest platforms for women's basketball. The Yukon women's team is so well known that at the moment it's arguably a better platform than most, if not all of the professional women's teams or even the WNBA overall. Well, I don't think there's any greater female sports collegiate brand than Yukon women's basketball. That's on TV. You can follow those athletes. In a way that if you're parent to the WNBA, you don't always get consistency of coverage local or international markets. You're not always able to follow those athletes. It feels so nice to be back. This is Angela Lergero. She's a former hockey player and four-time Olympian. She now runs Sports Innovation Lab. That's a Boston-based company that uses data science to help teams and leagues understand their fans and figure out how to better engage them. The future of sports really is how do you optimize and drive revenue in these digital spaces, these digital communities? So collegiate athletes are going to really benefit from the change in the NIL ecosystem because they're authentically themselves. They're using these platforms already and they're being entertainers. I'm not sure how to work this. I think it's recording. Fans of women's sports and female athletes want more authenticity. These fans are dying from not just the game and the stats and the scores. They want to know what you're doing 24-7. They want to know what these female athletes think. What are they wearing? What are they dating? What do they care about? What are their causes? And that's going to build a wave of support when those athletes graduate that they'll hopefully bring to those WMF.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1080,2022-11-20 04:44:00
18467," your world of actually doing it speculated about the consequences and maybe some of the unintended consequences of any of that. I only think, well, you know, the really prominent players like you were going to benefit and then other players are not. And so maybe there's some jealousy or envy or whatever. How do you make sure that it doesn't? We were very tight. We're a super close group. I mean, you've been to stores or not. There's not much else to do besides play basketball and hang out with each other. And I think it also is because that whatever deals we get, like, you share with each other. So I have a deal with Chipotle and my whole team whenever they watch Chipotle, they let me know or American Eagle, they can get whatever they want. I think it goes both ways with whatever deals. Other people have that we're super open, always willing to share. I think I'm posting on Instagram about this. This would be the last team meal for AZ before going on summer break. And when we next caught up with her, it would be about as far from a dorm room in stores that you could possibly get. AZ's out in LA this week to do a commercial shoot for a new underarmers shoe alongside both Steph and Seth Curry. Along with her is her family, including her former coaches and current business screens, her mom and dad. We make sure that one of us is at everything that she does just to give her that support. So I've been at a lot of them still blows my mind like, okay, well, you look really cute in that outfit, but it just doesn't like really, I don't know, sink in that that she's this public figure for lack of a better word. The partnership with Curry is both historic and important well beyond the deal itself. AZ was the first woman and the first college athlete to join the SC30 brand and has developed a friendship with Curry. She fully concedes to initially being a bit star-struck. So really a reminder, isn't it, just how sensitive the markets are to any commentary about trade. We did see pressure on the UN, we did see some pressure on the futures. That is now being reversed. You've got to explain this one to me. What does it mean when the White House says we're watching markets carefully? It means they have a Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. They have been an insane it. Lots of Bloombergs. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. What does it mean? What does it mean? What does it mean? It means they have a Bloomberg. That's kind of crazy. I mean, I try to keep my cool when I'm working out with him and then like with Seth and Seth on set, but in my head I'm going a little bit crazy. Yeah. I first met him at Curry camp right after my freshman year in high school. I got invited. I was one of the first two girls invited to camp and then I was invited the next year as well and then Curry brand reached out to my agent, my group and they let me know and that was all for it. I'm working out with someone that I look up to and someone that inspires me. So getting to see firsthand him in action, what he does behind the scenes. I get to challenge myself and compete a little bit with him. It's amazing. Shooting ads for unreleased at peril isn't something cameras are welcome into, but Aze is also in LA for basketball, getting private workouts with Steph Curry's own trainer, Carl Bergstrom. Aze has also been a part of Curry camps, including this past summer in San Francisco. She also helped design a shoe for the SC 30 line. The Curry himself wore in an NBA finals game this past season. The 2022 Bill Russell NBA finals.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1081,2022-11-20 04:51:38
18468," She also helped design a shoe for the SC-30 line that Korea himself wore in an NBA finals game this past season. The 2022 Bill Russell NBA finals MVP award goes to Stefan Curry. Did you know that on average women have 30% less income for retirement? CIA was one of the first brands where I got to use my platform to speak out about title 9 and retirement equality. I think that's definitely something that I still want to continue to do, but that was big for me because I'm still trying to figure out what I stand for and what I support and things that want to be able to support. She's got to formulate her own understanding and opinion about life. We all have our own perspectives. And that's what makes us all unique. We all have our own opinions and experiences. I'm just proud that she found the level of comfort to be able to speak on something that she had no idea existed. I didn't know existed. Retirement inequality women retired with 30% less income and retirement than men. I didn't know that was a thing. And I think from being a girl dad, having her come along has awakened my senses to things that my wife has experienced as a player that I've seen firsthand being a girl's basketball coach, that the girls endure. It's been pretty tremendous, honestly. And as a fellow girl dad, Korea's involvement with an inequality campaign was notable, but not surprising for AZ, who said she was drawn to his brand as much for his off-the-court persona as his championship pedigree. He is a very big family man. You can see that with his kids, with his wife. And I'm huge with my family. Like I do everything with them. They're with me here on this trip. So I think the family aspect was huge and just kind of his personality, like he welcomed me in right away. Even when I was at camp, he made me feel part of that group and special. Just being here, like I feel like I'm really part of this part of this brand, part of this team, part of the Korean family. And I could be more grateful. Kobe Bryant forever, of course, remember, does an NBA legend and rightfully so, but it's a father of four daughters. Korea's also filled a void that AZ and others thought might be left empty after Kobe Bryant and his daughter Gigi died tragically in helicopter crash in 2020. Bryant had been arguably the biggest advocate in the world for the women's game. And without him, it was unclear who would carry that torch. That was kind of a big question when Kobe died. It was like who was going to step up and continue to like help fight for women's basketball and help kind of raise the game. And I think Steph is doing a really good job of like trying like inviting women to his KM and little things like that that are helping to elevate the women's game. And like this deal is incredible being not just the first like NIL, the own college athlete, but also the first female sign to his brand. I don't even really know what word to use to describe that feeling when I first signed it and being here now like it means so much. AZ's connection to and reliance on her own family was unfolded display in LA. She'd come to the West Coast with her mom, dad and two younger brothers and her success as a burgeoning business provides some fun perks. On trips like this, I love just watching my parents reaction because they've been in the game. They've always played in college and they play professionally. So seeing their reaction to kind of where I am, it's just really funny. I mean like my dad loves being around all these NBA players. My mom loves seeing all these high level workouts. So seeing like them happy. It's really fun. Hi. AZ's parents both played division one basketball in college and coached her throughout her youth, which she credits made her the way she is. Even if sometimes it's not so easy to grow up with two coaches for parents. Part of the reason that I am the way I am is because they didn't really compliment much. So I always had something to work on. I was always working hard. I think they did a very good job, obviously. My playing really bad. I would hear about that. But they did a really good job of separating mom and dad from coach. Yeah. I remember when I was younger, my dad would take me off to get ice cream and stuff after games. That was something when we started coaching. And we were very cognizant of not having that coach role carry over. I harbor things a little more. So sometimes they'd go get ice cream. And I'd be like, yeah, she's soft. Why are you getting ice cream? It wasn't the ice cream. But then he really likes it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1082,2022-11-20 04:56:00
18469," Coach Roll, Kerry O'Barr, I harbor things a little more. So sometimes they go get ice cream and I'd be like, you know, she's soft. Why are you getting ice cream? It wasn't the ice cream. But then he really likes ice cream too. So when I started the coach, I definitely did not want to have that contentious relationship at all. And so the ice cream thing became a reminder to me of a treat to like now I get to go back and be dead. Katie Fudd played at NC State and then Georgetown in the late 1990s. As women's basketball was starting to gain a bit of traction and the WNBA was in its form of years. She had to deal with inequalities that she never wanted her daughter to face. When it came time for AZ to pick a school, her mom had a big influence. When AZ was getting recruited, I I felt very strongly about what is the culture. And when I was at Georgetown, it was kind of a men's basketball program and not really much else. It's evolved since then. But in our practice time was limited on the court based on when the men practiced or you know, it was just all based around the men. So there's a lot of schools that she was looking at where they they had some storied men's programs. But how do the players interact? How does you know what's the culture on the campus? Like let's make sure that we're doing the right thing by by both the men's and the women's program. AZ's parents were able to go from being her coaches to fans in the stands but now have evolved into her advisory board on her branding deals. I think we spent the better part of the pandemic on seminars and YouTube and listening talk. I probably have a four-year degree and I have a cell phone and IL just because you're just making sure we understood it as well as we could to help her but also connecting with the right people. I think the fact that we have such a great relationship with her, she trusts us implicitly. Like we're not going to put her in a situation that one she doesn't support the company or doesn't, you know, she wants authentic stuff and then we're not going to put her in a situation that just isn't isn't good for her. As the new season starts, AZ's NIL deals existing in new will be in the background. Expectations are always high at Yukon and even more attention will be on her given Becker's injury. While new NIL opportunities grab headlines and attention, AZ has a clear focus on what's ahead. How do you raise your NIL game? How do you grow it in a way that's authentically easy? I think now that I've my first year kind of under my belt, I have established my brand with all these other people but I think I need to be able to kind of like establish my own brand more like the AZ brand and like post about myself more as well but I think just knowing that what your priorities are that my priorities right now are basketball in school because without good grades, we'll be able to play and without basketball, I wouldn't have these opportunities in these deals. You will shed light on dark matter. You will make aging optional because when you subscribe to Bloomberg, you won't just get news. You will get insight into limitless possibilities. Before you change the world, Bloomberg. When the price of anything goes up, the consequences reach far beyond what you'd expect but perhaps most of all when it comes to food. In 2010, surging food prices helped spark the Arab Spring. Lives were lost, regimes fell and the consequences are still with us. Once again, food prices are rising and fast. Energy costs, broken supply chains, and surging demand were just some of the factors that have driven food prices to their first record high since the Arab Spring. And that's all before a war between two of the world's biggest food producers. Ukraine is called the bread basket of Europe and taken with Russia the two account for about a quarter of global wheat trade. They produce more than half of the world's sunflower seeds in oil, nearly 20% of the barley. Now throw in rising energy prices and processing, transporting, even refrigerating food gets more expensive. Plus, fertilizer production is extremely energy intensive. Less fertilizer means lower crop yield and prices rise even more. The pandemic revealed how complicated and fragile global trade systems are. Global agriculture perhaps even",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1083,2022-11-20 05:00:16
18470," Revealed how complicated and fragile global trade systems are, global agriculture perhaps even more so. Unlike metals for example, food goes bad and crops take months to grow and are vulnerable to unpredictabilities like the weather. Rising food prices will be felt everywhere, but the poorest countries in the world will be hit the hardest. And as all these factors compound, the real fear is that record high will lead to record high and ultimately to a global food crisis with vast consequences. Imagine simply climbing a cable into space. The concept is known as the space elevator. Not only could it significantly change how we leave planet Earth, but it could also completely transform humanity's relationship with space. And there are scientists who think and could have already built it. We have the material, we have the technology, we have the lasers, we have the climbers, we have all of it. If a private entity wants to build it or a government, they can build it. It'll change society. We have no clue how colonizing in the space, how really spreading on this space really changed our society over the next 50 to 200 years. It'll be completely different. A week of hope about inflation and interest rates, about China's relations with the United States, about Britain getting serious about its budget, and of course, former President Trump's hope that he can do it all again. This is Bloomberg Wall Street week. I'm David Weston. This week, Special Contributor Larry Summers on what came out of the G20 meetings in Bali. And former Fed Vice Chair Rich Clarita, the liquidity problem in the Treasury's market, and what can be done about it. It was a week of hoping, hoping that things just might start to move in a better direction in U.S.-China relations, after a President Biden's meeting in Bali with President Xi. I absolutely believe there's need not be a new Cold War. I do not think there's any imminent attempt on the part of China to invade Taiwan, and I made it clear that our policy in Taiwan has not changed at all. Hoping that inflation may just be easing a bit in the United States with Fed Vice Chair Leo Brainer telling Bloomberg, we might see a bit of moderation in rate hikes. I think it will probably be appropriate to move to a slower pace of increases, but I think what's really important to emphasize, we've done a lot, but we have additional work to do both on raising rates and sustaining restraint to bring inflation down. Hoping that the new British government has gotten the message as it put forth a new budget designed to reassure the markets. So today we deliver a plan to tackle the cost of living crisis and rebuild our economy. Our priorities are stability, growth, and public services. And then of course there's that special kind of hope the former President Trump brings to everything he does, deciding that despite what happened in the midterms to his hand-picked candidates, this was the right time to announce he's running again for President. In order to make America great and glorious again, I am tonight announcing my candidacy for President of the United States. Even as prominent investor and Republican supporter Ken Griffin of Citadel couldn't find much to hope for in Mr. Trump's candidacy. He lost in 2020. We lost Georgia because of his behavior in the Senate race in 2020. That's a second loss. And then this year the Republicans lost the Senate because the Trump back candidates in the Senate races were rejected by American voters. That's a three-time loser. And I'd like to think that the Republican party's ready to move on from somebody who's been for this party a three-time loser. But whatever we were all hoping for this week, we didn't really get that much out of the markets which traded without real conviction.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1084,2022-11-20 05:04:40
18471," It's a party of three-time loser. But whatever we were all hoping for this week, we didn't really get that much out of the markets, which traded without real conviction, with the S&P 500 off just 7-10s of a percent of the week and the Nasdaq down 1.57 percent and the yield on the 10 year up about 7 basis points in the week at 3.82. To help us sort it all out, we welcome now a sunny, best-sellist CEO of Rock Creek and Bob Michael. I'm the chief investment officer and head of the Global Fixed Income Unit at JPMorgan asset management. So welcome both you. Great to have you back. Bob, let me start with you. I mean, I watched the Econ numbers. I listened to the Fed speak. I sort of felt like I was going both ways at the same time. What did you see? Well, for a bond investor, all of us who have been battered this year, this is one of the weeks that made sense to us. We had a nice tailwind coming in from the inflation data. It was great all the way through core when you look at shelter everything. Yes, the markets went a little crazy. They went wild and the central bankers did what they're supposed to do. They came in one by one and reminded us, don't declare victory yet. These are only a couple of prints. There are more hikes to come, but maybe there is some optimism. And the market settled down. So I look at this week and I thought, this is the first great week in a long time. So, Sonny, is that the way you saw it as well? There's still some more red hikes to come. How many? I think at least another three to start with, 50 basis points next time in December, followed by at least two or three 25 basis points next year. And then we'll see from there. And I think what Bob said is very true at the same time as we were listening to at least three Fed people come and speak. I wrote that I think they all had very different coats and you had some of that when Leibber Nart talked, but you also had the president of St. Louis Fed say something slightly different as if we would start continue with rate increases for a while longer than she had implied. And then of course, we had Susan Collins come in today with even sort of potential 75 basis points. So, we're hearing numbers that are a little bit all over the place and trying to make sense of it. So, Bob, are the markets making it harder for the Fed as a practical matter? They were at the start of the week. I think not so much now. I think we're all in the same spot. We've all got realistic expectations. The Fed's headed to four and a half, five percent. They'll get there sometime in the first quarter. We'll see where inflation is if it's below the Fed funds rate. Some of that gives them some scope to pause on the tightening. We can reevaluate at that point, but right now, bond yields have gone up a long way in a very short period of time. It's time for a breath. Bob, does that get us to a soft landing? Unfortunately, it does not. And I think that's the one consistent message from the Fed. Susan Collins aside, which is there is going to be pain for businesses and households. When you have this magnitude of rate hikes in such a short period and you're also withdrawing liquidity through quantitative tightening, it's going to bite. And we're already seeing it's biting the economy hard. Thankfully, it's also now starting to bite inflation. So, I want to pick up on the liquidity. Just for a moment, if I could have some here. How big a problem do we have in the Treasury market now with the liquidity? I hear conflicting things, but some people are very concerned about it. Big problems, I think Bob lives it much more than I do, but as you know, they're very, very big problems with the trading volumes. And for big traders or even small traders, getting bits is becoming much harder and you're working in a much less liquid environment. And I know between Treasury and the banks, there have been a lot of meetings, but I'm not so sure if we have a solution yet. Bob, could the Fed make it easier with some regulatory changes? It could, but I think the moaning that we hear in the bond market about liquidity, it's always there. We always complain, we don't get the price we want. The reality is, for the last couple of weeks, you could have moved your portfolio in any direction you wanted, up and down duration, up and down credit risk without any kind of penalty. So, I'm not that big a believer in the lack of liquidity. I'm saying we'll be talking about it soft.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1085,2022-11-20 05:09:01
18472," you wanted up and down duration, up and down credit risk without any kind of penalty. So I'm not that big a believer in the lack of liquidity. I'm sorry when we talk about a soft landing, it brings me back to oil because oil did move this week and it moved down in the price of oil. And most people I talked to suggested it was in part because of a concern about global recession, really a backing off or at least a softening in the markets. You came out of that business, you really know energy backwards and forwards. What are we seeing in oil? So as you said, oil prices did the future numbers went down below 80, which was a big shift from a little while ago. But my view is still that we might just avoid a recession in the US if we are fortunate. But we may not be able to avoid it in Europe and the rest of the world. And a lot of the, I think, softness for these numbers that we saw today and in recent days is because of the expectations in China. Now China is starting to open up a little bit maybe and loosen its COVID rules. But that's going to take a while. And I think that softening is, is softening the oil markets and will probably do continue to do that. Is it opening up? I mean, I'm not exactly sure of exactly what's happening because on the one hand, we hear them saying things that sound a little softer on zero COVID and the other hand, we hear about a lot of cases. So it is, it was kind of interesting. We had a team out in Asia this week. And they came back with interesting news that there is actually some physical opening up. But now you have people who are afraid to go out because they've been told so long that they're, if they go out, they'll get COVID. And so you have seen a very different phenomenon, which is actual, you know, individuals not wanting to go out of their houses versus the government, which has been very strict about you're getting out of your house. I'm sorry, I was at the G20, of course, meeting with a Bali. And some people thought there would be no single statement coming out of it. They did come to some agreement in part driven by some of the developing countries. Should that be encouraging to investors, actually, that we're getting back perhaps a little toward multi-lateral cooperation? Much more positive news came out of the G20 than we all expected. And as you said, there was also a lot of big stress on reform of the multilateral lending because the big news out of that meeting was that there's huge needs when it comes particularly to emerging markets, climate-related investments. And there's no way with the existing finances of the multilaterals that that could be met. So that was why there was a lot of emphasis on the reform of the multilateral sector, but also getting the multilaterals to work much better with the private sector to generate more resources. And you saw that very particular case of Indonesia, which was discussed a lot and written up a lot with about 20 billion going into replace coal in Indonesia with cleaner fuels. About another important development this week, it's sort of a rolling development, as the outcomes of the midterm elections. We found out that the Democrats will hold on to the Senate. The Republicans will get a narrow majority in the House. What does that communicate if anything to investors? Is that sort of a steady as you go way because we have a split government not much is going to happen either way? So it for sure is, I will tell you, going back to the G20, we're actually hearing from clients, large institutional clients, that they're more confident of it, confident about allocating to markets when the G20 countries are talking to one another again and working with one another again. So that's a huge positive. I don't remember that in gosh over a decade. When you go back to the gridlock in Washington, I hate to say it, but the markets kind of like it. It's when there are dramatic policy changes. You have to reprice everything in the markets. It becomes destabilizing. There are always going to be some winners. There are going to be some losers. This time, if we know we're going to have gridlock, we can focus on bringing inflation down and trying to avoid a recession and have a soft land. I think a lot of people in the street think that it's sort of hypocritic. First, do no harm. If you're not doing anything, you're at least not messing things up. Bob Michael of JPMorgan and I'm sorry, a bachelor's of rock week, will be staying with us as we look at what this week meant for our investment decisions. That's the next on Wall Street Week. I'm Bloomberg.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1086,2022-11-20 05:13:21
18473," MUSIC What do you think of when you think of a battery? Most it's what we use to power devices for both work and play and maybe even your car. Over the past few decades they've gotten way more powerful, long lasting and affordable. But all of this is just a prologue to what the next batteries are going to do. As we drive to an increasingly renewable power driven grid, we also need to be able to store energy and release it later to cover those periods of weather intermittencies that are driving this new grid that we're in. It's a multi trillion dollar opportunity and it's imperative that we figure out the solution here. How we store energy on a massive scale is in many ways the central challenge of the fight to stop climate change. In the David Rubenstein show, here to peer conversations, I uncover the untold stories of the world's most successful leaders. Watch Wednesday's on Bloomberg Television. We think it will create some of the most valuable companies the markets have ever seen. I think it's driven companies like Cisco, given them the life they've had. It's obviously also spectacularly volatile. The market has pulled back in this sector since it came public since it began in 1995. It's pulled back 30 to 50 percent at least seven or eight times. That was Henry Blodget talking about the internet and tech on Wall Street way back in June of 2000 when the number one movie in the country was Mission Impossible 2. The most popular song in the country was Maria Maria by Santana. It's not Michael of GPMorgan and of Sonny Bachelors of Rod Creek are still with us. So, Sonny certainly Mr. Blodget was right that we gave us some awfully big and successful companies. No question about it. Some people thought that would happen as well in the crypto space. This week we're not quite as sure after FTX. What do we make of that? Does that have broader significance in the markets or is it just a one-off? Hopefully, it is more limited. I think there's no question that without regulation and we've all been talking about having this sector regulated. It would help. It's the market itself that also the investors going in. Having this particular, you know, FTX, which is an exchange core crypto, be based in the Bahamas with not just no regulation, but also with few people who had very limited experience in finance or in anything really. I run it. I think the shocking part of it, David, was that very, very sophisticated venture firms from Sequoia and others who were invested. It was not just retail getting involved in that market. So it was a surprise, but hopefully it will get limited. And I think it has put a lot of pressure on increasing regulation sooner here. And that will be a good thing for the market. Now, let's not forget that the whole market is less than, you know, a 900 billion. I'm not saying that that's tiny, but it's still not significant enough to create any kind of stress in the market unless we're missing something that we don't know at this point. I think what's important, David, when you watch that clip, and that was the absolute peak in the.com bubble, yes, there was a massive shakeout. There was a massive consolidation.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1087,2022-11-20 05:17:51
18474," When you watch that clip and that was the absolute peak in the.com bubble, yes, there was a massive shakeout, there was a massive consolidation, but I would argue the internet and tech evolved far beyond what any of us ever thought it would be in 2000. I wonder if we're going through the same thing with crypto and NFTs that it got a great start. There is going to be a shakeout of Sonya's right. It's probably going to be a lot of regulation, but when I talk to the young people on our desk and our platform, there's still a big believer. And if the millennials are a believer, 22 years from now, they're going to be looking at this clip. And I hope we got it right. That's fascinating. There is no question as a generational issue here. Let's come back to the current generation and people as old as I am. I'm older than you are, but as old as I am. What about bonds? Right now. Do you invest in bonds? The first time in a decade, absolutely. And I will tell you that we're seeing interest from everywhere now. Every wealth management platform in JP Morgan, every institutional client, they're coming to us, they're putting money in bonds, they're looking to commit more, and they haven't done so for years. If I look at where we got to at the start of the year, a general bond fund, the Bloomberg Ag yielded 1.7%. Now we're up at 4.7%. We have 3% higher yields, and that's going to track investment. And as I said, I think the Fed is close to the end. I don't know if they get to 5%, we're kind of in the 4.5, 4.3 quarters percent. That's going to bring a lot of stability to the market at these levels. Bonds are back. So, I'm saying you manage a very amount of money. What about for you, are bonds attractive at this point, or are you just equities? I think as said, what is very interesting right now is even in any foundation or endowment or the assets that we manage, you're finding exactly the same phenomenon where people had moved away from bonds and cash, and where all equities and private investments moving back into holding bonds. And as we're sort of reaching that 4.5%, that Bob talked about, much more interest in bonds in a more balanced kind of portfolio. And of course, people are looking at cash with 4% at Treasury bills at the level that is much higher than cash in a very long time. But I think the bigger thing that is happening in the portfolios we're looking at is obviously a lot of investors, institution investors who've been also investing in venture, private equity, real estate, in private form. And I think that is going to some sort of transformation too. Well, let's take a segue if we could from that sort of investment into COP27. As we're speaking right now, it's still going to end on Saturday. Right now, of Sony, you know far better than I do. It looks like it's going to be difficult for them to get to the objectives that they had. You're absolutely right. So far, as we know tonight, the latest news was not too positive, not things could change tomorrow morning, but they didn't really have anything major to announce. Again, as you remember in COP26, they had the G-Fans, which was a large number of large asset managers, signing up to make pretty significant shifts in their carbon print. But most recently, they started walking back from that or not wanting to sign quite on what they had agreed to in COP26. So I think it's very, very important as we're having these meetings. Maybe they shouldn't be every year. Maybe they should be every other year or less often, but show some sort of progress. And the most important part of the discussion this time, David, has been a fact that developing countries again have felt that they are in some cases suffering because if they're an island economy, they're going underwater. If they are affected by droughts and by floods, a lot of it might be caused by those who did use a lot of carbon over the last 10, 20 years. And they're asking if they could get help. And that help is really not coming. And I think that is the really major summary of COP27, which is that the expectations of investments.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1088,2022-11-20 05:22:00
18475," It's really not coming, and I think that is the really major summary of COP27, which is that the expectations of investments into climate are probably less than what we expected going into the COP. Well, and just picking up on that on the investments in it, Bob, I want to come back to you, because I want to things at least I'm taking away from COP27. You can certainly hear, listen to John Kerry, the president's special envoy on this subject. We're not going to get to it from public money alone. It's going to take a fair amount of private investment as a bond person. Are there bonds that are green bonds or in the climate that make sense as a business matter? There are. I think for sure, if you're going to finance something, which is what bond investors do, you want something that has something of a green agenda to it. And we're hearing that from our clients. There's more and more money coming into the space. I think Afsania help is on the way for the island economies. So large-scale investors want to commit capital to this space. Well, the inflation reduction act, as it's called, a lot of people object to that title, put a lot of money into the game here on that private side of sunny. Is it making a difference in the projects that are getting financed? No question. I think the R.A. is a very powerful act and is the largest amount of money going in. And I think that will really help us in the U.S. to invest a lot more in climate-related food and ag in battery storage, in residential and in community-related solar and wind. So that will be a major, major push. And we're seeing, as Bob mentioned, a lot of movement. I agree with him. I think it's just that in COP, where you expected public money to go in, there was a sort of disappointment with that. But the private sector is doing a lot. The young generation is doing a lot. We just need the public sector to jump in when it comes to it outside of the IRA, of course. Bob, last word, are you seeing a difference in your part of the business for the government tax policy when it comes to green bonds? We are. Yeah, absolutely. It's making a real difference, you see it? It is from our perspective. So yeah, everything we see, and we didn't touch on the regulation, there's going to be more regulation poking through what qualifies as a green bond or not, and also to prevent any greenwashing, either in specific bonds or in bond funds. So watch this space. Yeah, okay. We're particularly with the new Congress, come here. Thank you so much. Really great to have both of you. This is F.

18476," Welcome to the world of decentralized finance. Bloomberg's covering all things crypto, the people, the transactions and the technology. Bloomberg crypto Tuesdays. This is Wall Street week. I'm David Weston. It's time to look at what's up next week on global Wall Street, starting with Annabelle droolers in Hong Kong. Well, thanks David. This week in Asia, we're going to be taking a close look at two big elections. Now in Malaysia, voting took place this Saturday just over a month after parliament was dissolved for a snap poll. And then meanwhile, Taiwan that holds midterms this coming weekend. So that's going to be a pulse check on the popularity of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party as of course we see geopolitical tensions continue to rise in the region. Eco wise, the highlight is on central bank meetings in Korea and New Zealand. And we're going to be live from Seoul for the B okay with expectations there for a half point hike. Plus the RV and Z predicted to deliver its six straight 50 basis point move. The 2022 World Cup kicks off on Sunday in Qatar. The tournament is being held in the winter for the first time due to the blistering summer temperatures in the region. Thursday sees rate decision by Sweden's Rick Spank, economist forecast 75 basis point hike with surging food prices could tip the bank to raise by even more. We'll also on the same day get an account of the ECB's most recent policy meeting. And last, certainly not least, you energy ministers will be meeting to discuss policy outlook as Europe heads into the winter. A holiday shorten week for the observance of Thanksgiving day, the main focal point for the week, it will center around the release of the FOMC minutes from that November meeting. A meeting that saw the Fed raise interest rates by 75 basis points for fourth straight time. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said then that US interest rates would go higher than earlier projected, but several Fed members since have indicated that they may be ready to downshift. A handful of earnings next week to watch, including Zoom video, deer, analog devices, Best Buy and Nordstrom. Keep an eye on those last two for a read on the strength of the consumer as the traditional kickoff to the holiday shopping season in the US begins on Friday. The main theme to watch there will be the flight to discounted items by cash trap consumers that seem willing to spend, but maybe not have the same capacity as they did a year ago. David. Thanks to Annabelle Dhruller's Danny Burger and Romaine Bostic. Coming up, we saw it happen in the guilt markets. Could a crisis come to the markets for US treasuries and would it come from a lack of liquidity? We're going to ask former vice chair of the Fed, Richard Clarita of PIMCO. That's next on Wall Street Week on Bloomberg. I think that it's hard to put your head around any narrative, like just be honest. We've had sort of a shift in our wean some sort of circulation fears moment. People were talking about that all day yesterday. Back in 1997, I was interested in the following question, which is there are a bunch of the dinosaurs called sauropod dinosaurs, which had really long skinny necks. So apodosaurus is an ex.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1090,2022-11-20 05:30:46
18477," Following question, which is there are a bunch of the dinosaurs called sauropod dinosaurs, which had really long skinny necks. So apodosaurus is an example. Now, there's a really long skinny tails. So I made a computer model that showed that in fact the tail of these sauropod dinosaurs could actually act like a whip, a bullfip. Now the way a bullfip makes that cracking noise is because the tip of the whip actually goes about twice the speed of sound. And that crack is a sonic boom. I think the way they got her date was to impress the females by making loud booms. Everything you need to get set for the started US trading, Bloomberg the open with Jonathan Terrell. Drilling down in the numbers and preparing you as only Bloomberg can weekdays on Bloomberg. This is Wall Street week. I'm David Weston. We spent a good deal of this week trying to figure out where the Fed is heading on rate increases. And part of what we were watching was the Fed's vice chair, Leo Brandard, who gave us at least some hope that we might be getting closer to slowing down. I think it will probably be appropriate soon to move to a slower pace of increases. But I think what's really important to emphasize, we've done a lot, but we have additional work to do both on raising rates and sustaining restraint to bring inflation down. We welcome now, Ms. Brandard's predecessor as vice chair Richard Clarita. Now global economic advisor to PIMCO. So Richard, thank you so much for being back with us. Good to have you back with us. So do you agree with your successor there? Do you think we're at least approaching a point where we might slow down the pace of increases? David, I do. You know, the Fed has done a lot this year. In fact, it'll be the fastest pace of rate heights since the early 1980s. I do anticipate that at the December meeting they'll slow the pace from 75 to 50 basis points. And I think as we move into 2023, I think they think and I agree that they're close at least to a pause, probably in the first half of next year. They said in the November statement, they've done a lot and they want to see how the rate heights are impacting the economy. So Richard, you have the advantage of having been in the room and having been in the room relatively recently. Give us a sense of what they're looking at their dashboard because I'm going to say the economic numbers sometimes point in different directions. On the one hand, we do have some indications like the CPI numbers that may be slowing down a little bit the inflation. They had the overall inflation still pretty high. It is. And you know, the challenge that faces another central banks in the world is that the economy is running hot and in particular wages in the economy are growing much faster than consistent with the 2% longer run goal. And so I think that the Fed will be looking at the labor market data. It'll also be looking at inflation expectations. We have downshifted demand growth. You know, there's an imbalance between demand and supply. And this year demand growth has already downshifted. So that's an important thing to note. We're certainly along the way to where we need to be. But the Fed has more to do and we need to get inflation back down towards the 2% objective. So everyone seems to agree there's more for the Fed to be done. We just heard Leo Brenner say exactly that. The question is how much more. And part of the question is what's the terminal rate? I mean, how far up do we go? We had some somewhat conflicting indications this week actually. And the banks basically project these things are coming up with very different sorts of answers. What determines that terminal rate? And let me ask you, perhaps more pointedly, some people think the Fed was a little slow getting off the market and getting going. Does the slowness of getting started mean the terminal rate we have to be higher necessarily? David, I don't think so. I think what launching the rate heights in March did need. And I think Chair Powell recognized this.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1091,2022-11-20 05:34:56
18478," David, I don't think so. I think what launching the rate heights in March did meet, and I think Chair Powell recognized this pretty early on, was that it made sense to get to the destination pretty quickly. And that's why we've had the four successive 75 basis point hikes. My sense right now is the committee believes, and I share the view that my baseline view is I want to get the funds rate around 5% if the inflation data comes in on the soft side, maybe four and three quarters. If it comes in on the hot side, maybe five and a quarter, where perhaps is President Bullard indicated maybe north of that. But I think around 5% in the spring will be at a level where they've done a lot. They realize that inflation responds to policy with a lag. And I think that that will be a good place to take stock. So I think that I wouldn't call that necessarily the terminal rate. I hope it is. If the inflation data doesn't improve, then they may have to do more. But I think they will pause at around 5%. So Richard, I think you just put the figure on the thing that at least perplexes me, which is it two-place function. I mean, you've got what the rates are. You also have what inflation is. And how restrictive that is depends on how far and how fast inflation comes down. So going into the spring, if you're at 5%, how far down do you need to get inflation before you say, OK, that's restrictive enough. It's an excellent point because typically monetary policy does operate with a lag. So the Fed wants to look ahead. And indeed, for example, Governor Waller and others have made reference to comparing the policy rate to where professional forecasters think inflation will be towards the end of the year. And I appreciate that point. My own research actually indicates that's a simple thing to do. I think the challenge they face, David, is that quite frankly, the Fed's record at forecasting inflation has not been very good, including what I was there last year. And so I think it's going to be a balance between adjusting policy according to both the forecast and the incoming data. Richard, it's not just the rates that are going on. We also have so-called quantitative tightening as you try to run down the balance sheet, which had gone so far up. Give us your sense of what that is doing right now to financial conditions in the United States. Well, David, it is tightening conditions. Again, quantitative tightening is reversing quantitative easing, so the Fed's balance sheet is shrinking. Now, it's been very well telegraphed, and so markets certainly understand the pace and the modalities of tightening. But it is serving to tighten financial conditions. And that's consistent with what the Fed wants to do in terms of raising rates. So Richard, that takes us to a subject that I know you've heard a lot about. We read about all the time, which is perhaps a problem with liquidity in the treasury market. There's more volatility in the treasury market, as I understand it, but that's inherent in raising rates. The question is, is there additional volatility because there's not as much liquidity? We hear at least anecdotally that some people are having difficulty buying and selling large lots of treasuries. Yeah. Well, it's true. I went back to the looked. I had the privilege of 20 years ago of serving as Assistant Treasury Secretary in 01 or 02. And in those years, debt outstanding was about $3 trillion, about 30% of GDP. This year, it's $23 trillion or 100% of GDP. So quite simply, the amount of debt outstanding and the amount of treasury issuance is vastly larger than it was 10 or 15 years ago. And the plumbing of the intermediation system for treasury says not really expanded can commonly with that. And so as a result, there is evidence on occasion of ill liquidity in the market, certainly in extreme cases, as we observed in March of 2020 or September of 2019, it becomes even more evident. And so I think policymakers at the Fed and the Treasury and other agencies are looking at ways in which treasury market functioning can be improved. And I think it's certainly something that should be studied and improved. And what are possible options if they do conclude there's an issue there? One of my suppose would be reversing and going back to quantitative easing. That's one way to do it. There might be actually to ameliorating at least some of the restrictions in regulation and repose after the 2008 Great Financial Crisis, which really is an issue that took a lot of the big banks, that were limited their participation in the market. Well, it's right. And so I think that one of the things David that we did in the spring of 2020.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1092,2022-11-20 05:39:21
18479," limited their participation in the market? Well, it's right. And so I think that one of the things, David, that we did in the spring of 2020, is that we did relax something called the supplementary leverage ratio in the sense that we would not count bank reserves or treasury holdings against that leverage ratio. The idea is we wanted to encourage banks to lend in the pandemic shutdown. And the Fed indicated when it left those exemptions lapsed that it would begin, it would review whether or not it made sense to include treasury use in reserves in that leverage calculation. I'm sure that analysis is ongoing, but I think that's certainly something worth serious study. What is the rationale actually for the SLR? I don't not sure I understand it, because I would think the treasury is as close to risk-free as possible. You know, the history of this is before the GFC, David, he had risk-based standards for banks. And so, treasuries are not risky, other bonds are more risky. There was a sense broadly in the global community, not just in the U.S., but through the Basel process in Europe and Asia, central bank and policymakers agreed that it made sense to have a supplementary leverage for the very show that typically would not be binding most of the time, but it could prevent, if you will, financial institutions from gaming and entirely risk-based system. However, you know, we discovered in March of 2020 the banks were in great shape. The banks were part of the solution, not part of the problem, and there can be perverse consequences of having a supplementary leverage ratio, especially when central banks are doing large amounts of key leagues. The creating reserves, which the system has to absorb. So I think it's certainly something that could address and I think it could make a lot of sense. Rich, thank you so much for being on Wall Street. We go up to come back often. It's really good to have you. We switch to Clara of Pimco. Coming up, we're going to wrap up the week with our special contributor to Larry Summers of Harvard. That's next on Wall Street Week on Bloomberg. Yes big, expensive cities have a lot going for them. But if you live in one, you've probably noticed that these big, expensive cities keep getting more, well, expensive. You could always move away. You might have just started working remotely, so there's really nothing keeping you there. But then again, moving is a hassle. Well, what if someone paid you 10 grand to do it? What if they threw in free office space, a bicycle or a gym membership? Programs and cities and states around the US are doing exactly that, and they're getting a lot of interest. We've had over 50,000 applications. About 90,000 applications. We've had over 1800 applicants from all over North America. So are these nascent programs actually beneficial to their communities and the workers joining them? Or are they little more than flashy advertising campaigns for places looking for an injection of fresh talent? Hello, listen, we've got new talent for you all on Facebook. This is Wall Street Week.

18480," This is Wall Street Week. I'm David Weston. Welcome back now. Our special contributor, Larry Summers of a Harvard, to wrap up the week for us. Larry, thank you so much for being back with us. A lot of us spent a lot of the week actually trying to figure out where the Fed is headed, particularly where the terminal rate is. And we got conflicting, I think at least, someone conflicting answers out of the Fed, including with Mr. Bullard, the Fed president, saying, well, five, five and a quarter, and then put up a chart using the Taylor rule that suggested seven. Where are we? Look, no one knows. I think it's a mistake to be slavish about Taylor rules. The market thinks the number's going to be about five. I look at things and my sense is there's more room for that to be too low than there is for that to be too high. But it's pretty clear that we've had the big moves on this cycle. And now we're going to be finishing that process off. My view is that there's more risk from stopping prematurely and not really curing inflation and setting the stage up for a re-acceleration of inflation after it comes down. I see that as a bigger risk than going too far because going too far would mean bringing inflation down below 2%. And that still seems to me like an awfully remote risk starting from where we are. But I think that the Fed has this in the right place when it says that they're going to move up somewhat more and they're going to take stock of the situation and see what the inflation data is saying and seeing what the inflation forecasts are saying when we get to next get to the spring of next fall spring winter rather spring of next year. I have to say that if they hadn't made as many mistakes as they did of excessive optimism about inflation they'd probably have a little more room than they do to rely on forecasts that hadn't yet proved out that inflation was going to come down. I talk a lot about monetary policy and fiscal stimulus and things but geopolitics have also factored increasingly and some of the issues having to do with the economy. This week we had what is potentially we don't know if it is an important development in the meeting of President Xi of China and President Biden. What do you make of those discussions and even ongoing discussions because now we have the USTR a madam tie actually meeting with her counterpart. What do you make of the situation with China right now in the United States? Look as Churchill famously said George Jaw is a lot better than bang bang and so the fact that they had a meaningful conversation that lasted more than three hours the fact that they both came out of the conversation with the sense that there had been satisfying dialogue the sense that there are some follow on steps. I think that's all to the good. What it's really going to mean? What really is going to happen? Is there going to be constructive movement out of those dialogues? I think that's something we're going to have to wait and see. But I'm encouraged by what I saw and I think it means that President Biden's whole trip has to be regarded as a success. The United States back in the game with respect to climate in Shammel Shaeke the meeting with Xi. I don't think this G20 will be long remembered but at a very vexing moment there could have been some kind of breakdown and there certainly was not that. As a minimal thing I've read some places people say at least there is a G20 and they came out with a joint communique and it was fairly tough on Russia I think it's fair to say and the reporting behind the scenes are is that some of the developing countries like Indonesia and India help drive that process which might I don't want to overread it suggested maybe we're taking a half step back toward multilateralism? I think I think I think we are.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1094,2022-11-20 05:47:56
18481," Overreeded, Suggested, maybe we're taking a half step back toward multilateralism? I think things I think I think we are. I think that what Russia has done has really shocked the conscience of the world and has affected very, very many countries. We'll have to see how this plays out. I think we need to remain aware that in the original vote in the UN General Assembly, there were countries with more than half of the world's population who abstained onto Russia's side, who declined to join in condemning Russia. So I think we've got a lot of work to do, and we in the United States tend to be a bit over optimistic about the extent to which all others see us as in the benign way that we see ourselves. It's such an important point and it takes me back at least to China because it seems to me that sometimes we've been overly optimistic. I mean, for example, going back to the time we admitted to the WTO, we thought China was going to become more like us, and then we go over the other extreme of being perhaps overly pessimistic about China. I guess my question for you is former Treasury Secretary among other things. How do we play both sides of that? We don't know how it will end up. How do we keep open the realistic possibility? We can really work closely with China, but also protect ourselves against the possibility of confrontation. We in the United States probably need to be careful about our evangelizing influence. I don't think it's really for us to tell China how they should organize their entire society. I think it's for us to stand up for some of our fundamental interests in security, in fair economic competition, but to leave it at that point. I think we're going to need to be very careful with respect to our diplomacy on the issue of Taiwan. I think we need to be very careful about giving China the sense that we are trying to change the traditional one-China policy, because I think that could risk disastrous conflict. I think the operative words for us need to be respect for them, respect for positions in the fundamental interests that they have, and at the same time absolute insistence on our own. I would say one other thing, David, I think ultimately we will prevail in this broad contest with China. I think if and when we prevail, it is going to be more than anything else on the strength of our example. That's why domestic renewal at home, whether the issue is scientific innovation or infrastructure, whether the issue is doing something about opiate deaths or whether the issue is strengthening our education system, whether the issue is building on the greatness of our universities or the greatness of our national parks. Ultimately it's going to be our ability to remain the country that's the envy of the world, the country to which people want to come that is going to determine our success. If we change our focus from building ourselves up to tearing China down, I think we will be making a very risky and very unfortunate choice. I want to make a very large turn here. I've had the benefit of talking to you about the masters, about basketballs, I want to talk about Taylor Swift, she's a rather popular pop music star and ticket master because we now know the Department of Justice is investigating possible antitrust problems there because of ticket master which does after all have like a 70% market share that's been under investigation for some time.

I don't know if you know much about Tyler Swift, although I am concerned about you getting tickets, which apparently seems to be difficult, but more broadly, what is it say perhaps about some of the problems with over-concentration in the economy? You know, I want to say two things about that, David. The first is that if the government made a website that functioned as badly as ticket masters has here, everybody would be laughing and scorning the government. And so the next time the private sector says that, you know, the public sector can't do anything right. This was a private sector building a website, sort of like that to build a website for Obamacare, sort of like they have to build websites at the IRS, sort of like they have to build websites for student loan debt relief. And the private sector utterly failed. And that's something that we just have to remember the next time somebody wants to say everything about government is hopeless. Yeah, we are hungry. We are hungry. We are going to have to leave it there. I'm so sorry. We're a humble. We have much to be humble about. Larry, thank you so very much. That's Larry. Some of us are a very special contributor here on Wall Street. Coming up, a lot of people get hurt when there's a collapse like that of FTX, but who stands to benefit? That's next on Wall Street Week on Bloomberg. When U.S. jobs numbers are released, Bloomberg brings you crucial data at terminal speed and instant expert analysis. Nobody covers jobs day like Bloomberg. Watch Bloomberg surveillance early edition for the news you need when you need it. Matt and a little bit of Kayleigh Limes in New York and Ann Edwards in London. Australia's Central Bank raises interest rates twice as much as bull costs. Then surveillance for in-depth analysis. Alongside Tom Kane and Lisa Brownbottes, I'm Jonathan Ferro, the RBI, Fronts and Sensor. How does Japan get away with not raising rates? Can it sustain its normal at a time when everybody else is facing a very different reality? Bloomberg surveillance. Be informed, be prepared, be ahead of the game. Finally one more thought. With Tom Brady's for it, it's got to be good, right? Despite that endorsement from the greatest quarterback of all time, the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX has brought heartbreak to a lot of people. Wiping out in one fell swoop what was estimated to be a $32 billion empire, leaving what its lawyers now say could be as many as a million creditors holding the bag. And by the way, triggering a class action lawsuit against Tom Brady and others paid to tout FTX to the world. The ripple effects of FTX and the rest of Sam Bankman-Fried's empire now beginning here as we wait for bankruptcy proceedings. All of which has shaken the confidence of many investors, that's according to Citadel's Ken Griffin. FTX is one of these absolute travesties in the history of financial markets. People are going to lose billions of dollars, and that undermines trust in all financial markets. But as bad as the FTX collapse may be, it's only the latest in a series of major meltdowns we've seen in recent years. Just think back to 2001, when that mythical energy giant Enron hit the skids. This former CEO Jeff Skilling reflected back on the loss in-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1096,2022-11-20 05:56:37
18483," years. Just think back to 2001 when that mythical energy giant Enron hit the skids. Its former CEO Jeff Skilling reflected back on the loss in his later testimony before Congress. I am devastated by an apologetic about what Enron has come to represent. No words can make things right. Too many people have been hurt too much. Or World Cup. The Telecommunications phenom of the late 90s that followed Enron into bankruptcy in 2002 wiping out a market cap of $186 billion and sending its former CEO Bernie Ebers to prison despite his trying to seek protection behind the 5th Amendment. I have been instructed by my counsel not to testify based on my 5th Amendment constitutional rights. Or that emblem of the first internet bubble, pets.com with that cute sock puppet mascot which was an instant market hit when it went public and just as quickly went flop. All of these notorious failures shared a bold vision, a confident leader and a belief that they would come up with a better mouse trap just like Mr. Bankman Fried. And if FTX follows the pattern it will share one other thing with colossal failures through the years. A lot of lawyers making a lot of money despite all the carnage. When Enron went into bankruptcy it had assets of over $65 billion in the ultimate resolution shareholders were wiped out at a loss of $74 billion. But the lawyers they walked away with over $1 billion along with the accounts. World Cup was three times as big losing investors in estimated $175 billion while the lawyers were making over $10 million a month in a proceeding to last it well over a year. Lehman was forced into bankruptcy amid one of the most turbulent periods in our economic history which culminated in a catastrophic crisis of confidence and a run on the bank. But those were all small potatoes compared with Lehman. A bankruptcy that wiped out between $46 billion and $63 billion according to the New York Fed. And netted the lawyers and other consultants a cool get this $6 billion. So we'll see how much the FTX creditors end up writing off much less the token holders. As much pain as they're feeling though you can be sure that there's one group that will come out okay. It's always the lawyers. That does it for this episode of Wall Street Week. I'm David Weston. This is Bloomberg. See you next week. I'm David Weston. The market that over the past few weeks has made it clear it wants to go higher. It got a little spooked by the idea that beautiful little potential rises. The week is crucial important and I think we've moved from this attitude from its intelligence a waste of time almost an illness that needs a cure. For something as universally important to human life as sleep. Mysteries surrounding its necessity and utility have only just been recently uncovered. Some of our biggest discoveries were in the 1970s or 1980s and so it makes that a really exciting field because it seems as though we're uncovering new insights each and every day.

18484," Teams as though we're uncovering new insights each and every day. Some scientists are going further to find out how sleep and what happens there can be harness to further expand our understanding. It's easy to memorize things that makes you smart if you can spit back a lot of facts. But if you want to be wise, if you really want wisdom, you got to know when and how and why to use that information. And that's what your brain figures out while you're sleeping. From the world of politics to the world of business, balance of power with David Weston, views and analysis insight from and above politics power players weekdays. This is Bloomberg. They're at the vanguard of a green transition. They're delivering locally in a time of global energy turmoil. Utility companies are having their moment in the sun. Energy is on every once in a while. Around the world. Energy independence. Energy prices. Energy availability. Utilities historically have been viewed as stodgy, slow moving, boring companies. I would not be here if it were anything like that. The utilities that are going to thrive in this environment are the ones who have a diversified energy mix, particularly the ones who have a higher percentage of clean energy resources that is reliable such as nuclear, as well as wind and solar and gas in the mix to back those up. Duke Energy, providing regulated gas and electric services to about 10 million customers in seven US states, has flourished in the spotlight. Revenues have rebounded since COVID rocked the industry in 2020. The volatility that's driven profits has also created pressures. We're in a period of inflation. We're in a period where commodity prices are high. So every season of leadership is going to have some particular challenge. And Duke will meet these challenges with fresh leadership. After almost a decade at the helm of finance, Steve Young decided to step away from the role. In September 2022, company veteran Brian Savoy became CFO. I now retire from your position as CFO. I thought it was time. It made a lot of sense. Brian is ready. Succession planning is something that is ongoing at Duke Energy. And this gave us an opportunity to promote Brian, someone who has great financial background, good market and economic background, who also has led businesses, so understands PNL. And so it just felt like the right time to begin that transition. The transition in the C-suite comes as duke and barks on a transformation of its business. Aiming to retire all coal by 2035, achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050, and reshape its portfolio around natural gas, nuclear power and renewables. We're basically rebuilding generation and transmission and distribution to meet the needs of the future. We're going to invest $145 billion over a decade. That is a staggering amount of money, which means it's a staggering amount of things we've got to go buy, replace, install, make work, and do it in an affordable way for our customers. That's a tall order. It's a team effort. So boy, we'll have plenty of support from Young, who's now Duke's Chief Commercial Officer, and Lynn Good, who was once Duke's CFO herself. Any advice you want to give him? Your CFO hat. C-E-O hat, you can't give advice. The CFO hat. The advice I gave him was, you know, jump in with all fours and make this job as big as you can. As you sit at the nexus of so many things in the Chief Financial Officer role, the business, the regulation, the finance, delivering value to investors and to customers, and I think Brian is very capable of doing that. It's an amazing time to be in this role in this moment. Stressful? Extremely. And daunting. There's a lot going on, but I wouldn't have it any other way. Here's what Duke's Power Generation mix looked like in 2021 with coal and oil nearly a quarter of the portfolio. Here's how it should look by 2030. Tables will more than triple as a share of the company's power output. We have the",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1098,2022-11-20 06:05:29
18485," and oil nearly a quarter of the portfolio. Here's how it should look by 2030. Renewables will more than triple as a share of the company's power output. We have been putting pieces in place in our regulated business for several years to really accelerate this clean energy transition. Renewables bring price stability because there's no fuel. Right, see, there's a sun shine or the wind. There's typically a significant capital of front investment, but it's predictable. Natural gas is needed to balance the grid and the reliability needs because the wind doesn't blow all the time. The sun doesn't shine all the time. The batteries can't bridge the gap enough. Right, so our plan is to reduce natural gas over time, but use it as a bridge fuel as we proliferate renewables. And nuclear has been just a tremendous benefit for our customers. And we see promise in future nuclear in the 2030s as we move through transition. That's not the only transition Brian Savoy will manage. Duke wants to focus its time, money, and resources on its regulated businesses, and it's looking for a buyer for his commercial renewable energy holdings. Our commercial business is one that I ran, so I'm very familiar with, and it served us very well. But it is only 5% of our company, right? And our regulated business has a clear path to growth and the competition for capital spheres inside our company. And there are a lot of interest. There's a lot of money you want to invest in green energy. They are performing a strategic review right now of this business, and I think it makes sense to do so, because in the utility space, to really get credit in evaluation for a non-regulated business, such as renewable generation, you have to do it at a much larger scale. And it does make sense to take a closer look at maybe somebody else is a better sort of capital here in recycled capital to redirect that into the regulated business. Duke forecast earnings growth the 5% to 7% through 2026, driven by a lot of capital investment. The company intends to spend a whopping $145 billion in the next decade, with a lion share going to changing its energy mix and modernizing its grid. Brian Savoy is in charge of deploying this capital under highly challenging conditions including the highest inflation and most volatile energy prices in decades. When you get a surprise like high fuel prices, we need to adjust things like O&M. And so work with operations and the relationships I have throughout the company are positioning me well to help influence our operators to adjust their cost as we need to for customers. Do you feel that reducing costs right now, while also increasing spending, is different than in the past? Because of the inflationary pressures, because of the energy transition. I would say yes. There are a lot of pressures on the business that we might have had in short spells in the past, but it feels more systemic that we're going to see, you know, inflation for some time, higher commodity prices. With the kind of volatility, if someone comes to you as a hate Brian, so I need some more money for my division to do this. Are you like the no guy? Or are you able to be really nimble and make sure you can be the yes guy? I would say I'm the how can we? Okay. But if we say yes to a request that was emergent, we've got to say notice some other things. So how do we prioritize and make it all work? CEO and former CFO Lin Good knows how hard this balancing act can be. I think anytime you're trying to balance, you get pulled in various directions. There will be a pull to build more renewables by certain of our stakeholders. There will also be a pull not to go that fast because it could be too expensive. Maybe our industrial customers are worried about price. The vulnerable customers are worried about price. So trying to strike that right balance with policymakers, with customers, with investors is a challenge in any moment and there will be a challenge in this one. Take me inside some of the conversation you guys are having a Duke right now. So you and Lin and other C-sweeings that could have sitting around on table. What do you guys talk about most right now? Supply chain has been a moving target of issues. Last year at this time, we were looking at solar panels and how do we lock in our solar panels that we need for the next several years to ensure we can execute the clean energy transition. It has moved to different components like transformers, which are essential for the grid.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1099,2022-11-20 06:09:50
18486," It has moved to different components like transformers which are essential for the grid. Interstrates and the pace at which the Fed is moving interest rates is something we talk about each and every week. And when will that flatten out and how will that impact our business? We are a very large debt issuer. So we watch this extremely closely because it affects our cost structure. Do you want to wait until interest rates level off and then is that delay your capital raising to deploy your plan? We don't wait but we do plan. There's opportunistic times to issue debt. We will go with larger pieces or versus smaller. And we can work with the length of the debt. If 10 year is price more attractive than 20 or 30, we'll use the tenor to optimize the interest rate. That's all I knew, yeah. Yes. Coming up, Brian Savoy takes me to the room where it happens. An expert team gathers data and makes decisions that keep dukes renewables running smoothly.

Brian Savoy is taking on a new challenge as he steps into the CFO position at Duke Energy. It's really just his latest challenge. He's touched virtually every area of the company over the last two decades. I started my career at Duke in Houston in our trading business. And I was with Deloitte Tuce before I joined Duke. Duke was one of my clients. You know what I saw in Brian was tremendous enthusiasm and energy. He was ready to take on new assignments. He was thinking about advancing the ball for the corporation as opposed to any personal goals. And that came through. He helped us on a number of complex projects. And the more we gave him, the more he continued to grow. I've had five different roles in 10 years. And I've seen different parts of the company from transformation, leading natural gas and commercial strategy. This has prepared me for the role I have today. What's the advice that you've given him? You know, I've told him a couple of times that you're not going to get a home run at every ad bat. There's going to be days where things go wrong. Be patient, be calm, keep your eye on the ball for the future. The thing you want to get to eventually, you'll have bumps in the road. Fixing things that go wrong and smoothing out bumps in the road is what customers expect from energy providers. And for Duke's renewable assets, that process is overseen from one room in an office building in Charlotte, North Carolina. Brian Savoy showed me around the company's Renewable Control Center. This is where our operators are monitoring and managing over 5,000 megawatts of renewables across the United States. How would this differ from like a conventional assets monitoring center? Yeah, so assets historically, they would have the monitoring center on site. So you might have an operator with screens, but at the site, whereas this we can do 90 sites. If there's offshore wind, onshore wind, solar, and they're looking for the smallest change in output because every megawatt hour is money. You put an asset in, let's say it's 100 megawatts, right? You expect to get 100 megawatts each and every hour that the resources there, the resource could be sunshine or it could be wind. And when you get 90 or 80, you're not producing what you can. And it can be because the asset isn't working properly. Maybe something hit the turbine blade on the wind bar. Maybe the solar panel has debris on it, or it could be the solar intensity is not quite there. When one of these assets isn't producing.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1100,2022-11-20 06:14:01
18487," The wind, or maybe the solar panel has debris on it, or it could be the solar intensity is not quite there. When one of these assets isn't producing full capacity, we're putting another resource on it, and we're having to toggle this on a consistent basis. And this as clouds come, this is by the minute. This is not, or the hour it's off now, it's by the minute, and then it'll fall, come back, and we have assets that follow this digitally as well so that we can keep a consistent flow of electrons on the grid. The operators in this room can respond to incoming data with immediate action, remotely controlling wind turbines, solar panels, and batteries. It's another example of using digital and technology tools to make us more efficient, to make us more productive, minimizing the amount of people we have to have running around and observing, and giving us the statistics to really be able to maintain and monitor those facilities. We couldn't see degradation and output as fast as we do now with the technology and the digitalization of the system. Now we still need technicians nearby. And so we use traveling crews that can go, say, sites in Kansas versus sites in in South Texas versus central Texas, and across the West. We have around the clock shifts, but about 20 people rotate through these shifts. And again, recovering 90 sites, we've got about half a dozen people here at any given time managing it. You could think that would scale at over time as renewables grow in the United States. So would you say that as you invest more in renewables, it's a hardware thing or a software thing? Like where do you think we spend the most money doing that? Obviously the software will continue to improve over time. And the sensors on the equipment are very important to, again, identify those degradation and output, but it's deploying the hardware, deploying the assets on the ground, getting the sites ready, connecting to the grid is a huge lift. Duke's hardware and software mix keeps evolving, and so does its workforce. Retooling also means retraining. We've moved people to the renewable space. Some of these folks used to be in coal. We've moved people to software security, which is a growing area that we need more and more because as everything gets digitized, there's more opportunities for bad actors to penetrate. So we need high-siber security skills, and when you match that with operating skills, you really have a beautiful mix that makes a strong, strong operator. Operators here have plenty of micro details to keep track of, but there's a macro factor on their minds as well. That's the weather. We have maps in the United States just to gonna give the operators a bearing of what's going on in the country, and we have plotted on it where our renewable sites are. So they know if there's a weather pattern, weather system coming, I expect that in that area. How do you manage extreme weather? So let's say we have a wind farm in the west and a wind storm is coming. Yeah. You know, the assets will turn off when the wind speeds exceed a certain level automatically. Okay. Because there's risk of breakage of the blades and damage to people and assets and stuff. We know a wind storm is coming that might damage the solar or a hail storm, for instance, right? We can watch those assets closer, we can put a crew on site, but this team would be dispatching those crews onto the location. And that's where like the weather map and the team like really works. Yeah. That's right. From hurricanes in the south east to wildfires in the west, extreme weather events are becoming more prevalent and more intense. Utility companies are bracing for greater risk. When we think about the impacts of extreme weather events on the grid, large grid connected resources would still, such as large-scale solar farms and large-scale wind farms would still rely on a centralized grid to deliver electricity to the load centers. So to the extent that the grid is knocked out by a hurricane, those assets would go offline as well. So in addition to investing in a green generation resources is extremely important in companies pay attention to grid-hardening measures. We're seeing more of it, more frequency of severe events and how we predict those, monitor those and estimate the damage using data analytics and machine learning to say, how many customers might be out of this happens, what generators are at risk, and all that modeling goes into our planning for what we put our investments. We talked about the capital plan earlier. All those investments.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1101,2022-11-20 06:18:24
18488," You might be out of this happens, what generators are at risk, and all that modeling goes into our planning for what we put our investments. We talked about the capital plan earlier. All those investments are informed by the climate trends that we see across our system. Coming up, Duke's Clean Energy plans get a major boost from DC with the Inflation Reduction Act. Brian Savoy is already working through the possibilities. For example, 1,000 megawatts of solar equates to about 60 million in annual production tax credits. This is Bloomberg. The light of the biggest names in business, choose Bloomberg. It had to be great questions. It's great question, great question. Great question, best question I get all night. Remember, top experts, great questions. We will never break. Build on a foundation strong enough to stay. We will never break. Have the water rises and the mountains shake. All of who will remain. We will never. No. You'll get insight into limitless possibilities, knowledge and inspiration to feed your ambition. So before you invent pioneer, disrupt, before you change the world, Bloomberg. The next decade for Duke Energy is pretty clearly mapped out. Raise and spend $145 billion on a massive clean energy transition. But the bulk of those investments into regulated businesses while investigating the sale of non-core assets to fund that push. It will all be up to new CFO Brian Savoy to execute this plan and make sure it delivers optimal financial growth. The motion is adopted. Congress passed the inflation reduction act in August, putting provisions in place that make his task more manageable. The inflation reduction act provides incentives for renewables. It provides incentives for battery storage and it provides incentives for nuclear. All of those incentives for a regulated company go right to our customers. They reduce directly the price of our product. So when I build a renewable product, it's going to cost me less and it'll cost my customers less. It's going to help our renewable transition. For example, 1,000 megawatts of solar equates to about 60 million in annual production tax credits. We're going to have 30,000 megawatts of renewables on our system by 2035. The inflation reduction act has been a very important piece of legislation. It's not only that it creates a number of incentives for a variety of assets. It also is very durable in long term. So instead of a patchwork of different tax credits that we've seen in the past, it actually creates a light path going well into 2030s for this long term transition on the grid. Political winds may shift and regulations are always subject to change. For the moment, policy in Washington aligns with Duke's strategic goals. What do you think there's a real partnership now? We have.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1102,2022-11-20 06:22:36
18489," And regulations are always subject to change. For the moment, policy in Washington aligns with Duke's strategic goals. What's like there's a parallel partnership now? We have a voice at the table. I have a lot of conversations with the Treasury Department about tax policy. And as they define the rules around the IRA, they will seek input from people like us. And we will weigh in. This is what you should think about as you write the detailed rules to implement this act. When it comes to relationships between utility and policy makers and regulators, those have always been extremely important. Those utilities that have cultivated those relationships in a constructive fashion, where they've been good stewards of capital and operate the system well and took into consideration interest of various stakeholders in addition to the equity and debt investors, of course. Those materials enjoy relationships with the regulators in our experience. And that over time translates into constructive rate outcomes. And better recovery mechanism. Recovery mechanisms are set at the state level. They also help companies and customers absorb the capital costs of the clean energy transition. We cannot adjust our price without working through regulators. And modern recovery mechanisms allow us to adjust price more frequently and align with our investments. So that when the investments start causing expenses, revenues follow. And there's alignment. Otherwise, we call it regulatory lag where you have expenses before we can earn revenues on those assets. Historically, we would build up investments then have what's called a rate case and have a large increase in one's lug. The modern recovery mechanisms place assets and service each year, essentially. So your smoothing rate increases over time. So customers can plan better and we can plan better. Even with meticulous planning and regulatory tailwinds, US utilities must proceed with caution. Europe's energy crisis highlights the fight between green energy and energy security, raising questions about how fast and hard the world can pivot. There's been criticisms, say, in Europe that they were trying to go too fast into renewables, for example. And therefore, they left out nuclear and they sort of shuttered coal plants and now they're paying the price in that respect. What's the right pace? I think the pace is maintaining balance with reliability and affordability. That's the only way we know to gauge pace. We will not put a plan together that we don't have a high degree of confidence. We can serve our customers every hour, every season. And we have to keep an eye on affordability. We call it a responsible balance transition. The transition away from fossil fuels is coming. I mean, just think about coal. Five years ago, you could get as much coal as you want. Now coal's constrained and it's going to become even more constrained. So operating coal assets is not even going to be an option as we move through time. So the convergence of energy, independence, and security, I believe, is coming soon. That's the state of play for Brian Savoy, as he starts his tenure as Duke's CFO. I asked him what he sees when he looks ahead. What is the biggest opportunity over the next 10 years to CFO that you're most excited about? Over the next decade, I feel like utilities have a moment to really make a mark on society. And again, it's long lasting. It's going to be for our grandkids and their grandkids. So putting the utility sector in prominence of the world, that's what I wanted to do. What's the biggest challenge? What are you most worried about in the next 10 years in doing your job? I think the biggest challenge is balancing investment. The investments we need to make and the transition in front of us with the cost to customers. Because the oversight by regulators is only getting more and more and more. And we've got to be more clear on the customer benefits of every dollar we spend that turns into value for customers. And I can see this playing out in just hand-to-hand combat over the next decade. And we will work it. And we believe the investments we're making will meet that bar. What is a skill that you have as CFO that you think will help that? I'm wired for value. I don't like waste at all. And when I see things that we need to change, I have the courage to make it happen. And as CFO, I'm in a position to really move that and do. And what's a new skill set of knowledge that you're excited about over the next 10 years? I would say the new skill set would.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1103,2022-11-20 06:27:09
18490," of knowledge that you're excited about over the next 10 years. I would say the new skill set would be how to balance all of the external views of the company with the internal. I've worked inside this company and have great influence, but ensuring that similar level of influence is out in the external world. What's the best advice you've received coming into CFO? I would go back many years ago, over 10 years ago, I was working for Lynn. She told me, Brian, the skills you have positioned you for a wide range of roles. I had no idea what that meant. This was like 2009, but as I've looked at my career and she has moved me to gain experience across Duke in the right areas of operations and strategy, that advice back then, I didn't appreciate, but I appreciate it now more than ever. I'm Alex Steele. This is Bloomberg. What are the moon shots at Amazon that are capturing most of your time and attention? We have a unique way that we will get big new investments. I'm not sure it's right or wrong. It just happens to be our way. We ask ourselves when we're considering something for questions. If it's successful, can it be big and move the needle in Amazon? Is it being well served today? Do we have a differentiated approach? Do we have confidence there? If not, can we acquire quickly? If we like the answer to those questions, we'll go pursue it with a single-threaded team that isn't distracted by the rest of the business. When it comes to the stock, it has fallen significantly. Do you think investors are missing something or has tech just been overvalued? I have never tried to predict what stocks might do. In any time, I've tried to a little bit. I've been wrong. I do really believe that in the short term, the stock market tends to be a voting machine. The long-term tends to be a weighing machine. We have a concept we talk about a lot of Amazon inputs and outputs. In the ultimate output for a company, a share price. Then other big outputs are free cash flow or profit or revenue. You can't really manage the outputs. You have to manage at the input level. That's where we spend all our time. If you do the right things for the business long term, things tend to work out. I think we've had very good returns for investors. I expect that to be true again. Hydrogen has a very special place in the universe. It's the first element on the periodic table. It is the most abandoned element in the universe. When clean energy advocates think about what can we find, which would be as easy to use as fossil fuels, they think about hydrogen. The fuel that will when burn only produce water. We like to imagine that if we just built enough of these and these, we could ditch fossil fuels and save the planet. Unfortunately, it's not that simple. There are some things we just need good old-fashioned combustible fuel. Now, startups around the world are betting that hydrogen can become the fuel of the 21st century. It's the most powerful fuel of the world. It's the most powerful fuel of the world.

18491," For you change the world, Bloomberg. Every Friday with 30 minutes dedicated to fixed income, I'm Jonathan Ferro, this is Bloomberg Real Yield. Before the COVID pandemic upended the way the world does business, logistics was one of those industries that might have been taken for granted. That's not the case anymore. Due to all the turbulences over the last two years, customers are now realizing how important it is to have a reliable logistics partner on their side. How are people doing a quite complex job? People think, oh, they just deliver passes somewhere, that's an easy. If you think about what are people doing, it's quite complex. Businesses and consumers are suddenly thinking a lot more about how things they need reach places where they're needed. It's thrust the sector into the spotlight. Logistics and supply chain has become a household need. It's dramatically different than pre-pandemic. Yes, it's grown, whether that's in market power, revenue, profitability, investor interest. For Deutsche Post DHL Group, that's created opportunity to build on momentum and set ambitious goals for service and performance. When you look at our footprint, you're the most international logistics company there is. We want to become more digital, and we want to be much more sustainable than we have been. DP DHL's revenue has soared since 2020, with full-year profit nearly doubling in 2021. CFO Melanie Christ is a key leader of the team that's delivered these results. And she views her role as much more than just a number cruncher. There are unfortunately these clichés that finance is boring, and it's kind of like being counting in the back office to be successful in finance. I mean, you have to have the financial expertise, right? But we also have to be credible business leaders in order to really impact the business and steer the direction. She is extremely smart and bright. You need somebody who is able to digest a lot of information that are rapidly and can distinguish what is important, what is less important, and she has tremendous skill in that. And she's not afraid to call people out, to call out other members of the executive team if she feels that something isn't being. She does that in a very nice way, actually. She helps me tremendously in steering the company because she is highly regarded by my other colleagues in the senior team, and typically, if they have a problem, they share at first with her before they come to me. When I think about the conversations I have with Frank, the shortest part is actually about the analysis and the facts. It's more the debate about, okay, on that basis, what are the options? What can we do? My role is essentially saying in three sentences, what is working well in this company? Where do we have challenges? And what should we do going forward? Deutsche Post DHL Group consists of five divisions. Express Germany's Post and Parcel Service, global forwarding and freight, supply chain, and e-commerce solutions. Each of these segments has seen revenue growth in the last four years, while the surge of e-commerce volume during the pandemic has had a direct impact on the trajectory. Have you seen e-commerce as a very structural and fundamental growth driver for us as a company? What we now saw under the pandemic was a structural acceleration. It took us forward to a point in terms of e-compensation, which we probably would have reached on the normal circumstances in three years' time. So it was a big step forward. DP DHL was well prepared to take this step. The company's strategic plan recognized e-commerce as a growing trend in the logistics landscape, but no one could have forecast the speed and breadth of the transformation. We are now seeing that also under the pandemic, not only domestic e-commerce has taken a faster growth trajectories and anticipated, but also cross-border e-commerce. And we see...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1105,2022-11-20 06:35:53
18492," a faster growth trajectories and anticipated, but also cross-border e-commerce. And we see that very clearly in our express network, but also in our e-commerce solutions division. What are the other big structural shifts that you see on the horizon? Is it e-commerce B2B? Is it increased trade as globalisation restructures? What are the shifts that you're seeing? The board B2B e-commerce is still at a very early stage, so we believe that there will be a huge cost opportunity there. And we also see that when we are talking to our customers now, I guess everybody has been aware that being dependent on just one supplier in one province in one country is probably not a good idea. So they want to build more resilience into the supply chain. I think our international footprint, our global strengths, is really something we can leverage for the benefit of our customers. Another factor in the company's favour is its balance sheet. Since Melanie Christ became CFO, Cacheflow has improved significantly. One of my priorities over the last years has been to really focus the whole organisation on better cash generation. It's not just a finance job, making sure that ultimately revenue converts into EBIT and into Cache in the bank account is the responsibility of the whole organisation. She says, we can't be successful as a company. If we are not collecting the cash for our services, we have provided. She has not missed one single opportunity to talk about that. I think it's a very comfortable situation, particularly in the current environment, to have a strong balance sheet. I think in that respect, I'm very conservative and I'd rather have a bit more on the balance sheet and a bit more buffer. Spell out for us what the priorities are, the longer-term priorities, in terms of putting some of that cash to use for you. The first priority here is organic growth. We clearly indicated also with our CAPEX budget, 12 billion for the next three years, that we will keep investing into organic growth. We are very focused on our regular dividend payment. And then, if there is something left, which is fortunately the case at the moment, we will think about inorganic opportunities and we will also think about other means to allow our shareholders to participate. That is why we are currently running a 2 billion euro share-by-back program. Inorganic opportunities include M&A, like the recent purchase of beverage shipper, Hila Brand. But deploying cash is always subject to careful consideration. Does Melanie ever turn around and say, no, when you're pushing through or pushing for a particular package of spending? Yes, she does that quite often, you know, because she has... She is a person and that's great if you have a CEO who is risk-abuse, because you need somebody, you know, the business is always too optimistic. Melanie might be something too pessimistic, but that's a very healthy discussion. And if we then jointly come to the same conclusion after a debate, then we are probably in the right spot. How often do you find yourself saying no to divisional heads? So when I was promoted into the CEO position, my team gave me a stamp with rejected. It sits on my desk. I think the fact that people know it sits there already has instilled quite a lot of discipline in the organization. So I think when I get a proposal, it has already gone through a number of iterations and is normally of such a high quality that I don't need the rejected stamp too often. For the time being, Christ should be able to keep that stamp in a drawer. CEO Frank Appell has expressed a commitment to service quality and confidence that customers will accept higher prices that come with it. If you are too expensive, you will be out of business, but if you don't provide the right quality, you will be out of business as well. So we want to be. We will never be the cheapest in town. That's not doable. We are the premium provider. That's our strategy. Of course, it's also more challenging for us when our customers are under pressure. At the same time, I think, over all the last two years have shown that a reliable high quality supply chain comes at a certain price tag. I definitely see that inflation is having a huge impact on the logistics industry. And there's been substantial price increases in the last few years. I do not see that changing. There's a lot.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1106,2022-11-20 06:40:21
18493," Act on the logistics industry and there's been substantial price increases in the last few years. I do not see that changing. There's a lot of innovation happening and I don't see the inflation necessarily going away. It might level out a bit but it's not going to go away. The logistics companies may have pricing power with customers but their stock prices haven't been so robust. I think the issue there is the increase in interest rates has made everyone rethink and be concerned about the level of inventory that is out in the system if you will and with the level of disruption. I think what's happened more in the last three months is the more of a view that we're having into certainly a new coming slowdown maybe a recession. With more than half its revenue coming from Europe investors may see DP DHL as more exposed to recession risk than its global peers. The company insists it can meet its revenue targets in the event of a downturn. It's counting on diversification as a cushion. I'm not so pessimistic that there is really a deep recession at our doorstep. But even then our portfolio is very much balanced. We are everywhere in the world and the world will not go entirely in recession. Would it be a stretch to suggest that DP DHL is to some extent recession proof? I wouldn't go as far as to say recession proof but I think we are very well positioned to deal with all different types of recessions in recent areas due to the breadth of support for you. The balance of support for you really gives us a lot of resilience against any type of headwind. Coming up a look at DP DHL's investments in action. Melanie Christ shows me around the company's state of the art logistics hub. What I love about this building is it actually shows the big mega trends which formed our strategy 2025. This is Bloomberg. Japan's critical role in the global economy is changing as the world we calibrate. After decades of stagnation, Japan's leaders are forging a more innovative and sustainable path forward to revitalise the nation. Corporate giants, policymakers and pioneers tell us how they're doing just that. Every week on Japan ahead, right here on Bloomberg Television. As the chief financial officer of one of the world's largest logistics companies, Melanie Christ has made her mark in global business. That's not what she originally attended today. I really wanted to go into research. I wanted to become a physicist and that was where my passion was. But then during my studies, some friends of mine started doing this strange thing. They went into management consulting. I didn't even know how to spell it and I had no idea what it was about. But what they told me was quite interesting. And so I ended up doing an internship with a consulting firm and I learned more in the two months there than I had in the last two years in my physics job at university. That is how I ended up in consulting. She started her career with three years at McKinsey, then spent four years in private equity with APAC's partners in London before joining Deutsche Post DHL Group in 2004. I was brought into the company to do international M&A project. That was at a time around 20 years ago when we were really building the company in the current shape, acquiring lots of logistics companies around the world. The M&A part was the first thing and I then wandered into a more mainstream finance field here in the group becoming the CFO of our DHL Express division. So from then on it was more leading towards the CFO role eventually. Malony Christ now heads the finance team with around 11,000 employees. Success in this role is as much an art as a science. If you do the greatest piece of analysis and you see it all and you know it all but you can't convey that message and you can't convince the rest of the",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1107,2022-11-20 06:44:29
18494," As a science. If you do the greatest piece of analysis and you see it all and you know it all, but you can't convey that message and you can't convince the rest of the organization that we should move into a certain direction, it's useless. DP DHL is sending a consistent message with its investments. The company spent 123 million euros to upgrade its logistic centre at the Clone Bonn Airport, designing it around key strategic goals. What I love about this building is it actually shows the big mega trends which formed our strategy 2025, which was inaugurated in 2019 when this building opened. So globalisation connecting the world. E-commerce, we have a lot of sortation facilities here for smaller e-commerce shipments. Sustainability, it's a very sustainable building, there's solar panels on the roof and everything and digitalisation and well you can obviously see that it is quite automated. How did the team pitch this investment to you initially and how hard was it as a sell for them? How quickly did you turn around and say yes, this is worth 123 million euros. Of course you always have to make sure that you have the right capacity for the growth in the network and at that time they came and said hey we will really see a strong growth in e-commerce volumes on top of the regular B2B growth. We need more sorting capacity, we need this building and of course there are always debates, does it really have to cost 123 million euros and so on. Unfortunately they convinced us because then with Covid and the volume search we urgently needed the capacity. At the same time as Covid accelerated demand for logistics services, disruptions in the labour supply hurt productivity. Advances and technology like this digital sauter have helped offset some pressures but automation also raises questions. Does this tell us that is the business grows, this is going to become a more automated business that is going to be less needed for labour for workers? Well you still see people here and I think what you can nicely witness here is the combination of technology which supports people. So for example when you look at the customs area it used to be a very manual and sometimes confusing process. Now the people are supported in picking the right shipments for customs inspections by light and they are automatically sorted in this sauter to go to customs inspections. So it is also helping the people with the jobs they are doing here every day. We are over set in 2019-20. We might get one third less jobs in the current setup until 2030 if we digitalise the organisation but we are very sure that our company will be at least 50, maybe 100% bigger and we will have more jobs to offer. At the beginning of a couple of years ago when we started that journey people said oh you know I might lose my job I haven't heard that in the last two years as a question any tone hold. This airport have also showcases DP DHL's aviation fleet which both small than 320 dedicated cargo aircraft. We own the biggest chunk of our aircraft but we also have short and medium and long term visas and visit growth in our business we anticipate that the people keep going. You talked about investing of course in sustainable fuel. When does that come online? How significant is it? The critics might say that's just window dressing around a part of the business that is of course very carbon intensive at least a lot of emissions. Yeah so you absolutely write the problem with our beautiful aircraft is the CO2 emissions and when you look at our overall CO2 emissions two thirds are from aviation. It is about flying these birds with more sustainable fuel and we said that we are really willing to spend billions on it. We now really hope that we will see the uptick and supply over the next years. Spending billions isn't vague hyperbole. The company has pledged to put 7 billion euros towards sustainable technologies and fuels by 2030 with a goal of climate neutral logistics by 2050. Sustainability makes good business sense anyway especially if you are in a business that is energy or fuel hungry as a compliance element that not just operators in the logistics sector need to consider but also their customers. So being transparent becomes part of the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1108,2022-11-20 06:48:57
18495," as a compliance element that not just operators in the logistics sector need to consider, but also their customers. So being transparent becomes part of the service about their impact on the globe. We had a lengthy discussion. Should we make a financial commitment how much we want to invest for the next decade in our sustainability? We had a long debate, is it right, to say we want to invest 7 billion until 2030? There were pros and cons. But that was a very intense discussion melody in IHART, where we finally came to the conclusion that this is the right number, this is the right approach. We convinced our colleague and that's the reason why we are where we are, where we are seen as somebody who really commit, they're not that many companies who have quantified their future investment. Still ahead how one of the business world's most influential women is working to strengthen gender equality within her company. I think the great thing is that now across the board in finance but also in the group overall, we have role models which show young female talent that everything is possible. This is Bloomberg. While Tesla's in the like make for good headlines, the reality is that even if every car on the roads today won electric, it wouldn't be enough to curb global emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions from transportation account for about 29% of total US greenhouse gas emissions. So what about the other 71% building to cross America burned fossil fuels to operate? What we want to do is make that all electric. Instead of burning oil and gas to give us the energy and electricity we need, we want to do 100% clean energy all electric. We want to turn buildings into Tesla's. Just like a Tesla or an electric vehicle is all electric with no fossil fuels. We want to do that with our buildings. And if we can do it in one building, we can do it in all buildings. And if we do it in all buildings, we'll reduce 30% of US greenhouse gas emissions. No one covers the world like Bloomberg. The writings on the wall for the bank of England just stop oil has spray painted the front door. Recession in Europe, UK and possibly the US.

Bloomberg, you are global business authority. Deutsche Post DHL Group CFO Melanie Christ is often named to lists of the most powerful women in business. And while men still outnumber women as finance heads of large companies, there are signs that the balance is shifting. The number of female CFOs across major US companies has risen to an all time high, according to a study by Chris Colder Associates. An executive search firm Cohen Partners reports that 36% of new CFOs hired by notable companies in the first half of 2022 were women. I ask Melanie Christ if she's encountered obstacles as a woman rising through the executive ranks. I have to say I have not made many negative experiences. Maybe I was also a little bit in the even thought thinking about these challenges so much. So I mean when I started physics there weren't many women so I was somehow always used to it. And it can also be an advantage.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1109,2022-11-20 06:53:11
18496," thinking about these challenges so much. So I mean, when I studied physics, there weren't many women, so I was somehow always used to it. And it can also be an advantage when you're kind of like the only girl in the room. I mean, the boss at the end remembers your name and not the 19 guys who all kind of like were dark suits and white shirts and look alike, right? So I never experienced it as an external stress factor. I have to say for me personally, it was more balancing my own expectations around kind of like getting family and the job combined. But that was probably more of a pressure I put on myself, thinking that I had to be perfect in every dimension and not something where the pressure was put on me from my male colleagues. So how do you take that experience and put it to play in terms of how you advance the role of women in this organization? I think the great thing is that now across the board in finance, but also in the group overall, we have role models which show young female talent that everything is possible. In finance, we have a share of women in management of 32%. So we are ahead of the group. We want to get to 35% by 2025. I think we are now at a position where if we have a vacancy, I want to have at least one woman on the shortlist. Because we have enough female talent. So every shortlist should contain a woman and then the best person in the race should win. CEO Frank Appell says Christ sets an example for the entire organization. And he believes her success may influence the entire industry. She has proven that she is an outstanding CEO for all. And she's definitely a role model in many dimensions. That you know, what I like about there, she is still you know, a very warm and nice person. And that makes such a big difference. So you can get to that level without compromising on how nice you are as a person. I think she's a great role model. And the whole that this has had positive impact for many of us. From the big picture down to the smallest operational details, Melanie Christ is fully engaged in guiding DP DHL into the future. I wanted to know what she sees when she looks ahead. What do you see as the biggest opportunities? For DP DHL over the next 10 years. I think we have a fantastic portfolio. And we just have to leverage the growth opportunities which are there both on the ECOM site and also on the traditional B2B site. And the key differentiators for us will be digitalisation, sustainability, and our great people. As you look ahead 10 years, what are some of the challenges? What keeps you up at night as you think about the business going forward? I think we have to keep this focus and the ability to adjust in a very agile way. Sometimes when you kind of think about all the risk controlling and stuff, people tend to create the impression that you can preplan everything. That's clearly not the case. So I think we have to stay focused and keep the ability to react in a very agile way. But looking at what happened over the last 24 months, I'm very optimistic that we will also be able to cope with whatever happens next. And how do you see your role changing in the years ahead? I think it is changing at a very rapid pace, which is a great thing because it never gets boring. Those elements I just mentioned for the group overall, digitalisation and sustainability are also hugely relevant for the finance role. It's like a new language you have to learn. And you learn the vocabulary, but then you also have to develop a feeling if I kind of like put so much capital into this decarbonisation measure. I get so much in terms of return out of it. But that's a fascinating opportunity where we can make a huge difference for finance and for the group overall. As you look to the future, Melanie, what do you think is going to be the skill sets, the knowledge bases, they're going to be essential to the success of future CFOs? Yes, probably the two most essential new skills will be to get even better at lifelong learning because we will have to learn so much new stuff every year. Be it in the digitalisation area, be it on sustainability. So this ability also has a 50-year-plus-old person to...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1110,2022-11-20 06:57:40
18497," So this ability also has a 50-year plus-old person to keep learning and keep the curiosity. I think that is going to be super essential. And the second element will be being a great team player. The word is complex. You can't know it all. So you really have to work even more strongly with your team. What advice would you give to someone who's just recently being appointed CFO? That's a great question. I think I would probably simply say, be curious and ask as many questions as you can. Try to learn as much as possible, not only in the finance area, but get close to the business. Try to really understand the business, because only when you are close to the business and you understand the fundamental profit drivers, will you be a really great CFO. I'm Tom McKenzie. This is Bloomberg. So is there more pressure when you're trying to win a basketball championship than when you're trying to please investors? Where's the greater pressure? Oh, I think it's definitely trying to win a championship. It's hard, because when you invest and you know this, when you're investing, you can control a lot more things when you're on a basketball court, you can't control whether somebody's going to make a shot, you've got to get lucky. And what's the greater pleasure making five times your money on a Distress Dead investment or winning the NBA championship? They're both fabulous. I wish I could do one each year. That would be great. But I think there's a great feeling in being right on an investment that you've done a tremendous amount of work and you've made money for your clients, which I think is great. I think winning a championship is a very surreal feeling because there's a whole city or state that is actually behind you. We had 70,000 people at the finals. And we had them all outside. It had 17,000 in stands. And then literally like 60,000 people outside. And when we won, like just the joy that you had brought to the city was phenomenal. So what's the best investment advice you've ever been given by anybody? The compound interest, the compounding of returns is an incredible miracle of business, finance, and human existence. Everything you learn is additive every day. And if you keep at it and don't quit, it's an incredible miracle. And it's not just interest. It was always said above compound interest returns, compound business returns, compound human returns. They're all very additive because you learn every day. And if you keep at it, it's very, very helpful. In your observation of investors, what do you think is the biggest mistake that average investors make? Selling it the wrong time. And they sell when the prices go down? Yes. Or yes. Not keeping. But people have conviction, or if they invest for the right reasons, just keep at it. You've got to explain this one to me.

18498," Jingbao. Genius and unflapable even in the heat of a corporate crisis. That's a reputation of CS Venkete Krishnan. Known as Venkat amongst colleagues of former Barquays markets chief took over his chief executive after Jess Staley's abrupt exit in November last year. In his first TV interview since getting the top job, we talk about the bank's so-called universal model of retail, corporate and investment banking. So what are the challenges that lie ahead and where does he see opportunities? Will Barquays have to increase provisions for loan losses as a cost of living crisis gets worse? Over the next 30 minutes, we talk strategy, investment banking in Europe, the future of the city of London and how inflation will change the banking world, with the man who's in charge of Barquays for the lost 12 months. Venkat thank you so much for speaking to Bloomberg, so 12 months into the job, what have you learnt about yourself and the bank? The last 12 months have been a wonderfully educational experience about myself. I've learnt how much more I needed to learn about banking, including running a large organization, finding ways to encapsulate what our ambitions are and to convey and get to so many people and then visiting all the global footprint of the bank we have. It's also been a wonderful year in terms of the bank's operational performance. We've managed a bunch of crises and we've managed them relatively well I think, but it's the start. We are in a middle of a tough economic environment. So in terms of strategy, the strategy hasn't changed that much from your predecessor. Is it about execution or is it a different lens that you're looking at it with? So I was part of the team that set up the strategy seven years ago and our strategy then was to simplify our footprint, focus on building a global investment bank that was very highly competitive. We are now number six, we are the biggest European investment bank. It was about doubling down in the UK where we want to be a leading financial institution in sort of everything, retail and wholesale and it is about building up a very specialized consumer business in the US which we've done. We like the footprint, the businesses are operating well. I think now it is the striving to excellence which is to make sure that in all the businesses which we do clients and customers know what we are about, we do the things that we do very well, we don't have hobbies, we are very focused, we execute well and it's about excellence. But can you really compete with the US bank in terms of having an investment bank? Can Europe have that leverage or are you always going to be one step below? So we are competing. We are number six, we've been gaining market share and share revenue share in our markets business for many years. And we are under no illusion that we are not going to catapult, nor do we want to catapult the number three or number two. But we can be very good at what we do and if we are good people will transact with us and work with us and you can make a very good living at the size we are. What you want to get bigger is now if you look at the pipelines and things that are coming through is now the right time to employ more bankers. Two slightly different questions about getting bigger. One is I think that as long as we do well and organically we grow, that's fine. I wouldn't want to take large steps but if it happens in an accumulation over a period of time, that's welcome because it's gradual. But bankers, I think it's a question more about what sectors of banking. We've made a big push in sustainability and we continue to expect to do that. And obviously pulling out of some old economy sectors are reducing it not to zero but there is a shift in the banking wallet and we respond to that. And I think sustainability is very important. Are you expecting more IPOs, more pipelines? You mentioned the environment that's a little bit uncertain at the moment. What does the next 12 months look like? I think it is going to be a difficult environment for the first six to nine months of that 12. I hope by the summer when people are able to sort of see the end of the rate rising cycle, it may not have happened by the summer but hopefully you can forecast the end of it with reasonable confidence then businesses will feel more confident themselves in what they want to do about their capital raising and capital.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1112,2022-11-20 07:06:19
18499," With reasonable confidence, then businesses will feel more confident themselves in what they want to do about their capital raising and capital planning. But I think it will take a little time before we see that clarity. What's your biggest concern out there on the markets? I know you had some good results. A lot of it has to do with also how you traded your traders performed very well. But we have a very uncertain environment. We don't know what inflation looks like, the cost of living, you have exposure to mortgage. There's leverage out there. What keeps you up at night? Well, I think what we've had this year is a series of incidents which would have been difficult to forecast at the start of the year. Even at the start of the year, I think across the industry people were cautious because they knew we were at the start of a rate rising cycle. It's never good for credit assets in those periods. It's not good for equity assets generally in that period. Then you have the Russia Ukraine war. And then here in the UK you had that little volatility with gilds and LDI. So there are pockets where there could be leverage and there are pockets where they may be rapid movements. And in this kind of a rate rising cycle, you would expect to see that happen. So it's rather than being specific worries about certain things, it's being generally aware that you're driving a car when it's rainy and the roads may be slippery. So what does that mean in terms of risk management? What does that mean in terms of you preempting some of the things that could go on? We have been operating through the year with relatively less risk and what I would call relatively less long biased risk, meaning expectations of asset prices to rise, then we would normally have done or had done a year or two ago. So in the language of traders we manage from a defensive position. Which means that things could still go wrong in unexpected ways or that you feel confident that you have this. You live through the financial crisis. And every two weeks somebody says this is going to be worse than a financial crisis. This is worse than 70s. What kind of crisis are we going to see and what's it mean for the banks? First of all, I don't think as far as the banking system goes, this will be worse than the financial crisis. I think banks are much better capitalized but much better risk managed and much more aware of the importance of doing that than they were back then. And the regulators are also much more intimately involved and engaged with the banks in understanding bank exposures. So I think it's not going to be like that. I think from our point of view and speaking for Barclays, what we have to worry about is the impact on consumers. We are starting at a point where people have strong balance sheets and employment is very high. So these are very good initial conditions. But squeezes are coming in different ways. In the UK, to a greater degree than the US, you've got the energy price squeeze. And also in the UK to a greater degree than in the US, you've got a squeeze coming from higher interest rates and mortgage prices and rents. Because it's more of a variable rate market. It's more of a fixed market than it used to be. But it's more variable than the US is, which has a 15 or 30 of fixed market. But you're not seeing that right in consumer spending right now. You're not seeing it in mortgages either. Is there a worry that we're complacent? And then at some point, next year or early next year, it hits us hard. Not that we are complacent. But even though we've started off in a good condition, there are factors that are eroding that strength of the consumer balance sheet. What I'm hoping you see is what people will call a soft landing and a shallow recession, helped by the initial conditions. And so what you might see is an increase in unemployment. You might see some credit weakness among customers, but it won't be so bad that you see distress in society. However, it has to be managed carefully and it has to be managed aggressively with a balancing of the budget. And that's what the Prime Minister has said in the last couple of days.

For no coastal points to India's incredibly competitive education system, if you can survive the pressure it takes to get into one of the Indian Institutes of Technology, it gives you confidence to handle American universities and later the business world. Meanwhile, the belief in India's ability to produce so many tech wizards is reinforced every year. Indians make up about three-fourths of the immigrants receiving coveted H1B visas for the US.

Visit Bloomberg.com webinars. The end of the year. Talk to me a little bit about the last six weeks. So you mentioned the guilt. Was there a moment where you were in the office thinking, like, as Barclays, you're one of, of course, the players in selling in buying guilds with the margin calls coming in and saying, like, I don't know what happens in the next two hours. So first of all, I think that the volatility was managed extremely well by the very effective, targeted, and time-bound actions of the Bank of England. So I think buying guilds, buying inflation linked guilds, and then the repo facility that they put in working with the banking system all helped ease the pressure in the crisis. And you've got 10-year guild heels now back below where they were at the day of the mini budget on the 23rd of September. As for us, we are large in the guilds market. What was important for us, as we saw it, was this was not a solvency issue at all for the pension system. It was a liquidity issue. And it was a liquidity issue because what was a very important feature of the UK pension system, which, by the way, I think is a good feature of the pension system, which is a matching of assets and liabilities, which employed leverage, created a liquidity problem. So a liquidity problem had to be managed. And the liquidity problem was managed by the government intervention or the Bank of England intervention, the repo facility, which allows people to borrow against assets rather than sell them and by slowly releasing the pressure. And so far, so good. Do you think that will change, actually, where you're liations around new pensions in the UK? So I don't know the answer, but I think what is important is that the UK pension system in aggregate is very well funded. It's about a 125-130% funded ratio, which is extraordinarily good, which gives it a good starting point from which to manage to a less leveraged future. It is liquidity. You're the biggest concern for banks right now. I mean, we're, again, hearing the US Treasury Secretary having to do things, maybe, to put a bit of extra liquidity or to pat it out in the Treasury market. Bank liquidity, I don't think, is an issue. We've had liquidity regimes. Funding models are much, much more robust than they were in the financial crisis. I think part of what people are worried about and what they saw in the guilt market was the liquidity in underlying trading, which is that these markets are not deep with smaller bid-offers in large sizes of trades as they used to be 15 years ago. And I think part of it, our banks are more prudent in managing their risk. So that's a good thing. It's a good thing, but it has a consequence that the big providers of liquidity have moved away from the banking system to the buy side. Do you worry about shadow banking? And is there any crossover? Does that, if you look at the system as a whole, if there's something wrong with shadow banking, does it impact the big banks? So it impacts the big banks. And by shadow banking, let's all narrow it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1114,2022-11-20 07:15:09
18501," If there's something wrong with shadow banking, does it impact the big banks? So it impacts the big banks and by shadow banking let's, I'll narrow it. I'll narrow it to, let's call FinTech companies. So it impacts the banks in a good way and a bad way. So in a good way, what they've done is they've provided digital technology ways of giving services to customers, which customers like. And it's made us up our game, right? And faster than we would have otherwise. And shame on us for not having done it earlier. Now, when they go into credit, which some of them have done, they have less regulation than we do, which is perhaps not good for customers who deal with them, who may not get the protections they do if they deal with us. And perhaps not good for them if they don't lend with quite the rigor and standards that more established companies might. On the second issue, that's a supposition. Let's see. What's your relationship like with the new UK government? Have you had calls? Have you, have they given you assurance about windfall taxes? Well, I think the government is brand new. So we obviously, many of the faces are very familiar faces. And we've been dead, you know, in communication with them in many, for many years. And we always are with the government. And, you know, we are waiting to see their proposals on taxation, on fiscal policy, on all aspects of it. Where do you see the city of London being in four or five years? I mean, that's maybe too long a time frame. Should I say 12 months? Well, it's both too long and too short. You know, here we are in the city. And this city has been the center of finance for 300 years. And it needs to be the center of finance for 300 more years. We certainly would wish that that were the case. And it is the center of finance because of an excellent regulatory system. Transparent, fair. It is there because of great availability of talent and infrastructure, soft financial infrastructure and hard financial infrastructure. And a part of that is also a stable, predictable taxation regime. So we hope that all those elements and ingredients remain and continue to allow the city to flourish. And, you know, the Prime Minister spoke about investing in education in Britain. And if you think about what drives the financial sector, I mean, you meet many of them. It's about the wonderfully trained people in the UK and the wonderfully trained people outside who are able to come and work in the UK. The UK has lost something. When city of London has lost business to other parts of the world in terms of, you know, financial capitals. Yes. What do you need from the government today for that to be reversed? Well, some of it is what others do, right? So once Brexit happened, and you could not pass vote financial services to London, all the major banks had to set up trading enterprises in Europe. So that is irreversible, let's say, for the time being. I think other than that, what we need is a continuation of what London has provided. You know, education, infrastructure, people, a great regulatory regime, and a stable and predictable, you know, fiscal regime. Vincke, until not too long ago, Barclays had an activist shareholder on its back. Do you think about that? You always have to think about it. I don't think about it from the point of view of our business mix. I do think we have a good business mix. And that activist shareholder came because he thought we should sell our investment bank. He could not have been more wrong. I repeated, he could not have been more wrong. The investment bank has been what has kept Barclays flourishing and quite apart from many of our competitors. In the fact that, you know, we performed extremely well during COVID, we are able to have a more diversified business model. But I think for many banks like us where our valuations are low, you know, you've always got to be worried about what is driving bank valuations. The top names in climate change are on Bloomberg.

18502," kind of action that we need. We have a global emergency now. You know, we're still putting 162 million tons of man-made global warming pollution into the sky every day using the sky as an open sewer. That's trapping as much extra heat as would be released by 600,000 erosion of class at Tom & Tom exploding every day. That's what the scientists tell us and the data shows it. That's crazy. That's why we have a third of Pakistan underwater. That's why we have the historic heat wave in China. Nothing comparable to that ever. That's why the heat records are broken every year and we're seeing an increase in the flows of climate refugees crossing international borders that are due to vastly expand unless we take action to solve the climate crisis. Nobody covers climate change like Bloomberg, your global business authority. Is Europe overbanked? Europe is against separate Europe from the UK. I don't think the UK is overbanked. I think part of what drives bank valuations, especially in Europe versus the US, is there is some worry about business model. I think in our case we've got the right business model and what will drive our valuation is solid performance, excellent performance, as I say. Repeated, excellent performance. I think in Europe banking is still fairly nationalized, not nationalized in state-owned, but by country. I think we have to see at some point the experiment of one large European bank crossing borders in a meaningful way. When do you think that will happen? We've been talking about it. I feel like for two decades. It's a question more for the European bank CEOs. I think it should happen. I think the test case should happen. Now is a good time. When you go through a period like this, there will be some banks which will benefit from consolidation and ownership by a larger entity. I hope I see it happen and it will be good for Europe. Your bank is doing pretty well. Others are doing less well. We talk about Credit Suisse almost day in day out. Have you been able to get some business from clients that no longer want to bank with them? Well, business goes or everywhere in the banking industry. Obviously, where Credit Suisse has pulled out of certain businesses, such as the prime business, we got some business from their clients. Look, they announced a big restructure and we wish them well. It is important for the banking system for there to be many players who are strong. I think with this restructuring, hopefully Credit Suisse is on a good upward trend and regains the prominence it used to have. I think it talked me about the human errors, the recession we have been talking about and how much that cost you. There was also, I don't know if it is punishments coming or some steps towards the people that did those mistakes. Where are we on that? We had an ovarishance of securities in the US. It was completely avoidable. It was one of these embarrassing moments you hate to have when you receive your bank. It is, however, it was a human error in a very narrow way. We have done both and had an external investigation on it and internal investigation. We have made good by all the clients affected. We have had a settlement with the SEC. We cooperated from the first minute fully with all our regulators and we dealt with the matter internally. We are in the final stages now where individuals who were affected or involved in this are being assessed. We have got a standard process by which we do that. There will be implications for certain individuals, but that process will play itself. Through your strategy.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1116,2022-11-20 07:23:36
18503," We've got a standard process by which we do that. And yes, there will be implications for certain individuals, but that process will play itself. Thank you. I mean, through your strategy, we talked a little bit about the global economy. Do you worry that this wave of inflation is just going to get worse? When will we reach peak inflation? When will we know that we've reached peak inflation? You will know that the rate of change of inflation is stabilizing when the central banks start signalling it that in their rate rises. Going away from 75 basis points, 100 basis points, to something more normal and natural. Now, mathematically, there will be some forces that will bring inflation down just because base effects as they call them. And I expect that will happen sometime in the middle of next year. Is there a danger that central banks messes up that they raise interest rates too much? Look, there's always a finally calibrated issue about when do you stop? And I think many people have sort of raised two worries. One is that there's a sort of supply chain led element of this. There's an energy shock element of this. Employment is at all time highs, relatively speaking. And that people have not seen such a hiking cycle in three decades. Having said that, I think the officials are all across the world are all very, very experienced. And I think they'll find the right way to calibrate it. How difficult is it in this uncertain environment, frankly, to calibrate where you want to grow businesses geographically in the world? Well, I'll speak for Barclays. You know, we've got a real strength of the business in the US and the UK. We've got a good investment bank in Europe and a trading business. We had caught at an island, but caught a large trading presence in France. And then good presence in Asia, both in the Middle East and India. We've got an excellent investment banking franchise and Singapore and Hong Kong. I expect that footprint to remain broadly as it is. We have some very interesting partnerships in Australia. We might do some others. But I expect the broad footprint to be as it is. The geopolitical complexities, which are also rising, makes people more cautious also about which countries they want to go to. Have you had to increase wages? And I'm not really thinking of the high-flyer bankers, but just to match inflation in most of these places. So we did a fairly large program of wage rises in India, where we've got a large number of employees last year in 2021. In the UK, we did an interim adjustment in August of about 4% for a lot of our workers. And then we are working through another one for the end of this year. And we did one in the US also late last year. So I think inflation, especially as it affects some of our workers, we're going to have to look at it and we're going to have to respond. When you look at the return to the office, I think you, bankers, have to be back four days a week. How's that going? It's going well, look. I think we always have to create a balance. There's a level of flexibility that's come into work life into the workplace since COVID, which I think is good. I think some of the stigma attached to working from home has gone away. And I think that's really important, especially for those who are managing young families or have other pressures that require them to spend more time at home or close to home. And I think we should continue that and should continue that in important ways. Some jobs require you to be in the office. Our trading flows are largely full five days a week. And that's the way it should be. Our bank branches here in London also need to be stuffed, and they should be. And for some other functions, it can be less. But I do think it's important for people in all functions at all levels to be in the office. This isn't a apprenticeship business at the end of the day. And it's important to have that productivity from being face to face. When you look at the strength and dollar, I mean, this could be a shorter term.

What does it mean for Berkley's? Well, as a financial matter, it's actually good. We have about 40% of our revenues in dollars. We've got a fairly big business in the US. More broadly, though, I mean world economies will have to adjust. And that adjustment process can be painful. And you can see the pain it's inflicting in Europe and the UK. Export will be subsidised, but in poor prices go up. Thank you so much. Francine, thank you very much for having me. It is crucially important. And I think we've moved from this attitude, from its indulgence, a waste of time, almost an illness that needs a cure. For something as universally important to human life as sleep, mysteries surrounding its necessity and utility have only just been recently uncovered. Some of our biggest discoveries were in the 1970s or 1980s, and so it makes that a really exciting field, because it seems as though we're uncovering new insights each and every day. Some scientists are going further to find out how sleep and what happens there can be harnessed to further expand our understanding. It's easy to memorize things that makes you smart. If you can spit back a lot of facts. But if you want to be wise, if you really want wisdom, you've got to know when and how and why to use that information.

18505," And does that happen a lot of times when the prices are going up? She was a federal prosecutor going after gangs and the mob before being handed for next assignment, taking down Bitcoin. Katie Hawn soon realized this new technology was much more than a tool used by criminals. She dove deep and became a crypto convert, swapping her prosecutor hat for a board seat at Coinbase, and became the first female general partner at Venture Firm and Recent Horror Whites. Hawn, now a prolific crypto investor, recently launched her own fund with one and a half billion dollars to deploy. It's the largest fund ever raised by a single investor. Joining me on this edition of Bloomberg Studio 1.0, CEO and founder of Hawn Ventures, Katie Hawn. Katie, it's so great to have you. Great to be back here in the studio with you Emily. I want to start with a vibe check. Okay. What state of the crypto cycle are we in right now? It was hot. Yep. And then it got pretty cold. Well look Emily, zooming back because I've been in crypto for a decade if you can believe it. We've seen crypto be really hot and then all of a sudden not. And so we've seen this before. However, I think one of the things that's a little bit different now is with each new crypto cycle, more and more people come into it. And so it's more and more pronounced each cycle. And I would push back on it's not. I think it depends on what area of the ecosystem you're looking at. We think developers think crypto and Web3 is still really hot. I am seeing a lot less of those. We're all going to make it. Yeah. Hashtags. I'm seeing a lot less of them too. Although I am spending less time on Twitter. So maybe that's why. But with each cycle, there are new acronyms. What hasn't happened is a crypto winter in the midst of kind of really serious global macro conditions. So we have inflation kind of at record highs for our generation in our lifetime. And then we have also a war that's broken out in the Ukraine. And we have a number of other factors going on here. So that's very different. There was some serious carnage out there. Socius, Luna, three hours. What's been your takeaways from? Yeah. I don't want to sit here and tell you that algorithmic stablecoins are bad because I actually think they're really interesting. However, I think what happened is you had, in this case, you mentioned Luna and Tara, you know, that was an algorithmic stablecoin that was getting pretty widespread adoption relative to what the tech could do. I didn't realize you spent your teenage years living in Egypt and learning Arabic. Tell me about your upbringing. I was always uprooted. My dad worked for a large company and we were always moving just when I would get comfortable in one space. And I think actually that's pretty important. If you fast toward and look at my career, I'm comfortable being in uncomfortable situations. You know, I was didn't know a lot about venture when I got into it initially. I didn't know a lot about crypto when I got into it initially. And I was okay asking questions. I was okay not knowing the local acronyms or the Namanclature of a particular field. And I'm, you know, I'm taken right back to my teenage years in Cairo, moving from Houston, Texas one day to downtown Maddie in Cairo the next day. You studied law. I did. You clerked for Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy. That's right. You became a federal prosecutor. You were taking on prison gangs and the mafia. That must have taken a really thick skin. I was doing it at each 25. And now if I kind of take a step back and you I think that happens at different points in your career. Like, whoa, if I would have analyzed that a little more at the time. And I'm kind of in some ways glad I didn't. I just dove right in. Because I found it fascinating. There was a human aspect to it and people's stories. And I felt like those stories mattered. So I was drawn to criminal law and became a federal prosecutor. And I did cases involving violent crime. But then really mistriing cases. Being back in the courtroom, being before the grand jury. Like the prosecutor you would see on TV going to try those murder cases. Doing those two hour closing arguments. That's right. And so moved out here to California. I intended the largest prison gang in the world at the time. Um, outlaw.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1119,2022-11-20 07:36:39
18506," going to try those murder cases. Doing those two-hour closing arguments. That's right. And so moved out here to California. I died at the largest prison gang in the world at the time. At La Motorcycle Gangs, hostage taking, bank robberies, armed bank robberies. There was really not a kind of criminal case by that point in my career. I hadn't done it. It was right around that time, 2012. One of my bosses came in and said, let's have that same energy that you brought to those gang cases to those murder cases. And let's go ahead and have you investigate this new criminal technology that we really need to look into and possibly shut this down. So you created the first cryptocurrency task force? How would you describe it? Fortunately, several of us in the government realized at the time, it's not possible, also not desirable. Because Bitcoin is not an entity. It's not a person. Right? It's a protocol. And it would be like saying, let's go shut down cash. Let's go shut down the internet. It's not possible. Probably wouldn't be a good idea, either. I was using crypto and technologies like the Bitcoin blockchain, because that's all it existed then. This is 2012, 2013, to actually uncover criminal activity. So I didn't think that that technology was bad. Frankly, it was a tool that helped me uncover the various activity. And by the way, it was a step level function improvement better than compliance by banks. I'll just go ahead and say it. That's a little bit controversial. But I had spent a decade subpoenaing large financial institutions. And five times out of 10 didn't get back what I needed. One case I worked on, and people always say, oh, you shut down the Silk Road. What actually happened? I was looking into something completely, not having to do with anything at all of the Silk Road, and came across some what looked to be some kind of odd activity. And it turns out that a couple of federal agents on the Silk Road Task Force out of Washington, DC were cropped. And that is the case that I ended up inditing, and I ended up prosecuting those agents, and they both went to prison. So that's the aspect of what the Silk Road case that I worked on. I would never, never have been able to uncover that criminal activity by those agents, because they were federal agents. They knew how to cover their tracks. Had they not used Bitcoin blockchain. So that technology right there, if they had just used wires or cash or bank wires, we would never have uncovered that. Just how hard is it to launch a crypto fund from scratch?

How did you and coin base and Brian Armstrong come together? I hosted an event here in San Francisco at the Federal Reserve Bank. I believe it was there that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1120,2022-11-20 07:41:02
18507," Do you and Coinbase and Brian Armstrong come together? I hosted an event here in San Francisco at the Federal Reserve Bank, and believe it was there that it wasn't just Brian, it was a lot of what I'll call legitimate actors and crypto who wanted to usher in this new wave, this new ecosystem. And then we brought together the heads of all kinds of agencies. Really in an effort to kind of talk about building bridges, you know, the government and the crypto industry. We're never going to see eye to eye on a lot of things, but we did think there were some commonalities. Coinbase is a company that has suffered, they've been losing share, the valuation of public markets has plummeted. Why do you think that is and how do you think it can be fixed? Yeah, well I think again a few things it's tied to. One, a large aspect of Coinbase's business now, of course, is trading revenue. And that's down when prices are down. And you know, the company's been very transparent about that long before going public. I mean, also if you look at its S1, it specifically identifies that. And just how volatile crypto cycles are. So I think that's part of it. It's judged, you know, by public markets as a technology stock or as a financial services company. By the way, I think it's both. I think it's not just a financial services company. I think it's so much more. I think it's really a portal to this whole new ecosystem. You were also on the board of OpenC until recently, there's an insider trading situation or accusation going on there. Coinbase has also had employees accused of insider trading. How much is this happening within crypto companies and within the industry and how big a problem is? Yeah, I think crypto is under the microscope. So where you have a case, two cases, three cases in crypto ecosystem, which now is a trillion dollar industry. I think multi-billion approaching trillion dollar industry, you're always going to be able to find examples like that. So I don't want to make too much out of a handful of cases. That said, the company Coinbase OpenC, take these things incredibly seriously. Along with your position at Coinbase, you became a partner at one of the most story venture capital firms in Silicon Valley. That is Andreson Harwitz. What was your experience at A16Z-like? There I met Chris Dixon and I met Ben Horwitz and I met Mark Andreson. And I had worked with them for just about a year, maybe a little bit over when they asked me to come and co-run their crypto funds at Andreson Harwitz. Again, I jumped at that chance and I think really that speaks to the fact that, as I said before, things are a hell yes or there are no. And it was a hell yes for me. So Andreson Harwitz is the kind of place where if you make partner, you don't leave. Yeah. How did Mark and Ben respond when you said, yeah, I want to leave to start a crypto fund of my own. As you might know, Emily, they're an anchor. They're an anchor check into my fund and I'm very grateful for that. You know, Mark and Chris and folks like them are also personal LPs. So I felt very supported when I shared that decision. And I will say that it was not running away from Andreson Harwitz. It was running to another opportunity. And you know, crypto is not, what do they say? It's not a spectator sport. It's like, you're in it. It excuse very young. It's 24-7. It's global. And it's hustle. And at this, and that's a trade-off. It's a life trade-off. And at this point in my career and in my life, if I was going to continue to make that trade-off, I just wanted to do it and do it in a way that was really true to me. So you struck out on your own to launch on ventures. What gave you the courage to do that? What was the spark that lit the fire? Yeah. That got you to say, I need to do this and do this now. Sure. What I set out to do was to continue to invest in this ecosystem that I think is so broad that decision was very purposeful and the timing was very purposeful. We have an early stage fund that does seed stage, series A, even series B. And then we have what we call an acceleration fund, which is not a growth fund. It's a crypto-growth fund. And I think those are different things. But it's later stage. It might be crypto-publics. Certain kinds of public tokens were set up to hold tokens and participate in the token ecosystem. Or later stage companies. I mean, there are now several crypto, many crypto unicorns. Space has become really competitive. Even though you say, crypto's had its kind of ups and downs, the thing is, a lot of people in some of those last cycles have seen the kind of venture style returns that can be having crypto. And so you've had a lot of new funds enter the space. And that's driven up competition. So what?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1121,2022-11-20 07:45:33
18508," seen the kind of venture style returns that can be having crypto. And so you've had a lot of new funds enter the space and that's driven up competition. So what differentiates on ventures then from you know all of these other crypto funds or even the more traditional venture capitalists like entries in Harrowitz or Sequoia they also have crypto funds. Sure. Well I think a lot of traditional venture capital funds now have crypto funds. It used to just be like a regulatory designation. I was like are you an RIA which is registered investment advisor. I would say for crypto founders today it's not enough to just be an RIA right. They frankly I don't even know if a lot of them care that's a regulatory designation. What crypto founders today want to know is do you live and breathe crypto? Do you inhale the discourse? Are you part of the community? Do you participate in governance? Are you going to be staking these kind of crypto verbs out there? And if you're not really in this space full time I think it's very hard to run a successful crypto fund. We don't have a hedge fund component. So we're not sitting here buying and trading and selling that's a hedge fund structure and there are crypto hedge funds. We're not one. We're making seven to ten year bets. Just how hard is it to launch a crypto fund from scratch? You know it's hard but it's not impossible. We don't have a crystal ball. I don't know. I can't predict cycles but I knew that we were in a cycle where you saw so much for an excitement around the space and I already talked about what makes this different but I think one thing also is we are a nimble strike force. We don't fish in the same pond. We have the crypto natives. We have efficient execution. We have operators, seasoned operators who really know how to stick the landing and I think that's reflected on our culture. I would say the only thing that's changed in our strategy as a result of the market correction is really more of a focus on early stage but we still have our late stage fund. I'm one we see valuations which I think will still see correct. Spoiler. I think we'll continue to see some corrections and so we might deploy our later stage fund a little bit more slowly. It might not be on an even 50-50 cadence and that's okay. Long-term our strategy hasn't changed. Long-term we're committed to this space. How much do you think valuations are going to correct? You know it's just I can't give you a one-size-fits-all answer because crypto is not a monolith. You have some crypto companies that really follow more of an enterprise-sass business model. You have others that are layer one protocols. You have still others that are consumer-facing applications and I think one of the things we're seeing right now is the infrastructure layer and that's where we're spending a lot of our time by the way and we think more and more use cases will come about when the infrastructure layers in place. So my own view is we are not rushing to deploy. We're certainly not getting caught up. You get VC FOMO and I try not to deploy that. You know look I think it's very easy to get into that mindset right. It's because it's a competitive sport. It's a competitive space and I think I'd be lying if I said that that doesn't influence anyone. I try to what I do and I think I do differently is I try to take stock of that. Oh that's the FOMO mentality kicking in. That's bad. Again you don't want to over-correct though. What we look for is we look for amazing founders. It doesn't matter if I think valuations will correct if they're amazing founders. There's a huge tam. We also look for what's your regulatory plan. If you're launching a token what's your plan to comply with the law? What's your plan for security by the way? We've seen a lot of hacks in the space. We've want to really dive in there and make sure that the founders have been thoughtful about especially if they're custody and customer funds keeping those funds secure. If it's a cross-chain bridge what are the exploits? Have you changed your strategy at all given the downturn? What have you backed out of any deals? We have decided not to do certain deals because the conditions have changed. Don't you raise the phone? We have decided not to do certain deals. We've never backed out of a deal. We have decided not to do a few deals because we think that pricing was ahead of progress candidly. We might have been wrong about that Emily. We might have been wrong about that but I think if we were wrong not to do a couple of deals better that we might have been right because if we were wrong about that I think we can find a way to still invest in those projects later. Well one thing I'm hearing is that a lot of dry powder has just sacked up because all these funds raised a lot of money raised. What was the biggest fund ever for a single person, not just a woman? Yeah. Anyone? Are you confident you're going to have to put all that money on? I am but if I don't have a place to put it I'm not just going",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1122,2022-11-20 07:49:50
18509," The biggest fund ever for a single person, not just a woman. Anyone. Yep. Are you confident you're going to have to put a place to put all that money on? I am, but if I don't have a place to put it, I'm not just going to go willing, nearly deploy it. One of the things that we told our LPs, even during the period when we raised our fund, which was when crypto was undeniably still on a bull run, we said that we are going to be pretty steadfast sticking to a tear deployment cycle. And I think one thing that's changed is that might have lengthened. It certainly hasn't shortened, but we will, again, we have, we feel very good that we have the capital to back great teams when we see them. So you think we're going to fall behind the United States?

We buy our content from Waldgarden's without digital scarcity, which is what NFTs unlock. You don't really own anything. You're subject to the whims of a platform. I think NFTs and digitally scarce goods fundamentally change that. I think you'll see NFTs back again. We are spending a lot of time in the infrastructure layer. Like I tell you, zero knowledge, technology, scalability. We think of that as the plumbing. If you think of the fiber-hubbic cables. Remember, you couldn't have had YouTube and Netflix with dial-up. You couldn't have streamed content. The same is true of crypto use cases. We think that there will be a lot of new use cases unlocked when the infrastructure is there, when it's more efficient, when it's more user-friendly. And so we're spending a lot of our time there. President Biden issues this crypto executive order. There are a number of ports that are coming due. What do you want to see from the administration when it comes to regulation? Are you optimistic that we will get there? Yeah. We were so delighted to see that executive order. It's not something you should normally be delighted about. But why we were is because it was to us a real recognition that this is a US government saying this field isn't going anywhere. This field is growing. It's growing so much that we are going to direct every single agency in the federal government to come up with a plan here. I think we take a step forward, but then you see we're a big government. We're a big system. We have states. We have local entities. So we take a step forward with the EO. And then we take some steps back sometimes, too. And I think what I see is crypto founders are confused by that. They're starting to think, well, I could go to this jurisdiction where there's a single regulator. And you don't have 50 states with different rules. It's the US government that needs to start taking stock of the fact that right now, Emily in China, there's a quarter of a billion ECNY wallets, a quarter of a billion. We're still talking about whether there should be a government central bank digital currency. We're still studying that. So you think we're going to fall behind the United States? I think we already are falling behind. Fall behind China. We're falling behind. We're the data.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1123,2022-11-20 07:54:09

And we're falling behind. What are the dangers of falling behind China? And the rest of the world. This is years ahead. So I don't want people to take a headline and say, oh, I think the US dollar will be no longer the global currency, reserve global currency. I'm not saying that now. But fast forward decades. And if you no longer need to use the dollar because you have an alternative, I think that's a real problem. What would we use instead? Well, I think that there are going to be stable coins out there that people who have access to a smartphone will use. There is a demand for it. We see our 285% year-over-year growth with stable coins. So people are clearly liking the idea of this. Now, again, there have been some spectacular failures too, but not all stable coins are created the same. But I think the important thing is that we really do need to not just quash innovation. What do you think of how Gary Gensler, the chair of the SEC, and how he's approaching it? One of the things that I hear from founders is that they're very confused because they get told, come in, register. Just come in and talk to us. But you have the one company who's done the ultimate act of going in and registering coinbase, filed an S1. And still, you know, there's a lot of saber rattling still going on, I think. And again, I don't want to single out the SEC. And I don't want to suggest that anything they're doing is bad. I do think, though, that right now there's a lot of confusion. And one of the pieces of confusion stems from the fact that, you know, and it started with the ICO Mania back in what, 2016, 2017, I can't even remember which year now, where the SEC was very loud about securities. A lot of them were securities, but the space has changed. And so to still view it through the ICO lens, when so much has happened over the last five years in the space, I think is a mistake. What do you have to say to the skeptics out there who just don't believe in the future of Web3? And don't see where this is going. Yeah. I would say don't judge the current state of innovation by the end state of innovation. I hear from a lot of these skeptics. And by the way, I'm friends with a lot of these skeptics too. I don't only want to live in a crypto bubble. They want to see the use cases, especially if they're not technical. Well, when am I going to use it? What will I use it for? And I think one of the things that's not appreciated is how quickly the infrastructure here is catching up. And once you have kind of a, once you have really scalable blockchains that can handle a lot of thorough put and are very efficient, I think that unlocks a whole lot of use cases. People are spending more time on screens. That curve is up and to the right. Whether we like it or not, that is the future. I mean, those who have kids know that kids spend more time online. They want digital things too. And I think to dismiss it, it is a bit generational. I do find not always, but it is a bit generational. If you talk to kids about being able to have money online, they instantly get that concept. They're comfortable not having to hold something in their hand to think it has value. Take us to the end state. Do Google and Amazon and Facebook and Apple still exist? I believe they will still exist. I mean, it depends what you talk about when you talk about the end state. I mean, I think that, you know, I think for decades, those companies will still be around, but the important thing is, I think this new ecosystem is going to represent a challenge to them. I do think that those entities, decentralized forces are coming and we'll cut into those entities, profits and revenues. So we have a little rapid fire section.

So thank you for being here. It's great to be here. You basically grew up in a restaurant as I understand it. What was it like leaving China moving to Illinois and starting this new life? It was a classic immigrant story. In many ways I would say looking back almost a fairy tale like Journey where you know my parents came to the US with $250 in the bank. We immigrated to Illinois, Champaign, or Banna. My dad got his degree at the University of Illinois. My mom put food on the table by working three jobs a day. One of which did happen to be in a Chinese restaurant where I moonlight it as a dishwasher. So I got to hang out with mom that way as a way of growing up and I did that. I mowed lawns and that's really kind of how I saved up money to you know buy Nintendo games and do all the things that were the wonders of my childhood. What do you think you learned from that you know mowing lawns early, washing dishes early? I think two things you know one looking backwards it's just that you have to work to actually get things done. I didn't understand what it meant to live off of food stamps to buy groceries or free and reduced lunch you know every day inside school. But it was a very empowering feeling to buy my own Nintendo or earn my way to buy my first Apple computer. The second thing was really just the power of independent thinking you know my parents because they were so busy just trying to make a life for our family that I was largely left alone. So I grew up playing basketball, watching TV that's how I learned English. I grew up moving around a lot as a kid and as a result I think that gave me a lot of time to realize that it's pretty important to think for yourself. So you studied engineering at Berkeley went to business school at Stanford and you actually started out as an intern at Square. I did. I can't tell you how many people have said to me Tony Shoe was my intern. That's where. Like that's how long I've been doing this and how you know Dordash just kind of came out of nowhere. Yeah I you know it was it was actually a pretty stiff competition between finishing school Jack Dorsey and Keith were trying to convince me to leave Stanford and work at Square full-time. It was a fun and busy period of my time but I enjoyed both. So how did the idea for Dordash come about and the decision to not work for you know Jack Dorsey in Square which I'm sure was also kind of intoxicating right. The idea for Dorash really came from this you know lifelong interest in helping these physical business owners really people like my mom. So we talked to hundreds of small business owners and it was surprising to us that even in 2013 delivery was not a solved problem. There were business owners who would show us literally booklets of delivery orders that they would refuse. I mean we were talking about thousands of dollars per week which is you know the difference sometimes between making payroll and and actually you know surviving and they would just turn them down because they were delivery orders which to us was a really novel and unfortunate phenomenon and frankly a necessary one and that really became you know the impetus to start Dorash. You started out driving for competitors right. I was driving for a lot of different services to try to actually understand you know logistics you know my background I mean as you mentioned more in engineering math I thought I was going to be a cancer researcher I mean that's pretty much what I spent all of my undergraduate days at Berkeley doing that kind of 180ed into world of business but and so I think it's really important to really learn things for yourself you know to think from first principles kind of you know again back to that independent thinking mindset I talked about as a child growing up. Did you try for Uber lift? I even drove for you know services that were a little bit older and services like FedEx or Domino's and really try to explore you know how does delivery work.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1126,2022-11-20 08:07:04
18513," You try for Uber or Lyft? I even drove for services that were a little bit older. And services like FedEx or Domino's and really try to explore, you know, how does delivery work? And it was really trying to understand, you know, every component part. I mean, it sounds really simple, right? Bring you a burrito from point A to point B, but there were actually 20 steps involved in that delivery. It just didn't appear as obvious to the naked eye. So the first two years of DoorDash's life, we did delivery almost every single day. So where did you go from there? I mean, I mean, early days I know Elon Musk has said starting a company is like swallowing glass and staring into the abyss of death. One of the first ones came actually as early as month three of the company's life. So we were maybe 11 weeks, 12 weeks old as a company. There was a big stand for football game in September. And, you know, long story short, we were laid on every single order. And we had no ability to turn off the site. So it was just horrendous. Everyone in the company, all 12 of us were delivering. And everyone, you know, rightfully so, was furious because of how lately we were. And so we had a decision to make, you know, do we do the right thing and refund, you know, every single customer, which would have cost us about 40% of our bank account? Or do we, you know, do a less right thing and survive another day? Because it was very hard for us at that time to raise capital, which, you know, was something true for DoorDash's early history. And, you know, it took us about 30 seconds to click, submit, refund. And, you know, the lesson for us always is a founding team. And frankly, even today, as a company, is we'd rather die chasing excellence than live to be mediocre. It wasn't so obvious either in the earlier years. I remember in 2016, you did a down-round. I think you actually came on the show around that time. How did you weather the doubters and the, you know, the people who didn't believe? There were about a thousand days in the desert between 2016, 17, and 18. Sometimes with company building, so long as you can convince yourself, because time is your, you know, most precious resource, you should keep going. And if you can keep going long enough, you might get lucky enough to make it. So over time, how did you balance quality with the need and desire to scale? And then scale globally? In these types of businesses where it's low margin, high complexity, you really have to figure out what your unit of business is. You know, for us, that was a city. So in order to, before going to 7,000 or 10,000 cities globally, we made one city work. And after city one worked, we made city two work. And after we started getting higher and higher confidence that we can make baskets of cities work irrespective of the geographies or what, you know, the customer situation looked like or what the merchant makeup was, then we gained the confidence to actually roll out everywhere. Then came the pandemic. Brian Chesky has said the pandemic was like a torpedo for Airbnb. Was it like the opposite for DoorDash? It was like the biggest wave behind her back, which, you know, had the ability to break us. And it almost did because we grew two X in two weeks. We went from a singular US restaurant delivery business. That's what you and I would be talking about in 2019 to today five businesses in 27 countries, you know, much more than just restaurants. And so all of that was created in the last two years. The big question is how much do customers keep ordering out in a high inflation environment? What do you think of when you think of a battery? For most, it's what we use to power devices for both work and play and maybe even your car. Over the past few decades, they've gotten way more powerful, long-lasting and affordable. But all of this is just a prologue to what the next batteries are going to do. As we drive to an increasingly renewable power-driven grid, we also need to be able to store energy and release it later to cover those periods of weather intermittencies that are driving this new grid that we're in. It's a multi-trillion dollar opportunity, and it's imperative that we figure out the solution here. How we store energy on a massive scale.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1127,2022-11-20 08:11:21
18514," It's a multi trillion dollar opportunity and it's imperative that we figure out the solution here. How we store energy on a massive scale is in many ways the central challenge of the fight to stop climate change. You will shed light on dark matter. You will make aging optional. You will turn 5G up to 11 because when you subscribe to Bloomberg you won't just get news. You'll get insight into limitless possibilities, knowledge and inspiration to feed your ambition. So before you invent pioneer disrupt, before you change the world, Bloomberg. DoorDash went public, middle of the pandemic and I remember actually you were coming on Bloomberg and the price doubled at the open. We were coming out obviously. Terrible economic times, you know, the depths of the pandemic. What did that feel like? When you're going out into the world starting to sell to public investors and the price just doubles. It was certainly very exciting. It was exhilarating. It was the first time that our company went public. The first time that I had ever undergone any of those experiences before. But in the back of my head it was that saying that you're never as good or as bad as they say you are. So just remember that. So tease that out for me a little bit because the big question is how much do customers keep ordering out in a high inflation environment? How much long-term sustainability and growth is there really? Even though COVID is now effectively sustained and we understand how to live with it, customers are continuing to order. Those that join us during the pandemic, they're still ordering out about the same rights as those who joined us before the pandemic. And that's because eating out and getting things delivered are pretty complimentary. On the second point around inflation, you know, I can say that in the last 60 years in looking at the data, spend in restaurants and in grocery have only declined in two of those 60 years, including high inflationary times, much higher than what we observed today. And so what I think I take, you know, solace in even though I see the fact that there is high inflation is that customers are going to continue spending on food. And our job is to bring greater and greater affordability. More broadly the economy is in a tough position. Your competitors have announced layoffs and hiring freezes and slowdowns. Is DoorDash considering any of these? I think we've been fortunate mostly because most of our investments that happened during the pandemic really were meant to build new businesses. And those new businesses have continued to grow. New business is, you know, beyond restaurants and categories like grocery convenience or retail. New businesses overseas, you know, we announced a large acquisition in Volt, where that really helped double our overall addressable market to 700 million people. New businesses in building and advertising business, new businesses expanding our services and building a platform to help businesses build their own digital operations. Do you see DoorDash as more of a super app of the future or is it something different? Well, I see DoorDash as really solving two problems. And a problem one is how do we bring incremental demand to all the physical businesses as they kind of figure out their own digital in house capabilities. And the second problem we're trying to solve is bring tools to these businesses. There's still a lot of competition in delivery. Who do you think survives the delivery wars? Who doesn't and why? Well, delivery is a scale economy's game. You know, at the end of the day, you can survive even doing deliveries from a singular story. You know, there's still mom and pop pizza shops and Chinese restaurants that do their own delivery. Do you see DoorDash as a challenger to like Walmart, Amazon? Well, I see DoorDash, you know, as a champion of local businesses and physical businesses. I don't think that a world in which we just get what we want to buy or consume for a few places is a world that again is as worth enjoying living in. It's our job is to make sure that all of these businesses, all of the millions of physical businesses globally can continue to compete. I do a lot of DoorDash, helps me be a working mom. Whenever I interview you, I get pings from dashers. And some of them say they don't get paid enough. Some of them seem pretty angrily.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1128,2022-11-20 08:15:42
18515," Dash helps me be a working mom. Whenever I interview you, I get pings from dashers. And some of them say they don't get paid enough. Some of them seem pretty angry. What's your response to them? We want the local economy to grow and to thrive. That includes dashers. We have 3 million dashers that come to the platform every single quarter. And so it's really important to me what they say. And it's in fact why the company, myself included, we still dash due deliveries. In other words, once a month. You still do deliveries once a month? It's why we have a Dasher community council that we started three, four years ago now. I want to see one of your memos after a delivery. Are you like sending notes to the head? It's not even after the delivery. I'm texting, you know, well, not texting while I'm driving, but texting after I complete the order. From your deliveries, what have you learned? Everything. All of the details, everything from pay considerations, everything from operations that a store, you know, which stores are a bit faster in their operations or more consistent, which stores are less consistent. Where do you find the last parking space in downtown San Francisco? All of these details matter. They matter for efficiency. They matter for driver pay. They matter for merchant earnings. And so as a result, you know, what I say to dashers is, please continue to talk to me. I'm just Tony at DoorDash. Always trying to, you know, make things better. We're not saying that we're perfect, but when we look at, you know, the data that we've collected, you know, the average dashers making $24.25 an hour nationwide when they're on, when they're doing deliveries. And so, and most dashers are pretty satisfied. So DoorDash has been expanding internationally. Sounds like you're on the road a lot. I'm on the road. I am on the road. US, Canada, Australia, Japan. Where else? Where next? Germany, you know, Israel, Finland, a lot of the Nordics. So we're in 27 countries. And a lot of that is run by, you know, the VULT team that we were lucky to partner with. Beyond VULT, how are you thinking about M&A? Are there any verticals or areas in particular where you might be interested in acquiring? You know, we have five businesses, the US restaurants business, the new categories business with a focus on convenience and grocery. Non-US International 27 countries are B2B business and are ads business. So we have quite a full plate. On M&A specifically, it's a high bar. M&A I think sometimes looks a lot better on paper than can be achieved in reality. And I think it's because you're talking about, at the end of the day, combining human organizations, not just businesses or products or lines on a spreadsheet. I think you have to deliver upon that promise. And so for us, the bar isn't just does it add to our business, but does it actually add to our culture? You've been piloting rapid delivery, right? Rapid delivery. But rapid delivery seems to be contracting. What are you seeing in your pilots? Is this somewhere you think you'll expand or no? So I think customers are always going to have expectations that go in one direction, right? I don't think we're going to want things delivered more slowly over time, or at higher prices, or with less selection. Our core use case right now is Lunch and Dinner, which is highly repetitive, highly profitable, which allows us to invest in things like fast deliveries. I take that with great pride. I also take with great responsibility, remembering to invest in those who maybe don't come from privileged backgrounds. Japan's critical role in the global economy is changing as the world recalibrates. After decades of stagnation, Japan's leaders are forging a more innovative and sustainable path forward to revitalize the nation. Corporate giants, policymakers and pioneers tell us how they're doing just that.

18516," music on the David Rubenstein Show here to peer conversations I uncover the untold stories of the world's most successful leaders watch Wednesdays on Bloomberg Television You bought chow botics last year but shut it down, this is robotics robotic kiosks, right? I'm curious how you're thinking about AI and uber shut down itself driving stuff and they've started it back up How are you thinking about AI and moonshots and some of this potential new technology and how it could help door dash or not? Like is it just not ready for prime time? When it comes to platform shifts or new technologies, AI, autonomy, you know, other types of technologies I tend to like to make the investment I think that's a more appropriate choice to not miss the shift However, I think it's very important to get the pacing right I still think that the merits behind what we were trying to do in partnership with the chow botics team was the right idea in which we can help restaurants effectively build you know, a cheaper cost product that's ultimately what we were trying to do but we weren't ready yet with the technology You recently joined Meta's board what's it like working with Mark Zuckerberg? It's been fantastic, you know, it's been a terrific learning experience you know, learning from Mark all the way to the incredible management team at that company it has a broad mandate of different products and as well as initiatives and it's been a privilege Facebook had a better, you know, very controversial platform there's, you know, controversy about whether Facebook is really good for the world whether Facebook should have as much power as it should how do you think about that and how are you advising Mark about how to use that power? With great power comes great responsibility and I think Facebook has a lot of influence and Meta's, you know, different properties as, you know, I'm sure you cover, you know, serve billions of people, you know, every single day and that's an enormous privilege and an enormous responsibility that they take incredibly seriously Like should any company be more powerful than multiple governments combined? I don't think I see it, you know, exactly that way right, because it's still a contract between, between, you know, the company and its users and I think what's important for Meta to do and they're doing this absolutely is how do we set the guardrails, you know, to make it fair, safe for everyone and this is very, very, very difficult You're also an investor and a number of different startups one of them is Alchemy, Web3 company Yes Any plans to accept crypto? Any plans for DoorDash to accept crypto? Crypto right now is going through a period where it's trying to, you know, figure out what's next in terms of its use case, you know, I think everyone myself included very bullish on the technology of what the blockchain enables What do you think could be the future of blockchain technology in food delivery, in delivery, in general? Well, I don't know if it's going to get applied directly, you know, to food or to delivery, I mean, I think, you know, it absolutely has the potential to create a new economic infrastructure Right? An economic infrastructure that can really serve as the basis for new banking systems and et cetera And so I think that's something more that's tangential to the world of delivery Obviously payments is one part of what we do, but it's not the central thing So we're going to do a little rapid fire now a little quicker, fun, questions, favorite food I've ordered from 1100 different DoorDash restaurants Wow So I actually like to try everything Your business idol There are people in retail that I've admired, you know, the people that founded everything from Walmart to Costco The team in Amazon, you know, in e-commerce, the team Elon Musk and what he's trying to do What about Elon Musk by Twitter?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1130,2022-11-20 08:24:20
18517," the team in Amazon, you know, in e-commerce. The team, Elon Musk and what he's trying to do. What about Elon Musk by Twitter? If he has time to run a third company, I think that'd be fantastic for the world. You grew up in Illinois. Yeah. You live in California. You like basketball. Yeah. You're your favorite team. Bulls. Bulls, not warriors. I grew up in the golden days of Michael Jordan, you know, Scottie Pippin and actually, you know, both the early 90s as well as the later 90s in which they won three in a row. I'm still a Bulls die hard even though we're in the rough patch right now. I hear you also like to run. You run marathons? Well, I don't run marathons today. So just to be clear, but I do run every day. So that's been my sanctuary, if you will, for the past 10 years. Your kids are still pretty young. How do you think having kids has changed you as a leader? You know, I think kids are amazing in that they're experiencing the world for the first time. Being able to listen versus to, you know, talk at or to dictate an opinion, you know, I think that's been, you know, a big lesson. I think the second one is the power of curiosity, you know, kids, especially my kids at their ages of two and four are asking the question, why a lot? And I think it's the best question. And it's so hard to answer because, you know, it requires clarity of thinking on everything, on the most basic things to more complicated things. How has being an Asian American CEO impacted your experience? Well, I think being an Asian growing up where I was the only Asian, and that was kind of my experience in Illinois, certainly had a big experience. And where it very directly, you know, I saw firsthand, you know, whether it was bullying or discrimination. But I think if I were to more broadly classify that to the privileged position that I'm in today, I'm still a minority in the sense that there aren't as many Asian American CEOs or founders as maybe founders from other backgrounds. And so I think it's that reminder to, you know, one always recognize that. And then I think secondly to always keep the underdog mentality. Do you think you faced more challenges than others? Because Asian American CEOs are so underrepresented. I mean, Asian Americans are underrepresented in leadership roles in tech. Full stop. I can't say that, you know, for me personally, you know, in building DoorDash, was that the experience? But look, I think it's, you're writing calling out that when I look around me, I want to look at especially public company, founder CEOs, well, hey, there aren't that many. Be when you start filtering for, you know, those from Asian descent. It's a much, much smaller list. And so I take that with, you know, great pride. I also take it with great responsibility. Really, and then again, remembering to invest in those who maybe don't come from privileged backgrounds, giving them an equal shot at it and to always to stay so hungry. You change your name to Tony when you moved. Well, that's five, yeah. To the US, you're five years old. After Tony Danza, who was the star of who's the boss? Correct. I loved that. I did. You know, no one could pronounce my Chinese name. And so I said, okay, well, let's just make it easier. Yeah. And so I walked with my dad to the immigration office and legally changed my name. Did life change? Did it feel like life changed after that? It felt a lot easier to say, hi, I'm Tony. What's it like being the boss now? Honestly, I think I don't see myself that way. And I recognize that that's probably not how others view me. But I really view myself as a teammate. And, you know, for me, I think it's trying to make that actually true. Make the reality of how I feel, true to the perception that maybe others have of me as the boss and making that distance shorter and shorter.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1131,2022-11-20 08:28:36
18518," Music Welcome to the world of decentralized finance. Bloomberg's covering all things crypto, the people, the transactions and the technology. Bloomberg crypto Tuesdays. No one covers the world like Bloomberg. The writings on the wall for the bank of England just stock oil has spray painted the current oil. Recessioning in Europe, UK and possibly the US. The global business authority. Back in 1997, I was interested in the following question, which is there are a bunch of dinosaurs called Saurapod dinosaurs, which had really long skinny necks. I made a computer model that showed that the tail of these Saurapod dinosaurs could actually act like a whip. The way a bull whip makes that cracking noise is because the tip of the whip actually goes about twice the speed of sound. And that crack is a sonic boom. I think the way they got a date was to impress the females by making loud booms. My guest this week has been described as one of the greatest English soccer strikers of all time. As a player, Gary Linnaker scored 48 goals for England and nearly 250 for English clubs. Since leaving the pitch, he's become the face of football coverage here in the UK and is a big vocal presence on social media. When I sat down with him ahead of the World Cup, I wanted to ask him about concerns to do with Qatar's human rights record, the lights of David Beckham doing deals with the state and why footballers can never win. Gary thank you so much for being here. Pleasure. Lovely to have you. Thank you. And it's an interesting time to talk to you because normally before a World Cup, there would be a lot of the usual feelings, excitement, trepidation, this feels quite different because of the controversy around where it is. Believe you me, this is the same before every World Cup. There are different levels of it and this is high level but you can go back. You go back to 1934 if you want and when the World Cup was in Italy and it was used as a vehicle to...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1132,2022-11-20 08:32:52
18519," But you can go back. You go back to 1934 if you want. And when the World Cup was in Italy, it was used as a vehicle to promote fascism for Mussolini. So this is not new. Brazil in 2014. We were all, there were riots on the streets by people in Brazil saying they shouldn't spend all this money on the stadiums. They should spend it on social care. Russia who invaded Crime here just a few years before they hosted the World Cup. So it's not something we're in accustomed to. Do you think it's on a different scale though because some of the reports of course about the number of lives that have been lost in the building of the stadium and the preparations? I think what makes this different is not just in terms of human rights and obviously workers' rights and what happened to them and lots of lives were lost. In the building of stadium I think what is really different about this one is that we know when the bid was proved to be successful that it was corrupt. So I think that's what perhaps separates this from the rest. Human rights wise, well there's a few countries that have hosted it that would fail some tests on that. Let's go to that in a minute but on the FIFA point because the former FIFA president, CEP Blatter, has now said it was a mistake. He waited a long time to do that. I mean not in the clearest thing. I couldn't tell him that the minute he opened the thing that said CETAR on it. Do you think there's any value in that statement at this point or is it just pointless to hear it? I just don't understand why I would do that now. I don't know if that helps or hinders or what. He's the ex president of FIFA at a time where there was a lot of dodgy goings on. So yes it was a mistake but it was more than a mistake wasn't it really. Well I mean also FIFA just having put out this email. Let's not focus on the politics. Let's focus on the football. Do you think FIFA has learned as a body about what's the important factor? I do believe that the current, I should maybe I'm being naive, I do believe the current people in charge of FIFA. And it includes awesome vendors in a really high role. I have certain amount of faith and trust that awesome thing is a decent, upstanding non corrupt person. So I don't think there are levels of corruption if there are any. There will be in certain branches of FIFA because it goes it's global and but in terms of the very top I think it's much more transparent. The voting system is much more transparent and there's less corruption. Do they still make mistakes? Yes they do. In terms of things that they said and that the thing you just mentioned was very tone deaf to say that because there's no question that this is kind of sports washing. But the reason sports washing works is when you are told to shut up about everything else and just say we're just stick to the football. So I think that was an era and I think it was a tone deaf statement and I think it's something that most of the federations will probably argue against. Some of the players we've heard might be wearing arm bands in support of LGBTQ players and people around the world. Do you think we should hear more from the players themselves? Well I think it's really interesting isn't it because the minute players stand up and voice their concerns everyone sells them, stay out of politics, stick to football. When they don't stand up and say something people say why aren't you saying anything. So there's an element of the footballers that can't win on this. They're inextricably linked politics and sport all sport. There's no getting away from that fact. Politicians will use football when it suits them. So if England start doing well and say it gets the court of finals or semi-final you will all have our politicians standing up and they'll be putting England jerseys on and pretending to be really interesting. Now some of them are interested in football a lot of them aren't but even the ones that aren't will suddenly be wanting to be seen and jump on this England bandwagon of success. But the minute footballers voice themselves and come out and talk about social issues. Take Marcus Rashford for example, take the captains during Covid. All of a sudden it's like well hang on a minute you get a bit above your station here. So football is allowed to...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1133,2022-11-20 08:37:20
18520," Take Marcus Rashford, for example, take the captains during Covid. All of a sudden it's like, well, hang on a minute, you get a bit above your station here. So football is allowed to speak when it suits the politicians, I always feel. It's always been a little bit of a kind of pet hate of mine. Of course, the people they answer to are their fans as well. So yes, the politicians make the statements and get the airtime in response. But I suppose it's just also... It's been striking how some of the female players have spoken out. Female football players about it. I was looking at the comments from England's Lotta Wubbin-Moyer who said she's not going to watch it. Beth Mead, of course, hugely successful striker. She's done so well in the game. She's just winning all these accolades. She's scathe herself. She said it's just so disappointing. But it's quite a big thing to say you're not going to watch it when you play football for a living. Yeah, I mean, people make their own decisions on what they have to do. I just wanted to think they're being bolder because they're not involved. Of course, yeah, of course. I mean, it's very easy to say these things if you're not going to play in the world. You're not going to play in it. It's a different thing. Do you think footballers get scared about speaking out? I get nervous. I think some will, some won't. Some are brave, some are standard. I've been really proud of footballers over the last few years. I think they've really come out on social issues. I've mentioned Rashford before. The captain's joined the thing. We've seen people like Rahim Sterling speak out brilliantly on races and things like that. So I've been really proud of the fact. And a lot of them do and a lot of them will. Well, there's less comfortable. And for me, it's purely personal issue. I don't... If somebody wants to take a stand in a certain way, that's fine. And if somebody just wants to concentrate on their game and they're probably possibly their only opportunity to play in a World Cup, and they just want to get on with a football side of it and not let these things creep in, that's fine, too. You've talked a bit about, because just to say, very clearly, home sexuality is illegal in Qatar. There are also other issues that are very different culturally for the fans, perhaps we'll come on to see. But you've also talked about, it would be a moment, not to put pressure, but it would be a bit of a moment if a footballer came out as gay. Well, you know, I did say that, but I didn't say a footballer should. No, no, no, no. The context is important. So I was saying it would be a big, you know, kind of middle finger to perhaps that thing. It won't happen, I wouldn't put pressure on any player ever to do that anyway. But of course it's an issue, the human right side of things, it has to be. Qatar World Cup Ambassador has just called homosexuality damage in the mind, which is an insight into the view, the reason for the view. And if you were gay as a fat, would you go to this tournament? It's a great question, I don't know because it's a hypothetical question. You would have to give it a lot of thought, I think. You know, I saw one of their main representatives, I think it was Al Tarni, speaking in an interview saying that, you know, people, gay people will be welcome if the question was asked, what about the walk down the street holding hands? He said that will be absolutely fine. But let's see. But there's a risk. But I understand why people, if the LGBTQ, etc, would have reservations and thoughts and concerns. Absolutely. Whether I, you could say whether I would go if I were gay, I honestly don't know. I don't know. I mean, you are going to work to... I'm going to work, yeah. How are you feeling about that with this? I'm fine, but I don't have the slightest problem about going to work. I'm not going there to support the World Cup being in Qatar. I'm going there to report. Yeah, to come. For me, that's my job as a kind of sports broadcaster journalist. Yeah. As, you know, journalists will be sent to the war with Russia and Ukraine, but it doesn't mean they support what's going on. No, no, no, I didn't mean that. But I've meant more like if there was any nervousness, you know, just things like Qatar as UK ambassador's warned against public displays of affection. I'm not saying, are we doing any affection with you? I'm just saying a fine thing. I'm just saying a fine thing. Half any single man I understand. But also, for the fans, I wonder if you've got a nervousness about that, not just on the human rights side, but the zero tolerance for drinking in public and being drunk. I know. Well, I always have concerns about English fans travelling abroad, but I'm not saying that I'm not saying that I'm drunk. I'm not saying that I'm drunk.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1134,2022-11-20 08:41:58
18521," I'm in right side but there's zero tolerance for drinking in public and being drunk. I know. Well, I always have concerns about English fans travelling abroad because I'm afraid of small percentage of them do go there looking for trouble or looking to just get drunk, looking for a fight. And that's been part of something that has been detestable around the English world for years and they ruin it for everyone else. That will happen to them in Qatar, I don't know if they go along that thing. I think we've all got... Well, all football fans obviously in their ranks have the drinking side of things. Yeah, of course. Well, it's the nervousness around the whole thing as well. I'm sure, I mean, I think we'll all be thinking ourselves out. Do we get a drink at some point? There might be that as well. Many footballers, as you've become pundits and bastards, journalists, commentators, there has also been criticism of, for instance, David Beckett becoming a paid ambassador to Qatar ahead of the World Cup. He's got to promote tourism and culture and Qatar has become a face of it. What do you make of that sort of decision? Well, that's, again, it's a personal decision. I'm not going to sit here and be judgmental. Would I do it? No. Eric Kansenai, obviously, played with him, has spoken out and urged him to think differently. Yeah. And I understand why he's done that. And as I said, would I have done it? No. He's decided to go down that route. I would say about David. He's never really voiced his concerns about where the World Cup is, about... So, you know, it's not something he's ever got involved with. It's so can you coups him, but he's not hypocritical. If I'd have done it, I'd have... I was very, very anti-the bid when it was first revealed in 2010. I was in the room. I couldn't believe it. It seemed to me that it must have been corrupt because they were talking about staging a summer World Cup in Qatar where temperatures are in the 40s. Sometimes even approaching 50 degrees centigrade. It seemed unfathomable. So, it did... Then, obviously, laterally, it was moved to winter. And I was very vocal against it. So, if I was going to do something like that, I'd feel hypocritical. I don't think you could accuse Beckham of that. You might accuse him of doing something that... You might feel he's fundamentally a wrong thing to do. And a lot of people will think that. Are you disappointed by him doing that, though? Because he's a role model. For a lot of people? He is a role model. As I said, I wouldn't do it. I think also people think, why does he need 10 million quid? Does he really need to do that? That's the other question. I mean, I don't... I've no idea how much he's getting paid, but I suspect he... I suspect he would survive without it. Big, expensive cities have a lot going for them. But if you live in one, you've probably noticed that these big, expensive cities keep getting more... Well, expensive. You could always move away. You might have just started working remotely, so there's really nothing keeping you there. But then again, moving is a hassle. Well, what if someone paid you 10 grand to do it? What if they threw in free office space, a bicycle, or a gym membership? Programs and cities and states around the US are doing exactly that, and they're getting a lot of interest. We've had over 50,000 applications. About 90,000 applications. We've had over 1800 applicants from all over North America. So are these nascent programs actually beneficial to their communities and the workers joining them? Or are they little more than flashy advertising campaigns from places looking for an injection of fresh talent? You've gotta explain this one to me. What does it mean when the White House says we're watching markets carefully? I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the blue bird. I've seen the blue bird. What does it mean? It means they have a blue bird.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1135,2022-11-20 08:46:57

18523," I mean, my day, you will still get the odd drunk, the odd sexist, the odd homophobic person, like a cross-section of working class society, and the odd person that will commit a crime. So, but it's not right. You know, it's very occasional limited. I'm not trying to defend the actions of the... I could hear that. I could hear that. I'm trying to get context and perspective of the overall picture of footballers. I suppose though, the other thing that's undeniable is we still don't have an openly gay male footballer in the Premier League. What could change or how could that change, do you think, to make that a space where it feels comfortable? I don't know. I mean, it's... Again, it's... I mean, it is distressing. And we've seen it starting to see it in other sports, aren't we? But, you know, Tom Daly we've seen, and... Well, and the women's game as well. And I just would love it if we had an environment where they just felt... It seems absurd that anyone should... Because also, it's a must for the society...to say who you are. But it's just... The society thing as well. I mean, I kind of... Probably naively said something in an interview recently. We got picked up by quite a few... Like, smart gay people, which I've kind of learnt from. I was saying, I honestly think that if a footballer came out, it would be hugely positive, and others as follow. And they... And they, you know, I was kind of told, you know, don't... Just... You've no idea how difficult this situation is. So... I mean, it is delicate. And it's true. It's kind of baffling, because it's obvious there must be... Lots of Premier League footballers and footballers around the country that... That are gay and having to live... Not their true... And not be their true selves. And I think that's really sad. Did you, like, looking back on your career, do you think you played alongside men who weren't their true selves in that way? Oh, I think so. I think so. I'm pretty sure. I don't know for a fact, but... I think so. And if you have young footballers who come to you, say that I have... I've had a couple. Both anonymous, actually. One was... One was very close to coming out. We were... He was actually the secret gay footballer. And he was... I was talking to my direct message quite a lot. And I was going to be doing the interview one... But then he got cold feet at the last second, and I said, by totally respect that, I totally understand. And then I was reached out through my agency, another anonymous football that was thinking about it. So, I don't know who they are, but they're out there. Of course, they're out there. And I can't understand how incredibly difficult it must be for... Do you think it's the fans, mainly? I don't know. It's probably everything. You know, they're kind of coming out. Who knows that mate not told their family? They might be scared about that. They might be scared about telling their teammates in the dressing room. I don't... It must be quite incredibly difficult, tough. On your coming out with your political views, a different type of coming out, and saying more what you think about things, it actually did take you a long time, didn't it? It took social media. I mean, I've always had to... No, no. I was like, I had nowhere to share them. And I think, you know, when you speak out like that, there are people who don't like the reactions and have ended up then self-sensory. Do you ever have that fear that anxiety after you've sent a post? I have a policy with... I've got three rules in Twitter. One is not to eat when I'm... I had a few drinks, which I stick to. The other is not to tweet if I'm angry, but I don't really get angry. So, you know, when I'm too frustrated. And my other one is that whenever I do any kind of tweet, I'll read it back. And then if I have 1% doubt, I won't send it. It's gone. Although that one, occasionally, when I think of something, that I think, actually, that's quite funny. I'll take a chance. But generally, they're my three rules. Would you pay for your authenticated... I wouldn't have paid 44 billion for Twitter. Well, slightly separate deals. Would you pay? Well, I never asked for it in the first place. No, no, but the whole idea of how they're going to change a model, pay... I don't know.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1137,2022-11-20 08:54:50
18524," 4 billion for Twitter. Well, it's like separate deals. Well, I never asked for it in the first place. No, but the whole idea of how they're going to change a model pay and have... I don't know yet. I'm going to weigh it out. I'm not going to make any rash decision now and say, I mean, you know, this is not... But the truth is, actually, most... I mean, a lot of people are on Twitter to follow people that they find interesting, whether they boot... Mostly blue ticked people, whether they're like a politician or actor or a sports person or a musician, or real comedians, and you follow them. And they're the blue tick ones. So, actually, I think it's the blue tick people that entice more people onto the platform. So Elon Musk, I think, should be paying us $8 a month, everyone on there, rather than the other way around. Well, you can tweet him direct, because he replies, it seems, to absolutely anyone. Does he? Oh, right. Especially if you've got a blue tick. I'd agree with me that. I'd argue to tweet it. You mentioned, of course, the reaction to footballers, former footballers, out yourself, from politicians at times. And you brought up the pandemic as well. And here in the UK, the former health secretary, Matt Hancock, when asked about football as wages during the lockdown, during the pandemic, said, quote, everybody needs to play that part in this national effort. And that means, primarily, footballers too. He talks about taking pay cuts. You remember, all of this. He's now in Australia taking part in a reality TV show, called I'm a celebrity, get me asked for, been suspended as a conservative MP. Do you think he's playing his part as an MP? I think he should have stuck to telling footballers to stick to football. Yes. I mean, I did do what he wants, but he's still an acting politician, so it seems a bit strange to me to disappear into the jungle. But I think maybe... Did you see that thing when I'm really soon back with Welcome and he shook everyone's hand and he kind of ignored Hancock in the middle? Yes. And maybe that made him go... That was it. That was it. I'm kind of bloody jungle. It might also be the 400 grand that he's been doing. That might be one of the 400 pounds reasons for him going. I don't know if that's... I don't know if he's getting that. But they do pay well apparently. Apparently so. But I suppose it was what you were talking about earlier about, who stays in which lane and who polices who... Well, of course. And with politicians, I always find it... It depends. They'll do it when it suits them. Yes, well... And then, of course, there are those who feel, you know, very passionately that our politicians shouldn't be celebrities and shouldn't be reaching for that, because they're public servants. And then there's very serious points about them going in a space when those who were bereaved during the pandemic and feel... Indeed. I can understand people's reservations about it. It's almost a kind of bit of comedy in a way, isn't it? But there are obviously more serious issues that he was... You know, he was a large part of the early days with... There's so many deaths in COVID and some... You know, they... Some would throw the blame at the government in terms of the lack of protection, certainly in care homes and things like that. So I... I don't know. Oh, no. I might... I don't know whether I'll even watch it. So you're not tempted to do any of those particular shows? You're... God, Lord, no. If you ever see me in one of those, you'll know things have gone on. We know it's really bad. That's your equivalent of taking some of these other deals perhaps. I think so, I don't know. I'd be my worst nightmare. Thank you. Thank you so much for talking to me. And thank you so much for being with us. Until we meet again, take care and goodbye. MUSIC However you get your news... This is the work day break with Link. That's Blueburg, really. Welcome to Dead Wreck Australia. Please come onto the close. Welcome to Blueburg, crypto. On TV, radio and the web. This is Blueburg. I'm going to name a couple of your babies. I don't know if I'm asking you to choose amongst your children, but you know, some of the most recognizable buildings by, of course, the Millennium Bridge, London City Hall, the Reichstag, and the Great Court British Museum. What was your favorite project to do? The Reichstag does stand out because, first of all, it's an energy manifesto. So it transforms something that was dependent on fossil fuels. It uses all the technology.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1138,2022-11-20 08:59:05
18525," the manifesto. So it transformed something that was dependent on fossil fuels, it uses all the technology to produce something which is essentially carbon neutral and there's a public building, that's a statement. It's a symbol of a city, it's a symbol of a nation, it incorporates works of art, it's recycling and existing building which as I mentioned earlier is the ultimate in sustainability if you can, if you can give a new life to a building. It also creates public space at the roof level, it's the most visited parliament in the well so it puts the public above the politicians who are answerable to them and that of course was made possible by the politicians so it's a demonstration of democracy in action. And I think we've moved from This attitude from its indulgence a waste of time, almost an illness that needs a cure. For something as universally important to human life as sleep, mysteries surrounding its necessity and utility have only just been recently uncovered. Some of our biggest discoveries were in the 1970s or 1980s, and so it makes it a really exciting field because it seems as though we're uncovering new insights each and every day. Some scientists are going further to find out how sleep and what happens there can be harness to further expand our understanding. It's easy to memorize things that makes you smart if you can spit back a lot of facts, but if you want to be wise, if you really want wisdom, you got to know when and how and why to use that information. And that's what you bring to use out while you're sleeping. A week of hope about inflation and interest rates, about China's relations with the United States, about Britain getting serious about its budget, and of course former President Trump's hope that he can do it all again. This is Bloomberg Wall Street week. I'm David Weston. This week, special contributor Larry Summers on what came out of the G20 meetings in Bali. And former Fed Vice Chair Rich Clarity, on the liquidity problem in the Treasury's market, and what can be done about it. It was a week of hoping. That things just might start to move in a better direction in U.S.-China relations. After a President Biden's meeting in Bali with President Xi. I absolutely believe there's need not be a new Cold War. I do not think there's any imminent attempt on the part of China to invade Taiwan. And I made it clear that our policy in Taiwan has not changed at all. Hoping that inflation may just be easing a bit in the United States with Fed Vice Chair Leo Brainer telling Bloomberg, we might see a bit of moderation in rate hikes. I think it will probably be appropriate to move to a slower pace of increases. But I think what's really important to emphasize, we've done a lot. But we have additional work to do both on raising rates and sustaining restraint to bring inflation down. Hoping that the new British government has gotten the message as it put forth a new budget of freedom of state utility. Okay.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1139,2022-11-20 09:03:29
18526," and sustaining restraint to bring inflation down. Hoping that the new British government has gotten the message, as it put forth a new budget designed to reassure the markets. So today, we deliver a plan to tackle the cost of living crisis and rebuild our economy. Our priorities are stability, growth, and public services. And then, of course, there's that special kind of hope that former President Trump brings to everything he does, deciding that despite what happened in the midterms to his hand-picked candidates, this was the right time to announce he's running again for President. In order to make America great and glorious again, I am tonight announcing my candidacy for President of the United States. Even as prominent investor and Republican supporter Ken Griffin of Citadel couldn't find much to hope for in Mr. Trump's candidacy. He lost in 2020. We lost Georgia because of his behavior in the Senate race in 2020. That's a second loss. And then this year, the Republicans lost the Senate because the Trump-backed candidates in the Senate races were rejected by American voters. That's a three-time loser. And I'd like to think that the Republican party's ready to move on from somebody who's been for this party a three-time loser. But whatever we were all hoping for this week, we didn't really get that much out of the markets, which traded without real conviction, with the S&P 500 off just 7 tens of a percent for the week, and the Nasdaq down 1.57 percent, and the yield on the 10-year up about seven basis points ending the week at 3.82. To help us sort it all out, we welcome now a sunny, best-law CEO of Rock Creek and Bob Michael. He's Chief Investment Officer and Head of the Global Fixed Income Unit at JPMorgan Asset Management. So welcome both you. Great to have you back. I mean, I watched the eco numbers I listened to the Fed speak. I sort of felt like I was going both ways at the same time. What did you see? Well, for a bond investor, all of us who have been battered this year, this is one of the weeks that made sense to us. We had a nice tailwind coming in from the inflation data. It was great all the way through core. When you look at shelter, everything. Yes, the markets went a little crazy. They went wild, and the central bankers did what they're supposed to do. They came in one by one and reminded us, don't declare victory yet. These are only a couple prints. There are more hikes to come, but maybe there is some optimism. And the market settled down. So I look at this week, and I thought, this is the first great week in a long time. So, Sonny, is that the way you saw it as well? And there's still some more red hikes to come? How many? I think at least another three to start with. 50 basis points next time in December, followed by at least two or three 25 basis points next year. And then we'll see from there. And I think what Bob said is very true. At the same time as we were listening to at least three fed people come and speak. I wrote down, I think they all had very different coats. And you had some of that when Labour not talked. But you also had the president of St Louis fed say something slightly different as if we would continue with rate increases for a while longer than she had implied. And then of course we had Susan Collins come in today with even sort of potential 75 basis points. So we're hearing numbers that are a little bit all over the place and trying to make sense of it. So Bob, are the markets making it harder for the fed as a practical matter? They were at the start of the week. I think not so much now. I think we're all in the same spot. We've all got realistic expectations. The fed's headed to four and a half, five percent. They'll get there some time in the first quarter. We'll see where inflation is. If it's below the fed funds rate, then that gives them some scope to pause on the tightening. We can reevaluate at that point. But right now, Bon Yelts have gone up a long way in a very short period of time. It's time for a breath. Bob, is that good as to a soft landing? Unfortunately, it does not. And I think that's the one consistent message from the fed. Susan Collins aside, which is there is going to be pain for businesses and households. So you have this magnitude of...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1140,2022-11-20 09:07:40
18527," A single statement coming out of it, they did come to some agreement. In part, driven by some of the developing countries, should that be encouraging to investors, actually, that we're getting back perhaps a little toward multilateral cooperation? Much more positive news came out of the G20 than we all expected. And as you said, there was also a lot of big stress on reform of the multilateral lending, because the big news out of that meeting was that there's huge needs when it comes particularly to emerging markets, climate-related investments. And there's no way with the existing finances of the multilateral that that could be met. So that was why there was a lot of emphasis on the reform of the multilateral sector, but also getting the multilateral to work much better with the private sector to generate more resources. And you saw that very particular case of Indonesia, which was discussed a lot and written up a lot with about 20 billion going to replace coal in Indonesia with cleaner fuels. About another important development this week, sort of a rolling development is the outcomes of the midterm elections. We found out that the Democrats will hold on to the Senate. The Republicans will get a narrow majority in the House. What does that communicate if anything to investors? Is that sort of a steady as you go way because we have a split government not much is going to happen either way? So it for sure is, I will tell you, going back to the G20, we're actually hearing from clients, large institutional clients, that they're more confident about allocating to markets when the G20 countries are talking to one another again and working with one another again. So that's a huge positive. I don't remember that in gosh over a decade. When you go back to the gridlock in Washington, I hate to say it, but the markets kind of like it. It's when there are dramatic policy changes. You have to reprice everything in the markets. It becomes destabilizing. There are always going to be some winners. There are going to be some losers. This time, if we know we're going to have gridlock, we can focus on bringing inflation down and trying to avoid a recession and have a soft land. I think a lot of people in the street think that it's sort of hypocritic. Players do no harm. If you're not doing anything, you're at least not messing things up. Bob Michael of JPMorgan and I'm sorry, a bachelor's of rockery, will be staying with us as we look at what this week meant for our investment decisions. That's the next time, Wall Street Week. I'm Bloomberg.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1141,2022-11-20 09:15:55
18528," We think it will create some of the most valuable companies the market's ever seen. I think it's certainly driven companies like Cisco, given them the life that they've had. It's obviously also spectacularly volatile, but the market has pulled back in this sector since it came public since it began in 1995. It's pulled back 30 to 50 percent at least seven or eight times. That was Henry Blodget talking about the internet and tech on Wall Street way back in June of 2000. When the number one movie in the country was Mission Impossible 2, and the most popular song in the country was Maria Maria by Santana. It was a lot of Michael of JP Morgan and of Sonny Bachelors of Rod Creek are still with us. So, Sonny certainly Mr. Blodget was right that we gave us some awfully big and successful companies. No question about it. Some people thought that would happen as well in the crypto space. This week we're not quite as sure after FTX. What do we make of that? Does that have broader significance in the markets or is it just a one off? Hopefully it is more limited. I think there's no question that without regulation and we've all been talking about having this sector regulated. Help the market itself, but also the investors going in having this particular come you know FTX, which is an exchange core crypto. Be based in the Bahamas with not just no regulation, but also with a few people who had very limited experience in finance or in anything really. I run it. I think the shocking part of it David was that very very sophisticated venture firms from Sequoia and others who were invested. It was not just retail getting involved in that market. So, it was a surprise, but hopefully it will get limited. And I think it has put a lot of pressure on increasing regulation sooner here. And that will be a good thing for the market. Now let's not forget that the whole market is less than you know at 900 billion. I'm not saying that that's tiny, but it's still not significant enough to create any kind of stress in the market. Unless we're missing something that we don't know at this point. I think what's important David, when you watch that clip and that was the absolute peak in in the dot com bubble. Yes, there was a massive shake out. There was a massive consolidation, but I would argue the internet and tech evolved far beyond. Would any of us ever thought it would be in 2000? I wonder if we're going through the same thing with crypto and NFTs that it got a great start. There is going to be a shake out of Sonya's right. There's probably going to be a lot of regulation. But when I talk to the young people on our desk and our platform, there's still a big believer. And if the millennials are a believer 22 years from now, they're going to be looking at disc clip. And I hope we got it right. That's fascinating. There is no question as a generational issue here. Let's come back to the current generation and people who's old as I am. I'm older than you are, but it's all I'm. What about bonds right now? Do you invest in bonds? For the first time in a decade, absolutely. And I will tell you that we're seeing interest from everywhere now. Every wealth management platform in JP Morgan, every institutional client, they're coming to us, they're putting money in bonds, they're looking to commit more, and they haven't done so for years. If I look at where we got to at the start of the year, a general bond fund, the Bloomberg Ag yielded 1.7%. Now we're up at 4.7%. We have 3% higher yields, and that's going to track investment. And as I said, I think the Fed is close to the end. I don't know if they get to 5%. We're kind of in the 4.5, 4.3%, 4.4%. That's going to bring a lot of stability to the market at these levels. Bonds are back. So I'm saying you manage a fair amount of money. What about for you, are bonds attractive at this point? Are you just equities? I think as said, what is very interesting right now is even in any foundation or endowment or the assets that we manage, you're finding exactly the same phenomenon where people had moved away from bonds and cash, and we're all equities and private investments moving back into holding bonds.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1142,2022-11-20 09:19:45
18529," and private investments moving back into holding bonds. And as we've sort of reaching that 4-5 percent that Bob talked about, much more interest in bonds in a more balanced kind of portfolio. And of course, people are looking at cash with 4 percent at the Treasury bills at the level that is much higher than cash was earned in a very long time. But I think the bigger thing that is happening in the portfolio is we're looking at is obviously a lot of investors, institutional investors have been also investing in venture, private equity, real estate, in private form. And I think that is going to some sort of transformation too. Well, let's take a segue if we could from that sort of investment into COP27. As we're speaking right now, it's still going to end on Saturday. Right now, of Sony, you know far better than I do. It looks like it's going to be difficult for them to get to the objectives that they had. You're absolutely right. So far, as we know tonight, the latest news was not too positive. Not things could change tomorrow morning. But they didn't really have anything major to announce. Again, as you remember in COP26, they had the G-Fans, which was a large number of large asset managers, signing up to make pretty significant shifts in their carbon print. But most recently, they started walking back from that or not wanting to sign quite on what they had agreed to in COP26. So I think it's very, very important, as we're having these meetings, maybe they shouldn't be every year. Maybe they should be every other year or less often, but show some sort of progress. And the most important part of the discussion this time, David, has been a fact that developing countries again have felt that they are in some cases suffering, because if they're an island economy, they're going underwater, if they are affected by droughts and by floods. A lot of it might be caused by those who did use a lot of carbon over the last 10, 20 years. And they're asking if they could get help. And that help is really not coming. And I think that is the really major summary of COP27, which is that the expectations of investments into climate are probably less than what we expected going into the COP. Well, and just picking up on that on the investments in it, Bob, I want to come back to you, because I want to think at least I'm taking away from COP27. You can certainly hear, listen to John Kerry, the president's special envoy on this subject. We're not going to get to it from public money alone. It's going to take a fair amount of private investment. As a bond person, are there bonds that are green bonds or in the climate that make sense as a business matter? There are. I think for sure, if you're going to finance something, which is what bond investors do, you want something that has something of a green agenda to it. And we're hearing that from our clients. There's more and more money coming into the space. I think Afsania help is on the way for the island economies. The large-scale investors want to commit capital to this space. Well, the inflation reduction act, as it's called, a lot of people object to that title, put a lot of money into the game here on that private side of Sunday. Is it making a difference in the projects they're getting financed? No question. I think the R.A. is a very powerful act, and it's the largest amount of money going in. And I think that will really help us in the U.S. to invest a lot more in climate-related food and ag in battery storage, in residential and in community-related solar and wind. So that will be a major, major push. And we're seeing, as Bob mentioned, a lot of movement. I agree with him. I think it's just that in COP, where you expected public money to go in, there was a sort of disappointment with that. But the private sector is doing a lot. The young generation is doing a lot. We just need the public sector to jump in when it comes to it outside of the IRA, of course. Bob, last word, are you seeing a difference in your part of the business in the government tax policy when it comes to green bonds? We are. Yeah, absolutely. It's making a real difference, you see it? It is from our perspective. So yeah, everything we see that, and we didn't touch on the regulation, there's going to...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1143,2022-11-20 09:24:15
18530," It is from our perspective. So yeah, everything we see that, and we didn't touch on the regulation, there's going to be more regulation poking through what qualifies as a green bond or not, and also to prevent any greenwashing, either in specific bonds or in bond funds. So watch this space. Yeah, okay. We're particularly with the new Congress coming in. Thank you so much. Really great to have both of you with us. We're going to take a look at next week on Wall Street all around the world. It's here on Bloomberg. We're going to take a look at the new Congress.

I'm going to look at what's up next week on global Wall Street starting with Annabelle droolers in Hong Kong. Well thanks David. This week in Asia we're going to be taking a close look at two big elections. Now in Malaysia voting took place this Saturday just over a month after parliament was dissolved for a snap poll. And then meanwhile Taiwan that holds midterms is coming weekend. So that's going to be a pulse check on the popularity of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party. Of course we see geopolitical tensions continue to rise in the region. Eco wise the highlight is on central bank meetings in Korea and New Zealand. And we're going to be live from Seoul for the B.O.K. with expectations there for a half point hike. Plus the RVNZ predicted to deliver its six straight 50 basis point move. The 2022 World Cup kicks off on Sunday in Qatar. The tournament is being held in the winter for the first time due to the blistering summer temperatures in the region. Thursday sees rate decision by Sweden's Riksbank. Economist forecast a 75 basis point hike. But surging food prices could tip the bank to raise by even more. We'll also on the same day get an account of the ECB's most recent policy meeting. And last certainly not least you energy ministers will be meeting to discuss policy outlook as Europe heads into the winter. A holiday shortened week for the observance of Thanksgiving Day. The main focal point for the week. The local center around the release of the FOMC minutes from that November meeting. A meeting that saw the Fed raise interest rates by 75 basis points for fourth straight time. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said then that U.S. interest rates would go higher than earlier projected but several Fed members since have indicated that they may be ready to downshift. A handful of earnings next week to watch including Zoom video, deer and a log devices best by and Nordstrom keep an eye on those last two for read.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1144,2022-11-20 09:28:39

Keep an eye on those last two for a read on the strength of the consumer as the traditional kickoff to the holiday shopping season in the US begins on Friday. The main theme to watch there will be the flight to discounted items by cash trap consumers that seem willing to spend, but maybe not have the same capacity as they did a year ago. David. Thanks to Annabelle Duller's Danny Berger and Romaine Bostic. Coming up, we saw it happen in the guilt market. Could a crisis come to the markets for US treasuries? And would it come from a lack of liquidity? We're going to ask former vice chair of the Fed, Richard Clareta of Fimco. That's next on Wall Street Week on Bloomberg. Thank you. Hirogyne has a very special place in the universe. It's the first element on the periodic table. It is the most abandoned element in the universe. And when clean energy advocates think about what can we find, which would be as easy to use as fossil fuels, they think about hydrogen. The fuel that will, when burn, only produce water. We like to imagine that if we just built enough of these and these, we could ditch fossil fuels and save the planet. Unfortunately, it's not that simple. There are some things where you just need a good old-fashioned combustible fuel. Now startups around the world are betting that hydrogen can become the fuel of the 21st century. This is Wall Street Week. I'm David Weston. We spent a good deal of this week trying to figure out where the Fed is heading on rate increases. And part of what we were watching was the Fed's vice chair, Leo Brandard, who gave us at least some hope that we might be getting closer to slowing down. I think it will probably be appropriate soon to move to a slower pace of increases. But I think what's really important to emphasize, we've done a lot, but we have additional work to do, both on raising rates and sustaining restraint to bring inflation down. We welcome now, Ms. Brandard's predecessor as vice chair, Richard Clarita, now global economic advisor to PIMCO. So Richard, thank you so much for being back with us. Good to have you back with us. So do you agree with your successor there? Do you think we're at least approaching a point where we might slow down the pace of increases?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1145,2022-11-20 09:32:48
18532," So Richard, thank you so much for being back with us. Good to have you back with us. So do you agree with your successor there? Do you think we're at least approaching a point where we might slow down the pace of increases? David, I do. You know, the Fed has done a lot this year. In fact, it'll be the fastest pace of rate heights since the early 1980s. I do anticipate that at the December meeting, they'll slow the pace from 75 to 50 basis points. And I think as we move into 2023, I think they think and I agree that they're close at least to a pause, probably in the first half of next year. They said in the November statement, they've done a lot and they want to see how the rate heights are impacting the economy. So Richard, you have the advantage of having been in the room and having been in the room relatively recently. Give us a sense of what they're looking at their dashboard because I'm going to say the economic numbers sometimes point in different directions. On the one hand, we do have some indications like the CPI numbers that may be slowing down a little bit the inflation. On the other hand, the overall inflation is still pretty high. It is. And you know, the challenge that Fed faces and other central banks in the world is that the economy is running hot and in particular, wages in the economy are growing much faster than consistent with the 2% longer run goal. And so I think that the Fed will be looking at the labor market data. It'll also be looking at inflation expectations. We have downshifted demand growth. There's an imbalance between demand and supply. And this year, demand growth has already downshifted. So that's an important thing to note. We're certainly along the way to where we need to be. But the Fed has more to do and we need to get inflation back down towards the 2% objective. So everyone seems to agree there's more for the Fed to be done. We just heard Leo Brenner say exactly that. And the question is how much more? And part of the question is, what's the terminal rate? I mean, how far up do we go? We had some somewhat conflicting indications this week, actually. And the banks basically project these things are coming up with very different sorts of answers. What determines that terminal rate? And let me ask you, perhaps more pointedly, some people think the Fed was a little slow getting off the market and getting going. Does the slowness of getting started mean the terminal rate? We'll have to be higher necessarily. David, I don't think so. I think what launching the rate heights in March did mean, and I think Chair Powell recognized this pretty early on, was that it made sense to get to the destination pretty quickly. And that's why we've had the four successive 75 basis point hikes. My sense right now is the committee believes. And I share the view that my baseline view is I want to get the funds rate around 5%. If the inflation data comes in on the soft side, maybe four and three quarters. If it comes in on the hot side, maybe five and a quarter. Or perhaps as President Ballard indicated, maybe north of that. But I think around 5% in the spring will be at a level where they've done a lot. They realize that inflation responds to policy with a lag. And I think that that'll be a good place to take stock. So I think that I wouldn't call that necessarily the terminal rate. I hope it is. If the inflation data doesn't improve, then they may have to do more. But I think they will pause at around 5%. So Richard, I think you just put the figure on the thing that at least perplexes me, which is it two-place function. I mean, you've got what the rates are. You also have what inflation is. And how restrictive that is, depends on how far and how fast inflation comes down. So going into the spring, if you're at 5%, how far down do you need to get inflation before you say, OK, that's restrictive enough? It's an excellent point because typically monetary policy does operate with a lag. So the Fed wants to look ahead. And indeed, for example, Governor Waller and others have made reference to comparing the policy rate to where professional forecasters think inflation will be towards the end of the year. And I appreciate that point. My own research actually indicates that's a simple thing to do. I think the challenge they face, David, is that quite frankly, the Fed's record at forecasting inflation has not been very good, including what I was there last year. And so I think it's going to be a balance between adjusting policy according to both the forecasters and the incoming data. Richard is not just the rates that are going on. We also have so-called quantitative tightening as you try to run down the balance sheet which had gone so far up. Give us your sense of what that is doing right now out of financial conditions in the United States.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1146,2022-11-20 09:37:18
18533," We also have so-called quantitative tightening as you try to run down the balance sheet which had gone so far up. Give us your sense of what that is doing right now to financial conditions in the United States. Well, David, it is tightening conditions. Again, quantitative tightening is reversing quantitative easing. So the Fed's balance sheet is shrinking. Now, it's been very well telegraphed and so markets certainly understand the pace and the modalities of tightening. But it is serving to tighten financial conditions and that's consistent with what the Fed wants to do in terms of raising rates. So, Richard, that takes us to a subject that I know you've heard a lot about. We read about all the time which is perhaps a problem with liquidity in the treasury market. There's more volatility in the treasury market, as I understand it, but that's inherent in raising rates. The question is, is there additional volatility because there's not as much liquidity? We hear at least anecdotally that some people are having difficulty buying and selling large lots of treasuries. Yeah. Well, it's true. I went back and looked. I had the privilege of 20 years ago of serving as assistant treasury secretary in 01 or 02. And in those years, debt outstanding was about $3 trillion, about 30% of GDP. This year, it's $23 trillion or 100% of GDP. So, quite simply, the amount of debt outstanding and the amount of treasury issuance is vastly larger than it was 10 or 15 years ago. And the plumbing of the intermediation system for treasury says not really expanded, can commonly with that. And so, as a result, there is evidence on occasion of ill liquidity in the market, certainly in extreme cases, as we observed in March of 2020 or September of 2019. It becomes even more evident. And so, I think policymakers at the Fed and the treasury and other agencies are looking at ways in which treasury market functioning can be improved. And I think it's certainly something that should be studied and improved. And what are possible options if they do conclude there's an issue there? One of my suppose would be reversing and going back to quantitative easing. That's one way to do it. Another might be actually to ameliorating at least some of the restrictions in regulation and repost after the 2008 Great Financial Crisis, which really is an interest to took a lot of the big banks, and limited their participation in the market. Well, it's right. And so, I think that one of the things, David, that we did in the spring of 2020, is that we did relax, something called the Supplementary Leverage Ratio, in the sense that we would not count bank reserves or the banks. Or treasury holdings against that leverage ratio. The idea is we wanted to encourage banks to lend in the pandemic shutdown. And the Fed indicated when it left those exemptions, laps, that it would begin, it would review whether or not it made sense to include treasuries and reserves in that leverage calculation. I'm sure that analysis is ongoing, but I think that's certainly something worth serious study. What is the rationale, actually, for the SLR? I don't not sure I understand it, because I would think the treasuries are as close to risk-free as possible. You know, the history of this is before the GFC, David, we had risk-based standards for banks, and so treasuries are not risky, other bonds are more risky. There was a sense broadly in the global community, not just in the U.S., but through the Basel process in Europe and Asia, central bank and policy makers agreed that it made sense to have a Supplementary Leverage Ratio that typically would not be binding most of the time, but it could prevent, if you will, financial institutions from gaming, an entirely risk-based system. However, you know, we discovered in March of 2020 the banks were in great shape, the banks were part of the solution, not part of the problem, and there can be perverse consequences of having a Supplementary Leverage Ratio, especially when central banks are doing large amounts of key lead, because the creating reserves, which the system has to absorb. So I think it's certainly something that could address, and I think it could make a lot of sense. Well, thank you so much for being on Wall Street Week. I hope you'll come back often, it's really good to have you, which would clear it up, of PIMCO. Coming up, we're going to wrap up the week with our Special Presumption of Larry Summers of Harvard.

So what about the other 71%? Building across America burned fossil fuels to operate. What we want to do is make that all electric. Instead of burning oil and gas to give us the energy and electricity we need, we want to do 100% clean energy, all electric. We want to turn buildings into Tesla's. Just like a Tesla or an electric vehicle is all electric with no fossil fuels. We want to do that with our buildings. If we can do it in one building, we can do it in all buildings.

This is Wall Street Week, I'm David Weston. Welcome back now, our special contributor Larry Summers of a Harvard to wrap up the week for us. Larry, thank you so much for being back with us. A lot of us spent a lot of the week actually trying to figure out where the Fed is headed, particularly where the terminal rate is. And we got conflicting, I think at least, somewhat conflicting answers out of the Fed, including with Mr. Bullard, the Fed president, saying, well, five, five and a quarter and then put up a chart using the Taylor rule that suggested seven. Where are we? Look, no one knows. I think it's a mistake to be slavish about Taylor rules. The market thinks the number is going to be about five. I look at things and my sense is there's more room for that to be too low than there is for that to be too high. But it's pretty clear that we've had the big moves on this cycle. And now we're going to be finishing that process off. My view is that there's more risk from stopping prematurely and not really curing inflation and setting the stage up for a re-acceleration of inflation after it comes down. I see that as a bigger risk than going too far because going too far would mean bringing inflation down below 2%. And that still seems to me like an awfully remote risk starting from where we are. But I think that the Fed has this in the right place when it says that they're going to move up somewhat more and they're going to take stock of the situation and see what the inflation data is saying and seeing what the inflation forecasts are saying when we get to the spring of next fall, winter rather spring of next year. I have to say that if they hadn't made as many mistakes as they did of excessive optimism about inflation, they'd probably have a little more room than 2.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1148,2022-11-20 09:45:53
18535," you you you you you you I'm the mysterious wrushter decline in condemning Russia. So I think we've got a lot of work to do, and we in the United States tend to be a bit over optimistic about the extent to which all others see us in the benign way that we see ourselves. It's such an important point, and it takes me back at least to China, because it seems to me that sometimes we've been overly optimistic, I mean, for example, going back at the time, we admitted into the WTO, we thought China was going to become more like us, and then we go over the other extreme of being, perhaps overly pessimistic about China. I guess my question for you is former treasury sector among other things. How do we play both sides of that? We don't know how it will end up. How do we keep open the realistic possibility we can really work closely with China, but also protect ourselves against the possibility of confrontation? We in the United States probably need to be careful about our evangelizing influence. I don't think it's really for us to tell China how they should organize their entire society. I think it's for us to stand up for some of our fundamental interests in security, in fair economic competition, but to leave it at that point, I think we're going to need to be very careful with respect to our diplomacy on the issue of Taiwan. I think we need to be very careful about giving China the sense.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1149,2022-11-20 09:49:53
18536," to our diplomacy on the issue of Taiwan. I think we need to be very careful about giving China the sense that we are trying to change the traditional one-China policy, because I think that could risk disastrous conflict. So I think the operative words for us need to be respect for them, respect for positions and the fundamental interests that they have, and at the same time, absolute insistence on our own. And I would say one other thing, David, I think ultimately we will prevail in this broad contest with China. But I think if and when we prevail, it is going to be more than anything else on the strength of our example. And that's why domestic renewal at home, whether the issue is scientific innovation or infrastructure, whether the issue is doing something about opiate deaths or whether the issue is strengthening our education system, whether the issue is building on the greatness of our universities or the greatness of our national parks. And ultimately, it's going to be our ability to remain the country that's the envy of the world, the country to which people want to come that is going to determine our success. And if we change our focus from building ourselves up to tearing China down, I think we will be making a very risky and very unfortunate choice. Larry, I want to make a very large turn here. I've had the benefit of talking to you about the masters, about basketball, I want to talk to about Taylor Swift. She's a rather popular pop music star and ticket master because we now know the Department of Justice is investigating possible antitrust problems there because of ticket master, which does after all have like a 70% market share that's been under investigation for some time. I don't know if you know much about Tyler Swift, although I am concerned about you getting tickets, which apparently seems to be difficult. But more broadly, what is it say perhaps about some of the problems with over concentration in the economy? You know, I want to say two things about that, David. The first is that if the government made a website that functioned as badly as ticket masters has here, everybody would be laughing and scorning the government. And so the next time the private sector says that, you know, the public sector can't do anything right. This was a private sector building a website, sort of like that to build a website for Obamacare, sort of like they have to build websites at the IRS, or like they have to build a build websites for student loan debt relief. And the private sector utterly failed. And that's something that we just have to remember the next time somebody wants to say everything about government is hopeless. Yeah, we are. We are a kind of trust. Yeah, Larry, we're going to have to leave it there. I'm so sorry. We're a humble. We have much to be humble about. Larry, thank you so very much. It's Larry. Some of us are a very special contributor here on Wall Street Week. Coming up, a lot of people get hurt when there's a collapse like that of FTX, but who stands to benefit?

18537, I think that it's hard to put your head around any narrative. Let's just be honest. We've had sort of a shift in are we in some sort of circulation fears moment people were talking about that all day yesterday. Can it sustain its normal at a time when everybody else is facing a very different way. Finally one more thought if Tom Brady's for it it's got to be good right. I'm getting into crypto with FTX you're in. Despite that endorsement from the greatest quarterback of all time the collapse of Sam Bankman freeds FTX has brought heartbreak to a lot of people wiping out in one fell swoop what was estimated to be a 32 billion dollar empire leaving what its lawyers now say could be as many as a million creditors holding the bank and by the way triggering a class action lawsuit against Tom Brady and others paid to tout FTX to the world. The ripple effects of the collapse of FTX and the rest of Sam Bankman freeds empire now beginning here as we wait for bankruptcy proceedings all of which has shaken the confidence of many investors that's according to Citadel's can Griffin FTX is is one of these absolute travesties in the history of financial markets people are going to lose billions of dollars and that undermines trust in all financial markets. But as bad as the FTX collapse may be it's only the latest in a series of major meltdowns we've seen in recent years just think back to 2001 when that mythical energy giant Enron hit the skids its former CEO Jeff skilling reflected back on the loss in his later testimony before Congress. I am devastated by an apologetic about what Enron has come to represent. No words can make things right too many people have been hurt too much. Or World Com the telecommunications phenom of the late 90s that followed Enron into bankruptcy in 2002 wiping out a market cap of 186 billion dollars and sending its former CEO Bernie Ebers to prison despite his trying to seek protection behind the fifth amendment. I've been instructed by my counsel not to testify based on my fifth amendment constitutional rights. Or that emblem of the first internet bubble pets dot com with that cute sock puppet mascot which was an instant market hit when it went public and just as quickly went flop. All of these notorious failures shared a bold vision a confident leader and a belief that they'd come up with a better maus trap just like Mr. Bankman freed and if FTX follows the pattern it will share one other thing with colossal failures through the years a lot of lawyers making a lot of money despite all the carnage. When Enron went into bankruptcy it had assets of over 65 billion dollars in the ultimate resolutions shareholders were wiped out at a loss of 74 billion dollars but the lawyers they walked away with over one billion dollars along with the accounts. World Com was three times as big losing investors in estimated 175 billion dollars while the lawyers were making over ten million dollars a month in a proceeding to last it well over a year. Lehman was forced into bankruptcy amid one of the most turbulent periods in our economic history which culminated in a catastrophic crisis of confidence and a run on the bank. But those were all small potatoes compared with Lehman bankruptcy that wiped out between 46 billion and 63 billion dollars according to the New York Fed and netted the lawyers and other consultants a cool get this six billion dollars so we'll see.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1151,2022-11-20 09:58:44
18538," and $63 billion according to the New York Fed, and netted the lawyers and other consultants a cool, get this $6 billion. So we'll see how much the FTX creditors end up writing off, much less the token holders. As much pain as they're feeling though, you can be sure that there's one group that will come out okay.

So what's the best investment advice you've ever written? You haven't found anybody. The compound interest, the compounding of returns is an incredible miracle of business, finance, and human existence. Everything you learn is additive every day, and if you keep at it and don't quit, it's an incredible miracle. And it's not just interest. It was always said about compound interest returns, compound business returns, compound human returns. They're all very additive because you'll learn every day. And if you keep at it, it's very, very helpful. In your observation of investors, what do you think is the biggest mistake that average investors make? Selling it the wrong time.

We will never break. Build on a foundation strong enough to stay. We will never. Welcome everybody to the inaugural NIL Summit and NIL Awards. In July 2022, Atlanta hosted what might sound like a boring legal seminar. A conference on the new rules around name, image, and likeness in sports. But far from dry and academic, the first annual NIL Summit was in fact a flashy star-studded event, put on at the College Football Hall of Fame. And Mingling amid the biggest current and former names in sports and media, there was a crucial cohort. The player is poised to redefine what it means to be a modern college athlete. And the winner of male athlete of the year goes to Chase Griffin. Among those up-and-comers, UCLA's Chase Griffin. The UCLA quarterback is among the students becoming as well known for making deals as making plays. And even in that group, Chase stands out. My name is Chase Griffin. What's up everyone? It's Chase Griffin. It's your favorite quarterback, it's favorite quarterback, Chase Griffin. When you look at it as an empowerment equity opportunity, it's really been unmatched in the sports world for any point in time since Title IX. Better a scope.

18539," It's really been unmatched in the sports world for any point in time since Title IX. Better a scope. After hardly a full year of name image and likeness deals being a reality, he already has more than 20 deals with major brands, venture and charitable groups. All the while bouncing, graduating undergrad in just two years and fighting for playing time on the field. Chase Griffin out of the gun. We are joined by UCLA quarterback Chase Griffin. Just UCLA quarterback, but name image likeness superstar. Why am I in sight for this one? This kid could actually be the president of the United States someday. Chase isn't the starting quarterback for UCLA. He's not even the backup quarterback, but back on campus in LA, his nickname is President Chase. And after spending a couple days talking about his approach to business, sports and equality, it's not shocking to think he might someday hold that office. His level of focus and maturity at this stage. I only wish I had if you wanted by stocking him in green by stocking Chase Griffin. When it comes to building generational wealth, it's not about the money that you make in college. I'm very excited that I made the amount of money that I made last year. I am even 10 times more excited that I know how to make that money. Somewhere on any college campuses, mostly for the athletes who are on lighter, but still regimented schedules. The tendon classes working out, a little bit of hanging out, and then more working out on their own time. Chase is no exception. The 21-year-old is a backup, albeit an impatient one. In the Topsy-Turvy past couple of seasons dotted with families, games and COVID protocols, he's been able to start three games for the Bruins. Griffin, go to the end zone. Wide open again, touchdown UCLA. Being Arizona and narrowly losing to both Stanford and Oregon. That was inches away from Chase Griffin and UCLA being in full fledged comeback mode. For Chase, UCLA felt like destiny. He was born just a few miles away before his family moved to Texas when he was a toddler. But beyond being a sort of homecoming, the school's history of athlete activism was a massive draw. I always expected from myself to have some sort of impact, but it was beneficial for more people than I interact with on a daily basis. And choosing UCLA, a lot of that went into me seeing myself as someone who reflected the same want to make things better, that so many of the people that UCLA prides itself upon be in the home for it have done in the past. The legacies of former UCLA greats like Arthur Ash, Jackie Robinson, Karim Abdul Jabbar and Jackie Joyner Cursey have had a wide ranging impact on society well beyond the Westwood campus. Chase reveres these people, but he's perhaps most keenly aware of the activism of a more recent Bruin alum, the basketball player at Obanon. At Obanon, who was an ace-smith player of the year National Champ, UCLA Sports Legend is also a legal hero. I think NIO could be the next installment where we look back in 30, 40, 50 years and God willing if we give him the roses he deserves, we add at Obanon to that list of UCLA greats. Obanon, who played at UCLA from 91 to 95, initiated a lawsuit that's widely credited for finally opening up the possibility of college athletes being paid for use of their name image and lightness. He sued the NCAA in video game publisher EA for anti-trust violations, arguing that athletes should be entitled to financial compensation when schools used their lightness for gain. In 2014, a judge ruled in his favor.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1153,2022-11-20 10:07:32
18540," I don't think he was congratulating me. What was your call? And then on an episode of the shop, surrounded by Obanan, Dianna Tarrassi, and LeBron James, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed the first ultimately successful legislation to allow athletes to receive endorsement deals. The Fair paid a play act led other states to follow suit and ultimately led the NCAA in 2021 to relent, seemingly reluctantly. NIL payments were officially allowed as of July 1st, 2021. Today is the last day where name, image, and likeness laws will not be on the books, and kids will not be, if you will, not allowed to make money off of their name, image, and likeness. Making money from Jersey sales and endorsement deals is a way for players to share in the massively lucrative world of college athletics. This NIL thing is the wild, wild west. The NIL change felt like many things that happened very slowly and then it happened very fast. And I wonder for you, having contemplated that maybe this was coming at some point, how prepared were you, what was your mindset when the switch flipped? Right. I mean, I still think everyone's trying to get prepared for the industry. It's still sort of like a wild, wild west. I wasn't really expecting anything. I was more just thinking about honestly getting ready for that season and capitalizing on everything that was happening. When NIL hit and it turned out I had action, I was like, oh, okay, well after this degree deal, which was fantastic, I was like, okay, I see how I can be a staple in this game and I see how I can get better over time. That's why I teamed up with my friends at Shell. You keep on building clear coverage. You keep on building and you get better in the meetings. And most of all, you start seeing where your value can be best placed in these new opportunities. The headlines and storylines in the aftermath of the NIL change introduced visions of instant millionaire strolling campuses across the nation. You might think the NIL athlete of the year lives in Splendor or at least in one of those athletic halices that put most of our coach dorms to shame. Well, it's all relative to chase. All right, Jason. So here we are, World Headquarters. Yep. This is where it all happens. There's the kitchen right here. I actually really enjoy cooking. Oh, yeah. Yeah, this gas oven gets really hot really fast. I make pizzas in there. This is the best appliance since the iPhone Air Friday. You can put anything in there. I need to do these dishes right here. So no trappings of success yet. More a pretty average college dorm room. The fridge filled with leftovers, a well-used PS4. And of course, the requisite Godfather poster. It's a far cry from the lifestyle seen in some local news reports for NIL athletes during this first year. But these on Robinson made headlines with an NIL deal with Lamborghini Austin. Lamborghini's tend to make more headlines than Muhammad Ali are Bruce Lee pictures. Some athletes who are living in mansions driving Lamborghinis. As far as I know, you're doing either of those things. I see where you're living right here. It is with all to respect, not a mansion. How much of that is a conscious choice and what does it say about sort of your approach to this? Right. First of all, I look at this. It's my own room. I got everything I need. I'm cool with that. I'm cool with living below my means. I think it's important to remember that the volume of financial gain is completely overstated. That's what it y'all is following. Immediately. And someone hears about a five million or ten million dollar deal. You've got to report it. Like, oh my goodness, people are going to read this. Hey, I'd count two things. How many kids are even getting these deals? And then for the kids that do get it, how much of that is in liquor cash? How much of it is in assets? Have you paid for a two million dollar house out here in LA for a kid to stay in college? That's great. But as soon as they're graduated, they're not going to have that two million dollars. I say the same thing, you know, for the kids who are driving around in Lamborghinis and stuff like that. That's awesome. Like, that's super dope. And I know some of those kids. But, you know, someone paying for your lease is different.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1154,2022-11-20 10:11:59
18541," who are driving around in Lamborghini's and stuff like that. That's awesome. That's super dope and I know some of those kids. But someone paying for your lease is different than someone actually giving you the value of that lease every single month. You're investing in it, saving it for a long time, et cetera. I say all that just to mention that product deals and stuff like that are overhyped by the media. And they also can land kids in some trouble if they're not paying taxes on it. That's one of the distinctly unsexy and easy to overlook elements of the new rules. Even if an athlete's not getting cold hard cash from a deal, the value of any products given are subject to state and federal taxes. So suddenly, what a player sees as free gear in return for some social media posts actually equals taxable income. And that requires the same forms you'd fill out as an independent contractor getting a check. I made a fair amount in NIO deals and I invested all of it. In my opinion, NIO is great. Doing all this is great. Making money now is great. But the most valuable thing I've gotten from all of this is, in the fact, I'll always know how to make money off of myself. All told, Chase has done more than 20 deals with major brands like Degree, Shell, and Boost Mobile, along with venture-stage companies including Discord, Duffel, and Creative Juice. He's also made a point to work with charities like the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank, where he's already raised funds for almost 60,000 meals. OK, so you're moving in on me quick. Just stradzing me with your fancy hands. I'm going to deal with your night, because this is really bothering me. Ah, my night. Yeah. He's a troublemaker. Yeah. What did you get up to this weekend? You know, just robot stuff. A lot of chess. I was practicing for you. I know you're pretty good. Ooh, I don't like that. I will take this. Put it over here here. Not cool. Not cool.

18542," It was a song by Julian. I heard the opening. I just took that opening and I pitched it slow or I think I sped it. At his desk when he's not making music, another side project, he's either networking with CEOs or investors he seeks out or who seek him out or negotiating new deals. Hey Mallory. I'm doing well. I'm turning on my camera right now. You're no worries. This is an average NIL deal. A brand approaches an athlete who can help spread their message to a demographic they believe the athlete can help reach. In this case, direct TV is looking to market their NFL Sunday ticket to college students. It'd be two posts, one post late August and one post on the first week of September. And the compensation would be 1200 per post so it would be 400 total. Right. Are they video posts or are they picking captions? They can be either. It's up to you guys. That was pretty good. 400 above, but they had originally asked so that's a win. So yeah, I mean, at this point after I do a Zoom or something like that, I had to chill out and go back to land down if I was watching a movie or something or go to YouTube to start looking for more samples. It's a pretty simple interaction for Chase and for direct TV. Negotiated over a couple of emails and Zoom calls and papered with a contract chase will have his dad look over before he signs and chase who's made himself as much of a student of the new NIL marketplace as he has a public policy at UCLA says he understands why it's working. A brand ambassador with ship with an athlete is more attractive to these brands now as far as a terminal investment than even a post by a famous actor. If there's any place to learn that sports are deep in the hearts of Americans, it's on a high school football field in Texas. Friday night lights in the Lone Star State might be the great iron equivalent of Frank Sinatra's New York City. Making it there needs your something special. Chase Griffin quarterback class 19, Hadoah, Texas. And Chase didn't just make it, he excelled. Let's talk about some of the top quarterbacks in the state and when you look at that list at the top of it, you got to talk about Chase Griffin. I was lucky to play three years as a quarterback for Hadoah High School, which is a one horse town. We have great success. And so the town really shut down and came out and supported us every Friday night. Chase, right there. He's there. I'd hope that if he can catch it. Nice. He does. Touch it on his head. Chase, one word to describe that finish that game. God, that's it. Coming from a town like that where football is so prioritized, it has its pros and cons, but I think on the pros side, I learned how to win, how to get better. And most importantly, what it's like to build a team where everyone gets better. Emulating his UCLA alumni like Robinson, join your cursesy and Abdolder Bar, Chase is looking at the impact NIL will have not just for him, but the athletes that will follow. When the predecessors who have come before you have changed the world and made life better for everyone today, you can't help but ask yourself how the actions that you're taking now and the companies and brands and the NIL space that you work with are all accumulatively building something greater than any of us could for C. I've actually, I've never moderated, so this will be my first time. It should be fun. I know my handwriting's terrible. The last day the conference chase was asked to co-moderate a panel with Monique Nelson, the CEO for Univ world group. All right.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1156,2022-11-20 10:20:34
18543," And rides terrible. The last day the conference chase was asked to co-moderate a panel with Monique Nelson, the CEO for Univ world group. All right, I'm excited to be here. Univ world group is one of the longest standing multicultural advertising and marketing agencies in the United States. The firm works with brands like Ford, Home Depot, and Johnson & Johnson to help reach the black and brown communities. And they have big ambitions in NIL. For Univ world group, the idea of this was pretty epic in that because we serve the undervalued overlooked and the underserved, we knew that this particular group of people would fall into that category. And we plan on being the premier practice for NIL athletes that are looking to do purpose-driven, media advertising, community level engagement work. UWG launched a program called the NIL to help black student athletes partner with major brands. But to help them understand how to do that, they brought on chase to serve as a student athlete executive in residence. For me, I do nothing without tremendous amounts of data for all of our clients. I really wanted to be thoughtful about this practice being very athlete-centric. If I were to build it or anyone on my team were to build it, it would not have the athlete at the core. When you know you're 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, the best way to have credibility is confidence and the only way for confidence to be authentic. I'm actually learning on the job. I'm learning about the brand side of NIL, but I'm also trying to make sure that empowerment equity is built in, especially for black student athletes in the NIL world. ROI, return on investment. Both Chase and UWG see NIL deals as something much more than making money for students. It's also a potential investment in a community long overlooked. I think we're getting ready to stop boxes, kind of feed the people of L.A. A piece of each of Chase's NIL deals go to his belief brand campaign, which has raised more than $13,000 for meals for the L.A. Food Bank backpack program. But athletes giving back is only one side. I'm here with legal zoom to give you five tips on the NIL game plan. UWG and Chase believe having brands investing in the athletes, especially athletes of color, can be a force multiplier for these historically marginalized communities. When you look at the revenue, JTN rating, sports for the Bombass, 88% of those athletes are black. So when you're doing stuff to empower student athletes in the NIL space, you're also helping to deliver on your promise. Now student athletes are not the only ones who should receive this help by any means. But statistically, by doing that, you're going to be delivering on your mission. Personally, student athletes on average come from lower levels of income. So you're also delivering on that promise. And a lot of these student athletes are first generation, their first gen college students. Some of them first gen high school diploma. Some of them first time receiving the amount of money that they receive in their families. This has been a wild first year in NIL. We all knew that there would be bags of cash around, right? There's always been bags of cash. There's cash everywhere. What we know is that that's not sustainable. We know that athletics has an expiration date on it. So for us, inclusion ultimately means this is just a part of you. It is a tremendous part of you and we are going to celebrate that part of you. But we also know that you're bigger than that. So we want to empower you to live past your expiration date for this part of your life. And quite honestly have equity in everything that you have poured yourself into as an NIL athlete. It may still be the Wild West days for the NIL industry. But in the first year, about a billion dollars in business was done with NCAA athletes.

18544," Steer, about a billion dollars in business was done with NCAA athletes. For the early leaders in the NIL space like Chase, they're striking a precedent for athletes that followed them. And that's important because collegiate athletes don't have that much time to profit. Only an estimated 2% of NCAA athletes go on to the pros. Even the hardest working are often limited by things they can't control. For Chase, it's been his height. I'm 5'10 now in high school after my sophomore year went up through for 3,000 yards. I was probably like 5'6"", 5'5"". I mean, I could already say I'm one the best in the history of Texas high school football. But, you know, I've gone through the height test where they'll call you out of class, shake your hand, look at you up and down. And be like, nice to meet you, you go back to class. It's a sad but timeless story for student athletes. And for Chase, his story is something he's not shyed away from, but embraced when it comes to his NIL deals. I'm frequently the smallest person on the football field, but I always strive to be the most impactful. My middle school coach taught me that I would never play in high school. Chase's deals with degrees breaking limits team and clear covers inspired underdogs allowed him to capitalize financially from football. Even the last season, he never saw the field for UCLA. I play football because I love the game. I play the football because I'm a good competitor. I love to compete and I play football because I'm good at it. At the end of the day, I don't play football for my library hood, which is important to remember when it comes down to identity. I myself, Chase Griffin, as long as I'm that, I got something in this world. As he moves into the new season and focuses more on football than business, Chase doesn't seem much of a differentiation between the two in terms of his mindset. I wouldn't be surprised if I wasn't playing football in five years and it was running in Fortune 500 company, but I also wouldn't be surprised if I was winning a Super Bowl five, ten years from now. And either way, I'm going to keep on working at the tools that would align myself and my future with both. At the end of the day, you're always going to have yourself. If you can make profit off of yourself and know where you add value in any world you're in, you'll be able to adapt and find ways to generate wealth through yourself. Part of what I love about business is you get to build things from nothing. I don't have any investors. All this is all money in. This is me just building it. It's pretty much full service shadow banking with nobody in charge. So as you look back on your career, what would you say is the best investment advice you've ever received? Probably the best investment advice that I never received, but that I lived my whole life around is surround yourself with really good people. I thought about it just today, like I do many times, you know, what makes a great investor? A great investment firm is comprised of people who are optimists and pessimists and realists because in the intersection of the debates that go across that wide range of personalities is where you find truth. It's part of the reason I'm so focused on freedom of expression.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1158,2022-11-20 10:29:13
18545," personalities is where you find truth. It's part of the reason I'm so focused on freedom of expression. I see it my own four walls, the robust and fulsome debates around how we commit our capital, what defines a good idea, what businesses to build or pursue. That's what drives the success at Citadel. And I've been very fortunate in life to have always had a group of friends who really push me, who make me better. And here I get to work with three and a half thousand colleagues who in their ways make me better each and every day and collectively as a team, we've had the opportunity to have an incredible impact on the financial landscape around the world. Why do the biggest names in business choose Bloomberg? It's a great question. It's a great question. It's a great question. It's a great question. It's a great question. I get all night. Bloomberg, top experts, great questions. Imagine simply climbing a cable into space. The concept is known as the space elevator. Not only could it significantly change how we leave planet Earth, but it could also completely transform humanity's relationship with space. And they're a scientist who think we could have already built it. We have the material, we have the technology, we have the lasers, we have the climbers, we have all of it. If a private entity wants to build it or a government, they could build it. It'll change society. We have no clue how colonizing in the space, how really spreading on the space, really change our society over the next 50 to 200 years. It'll be completely different. It's hard to think of any athlete better known or more polarizing than Alex Rodriguez. He's done it again. A three time MVP, 14 time All Star and World Series champion. He retired in 2016 as the highest paid player in MLB history. Fourth all time on the list of home runs. But his playing career isn't likely to be remembered by those statistics or by who he is or isn't dating. The record suspension tonight for baseball star Alex Rodriguez over his use of performance enhancing drugs. You say you did not do these PDs. Are they accusing you of doing it? You're correct Mike. This dude is unbelievable. A phony to the end. While it was the most painful time of my life, it may cost me the hall of fame. And that's on me, nobody else. I think in a weird way I'm going to look back and say that's one of the, also one of the best things that happened. Five years after his retirement, Alex Rodriguez, this CEO, is getting back into sports this time as an owner of a pro basketball team. And he wants to build more than just a franchise, but a legacy, maybe, with a dose of redemption. The mistakes made in baseball are done and I can't go back and fix them. I want to keep a clean record of the father as a friend of the business person. And because of those mistakes, I think I have that opportunity and I'm having the time of my life doing it. Hey Rod Alex Rodriguez is buying the Minnesota Timberwolves and the Minnesota links. The purchase price is expected to be in the ring.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1159,2022-11-20 10:33:41
18546," Hey Rod, Alex Rodriguez is buying the Minnesota Timberwolves and the Minnesota links. The purchase price is expected to be in the range of $1.5 billion. You know for me, I think making the transition from player to owner is something that's very exciting to me. I'm really excited to bring my experience both in business and in sports and in locker room and do really, really exciting things and bring a war championship to the city. In April 2021, Alex Rodriguez joined one of the most exclusive clubs around folks who own a pro sports team. And while his name and his fame made the headlines, it was his business empire that allowed him to actually close the deal. The easy to remember name A-Ride Corp, it's grown into a diversified investor and operator, taking a cue from mega firms like Blackstone and KKR. A-Ride Corp has taken a real estate portfolio and expanded into venture capital and private equity and media. And like any business in 2021, it's own SPAC. I was more lucky than smart. I started investing very small in real estate simply as a hedge to, as my earning power would close, my real estate would not only appreciate what's, but create more cash flow. And then I would take their cash flow and I would buy more real estate and other private equity type investments were generated more cash flow. So as my Yankee income went to zero, hopefully my real estate and my businesses would grow over time. And while players nowadays are becoming better and better business brands, few are able to achieve the scale as A-Ride Corp has in such a relatively short amount of time. But understanding how that growth happened in business, just like baseball, has to start at home. Part of what I love about business is you get to build things from nothing, right? Like nothing. So, I had two hip surgeries and I never wanted to be the old guy that couldn't get up, you know, the stairs. So I built a flat house, all entertainment on that side, my room here, dad and the girls on this side. But it had to be one story because A-I'm always forgetting things. And B-I wanted to want to be like, oh my god. I can't get up the steps because it be sips. Yeah, walk around here, I mean, first of all, the arts are beautiful, but tons of pictures of you and the girls. And I mean, you've really made a family life for yourself here. Tell me about that. Well, tell you what I'm not at home. I'm not a cleanup hitter and I'm not a CEO. They're very good to remind me every day that I work for them. I'm not even seeing why you think this is all. People always ask me, what are you doing in your life? And I say the three Bs, I do baseball and I basketball, two, business and my babies. And that's kind of, that's my happy zone. It's funny, through pandemic, we spend so much time here and in my 46 years, the toughest time in the world that I've witnessed. On the other side of that, we were in here and we felt safe and we felt loved. And it was like 90 days of breakfast, lunch and dinner with my girls. It was a dream come true. They got so sick of my dad jokes. So sick of my dancing. I'm actually at Leesley TikTok. I've been begging, trying to bribe, I let you do one with me. She was daddy, you have no swag, no drip. I'm not doing anything with you. A-Rod's dancing may not get his daughter's approval, but his following on social media is huge with nearly 4 million followers on Instagram alone. That number is larger than his new basketball team, the Yankees or the Red Sox, not to mention any other single baseball player, current or former. Who has better taste in music? Whose room is decorated nicer? What is it that makes you engage the way you do in social? You know Jason, a lot of that came through my time during my suspension. You know, I spent a whole year serving a suspension. And in that time, I had an opportunity to turn the lens inward. And understand why I was making some of the good choices, the poor choices, the bad choices. And understand kind of conversation, understand storytelling. And it's something that I'm enjoying. It's still fairly new. And I must point out I do find it clearer. I must try so long to learn.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1160,2022-11-20 10:38:22
18547," choices, the bad choices, and understand kind of conversation, understand storytelling. And it's something that I'm enjoying is still fairly new. We're not experts by any means. But every time we look at companies or opportunities or partnerships is data driven and social driven and it's been quite a tool for us. That's suspension which obviously people will forever associate you with. And there's an interesting choice you make there at that moment and then in subsequent moments to not lean out, to not retreat, but to lean in to some extent. And especially in the last couple of years, tell me about them. If you think about my career, sure I've hit home runs and been part of a world championship team, but I'm also, I'm fifth all time in the history of strikeouts. I mean that means that only four people in the history of mankind have failed more than me. But I think as a result I've been, you know, PhD in failing but also an MBA of getting back up. Looking around at his house and his selection of cars, it's hard to say that A-Rot has ever really failed. But it's striking what he has built considering where he came from. What do you think of when you think of a battery? For most it's what we use to power devices for both work and play and maybe even your car. Over the past few decades they've gotten way more powerful, long-lasting and affordable. But all of this is just a prologue to what the next batteries are going to do. As we drive to an increasingly renewable power driven grid, we also need to be able to store energy and release it later to cover those periods of weather intermittencies that are driving this new grid that we're in. It's a multi-trillion dollar opportunity and it's imperative that we figure out the solution here. How we store energy on a massive scale is in many ways the central challenge of the fight to stop climate change. Welcome to the world of decentralized finance. Bloomberg's covering all things crypto, the people, the transactions, and the technology. Bloomberg crypto Tuesdays. I was born in New York, raised in Miami so when I got to Miami I was around 8 and a half nine years old. My father left when I was around 10 and at home it was mom, my brother Joe and my sister Shouzi. They took the role of like my brother became like the secretary of sports. My sister became the secretary of education and my mom just had to you know make enough money to pay her bills. I think you know my father leaving us at 10 kind of left a huge vacant spot right and I think I needed to then kind of fill that void by having a collection of mentors. One of those earliest mentors was his baseball coach Rich Hoffman right here at Westminster High School. See vlogs through this this area a few times. Oh yeah. This brings back some pretty cool memories.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1161,2022-11-20 10:42:13
18548," Locks do this, this area a few times. Oh yeah. This brings back some pretty cool memories. If you hit a home run here, it goes to the basketball courts and the pool. Right. And I kind of like it. It's kind of like this Fenway kind of wriggly. Yeah, exactly. Set of the green monster, you have the green pumps. Yeah, exactly. Well, it's really where I really started to understand the power of mentorship and dreaming big. And if you think about it, I have one of the most important conversations with Coach Rich Hoffman. And that happened at 15 the first day I walked on campus. He goes, look, Alex, you're going to come in this year. You're going to have a good year. And then you're going to the junior Olympics to represent the US. You'll do well there. You get much stronger. By that time, you'll be like the top junior in the country. And then your senior year, you're going to be the number one big in the country. And then you're going to be off to the big leagues. Coach, you're talking to me? He goes, yeah, I'm talking to you, Alex. And Jason, I went home that night. And I believe them. It just like it changed my complete vision on me and my future. And then I did everything in my power. And that's how they coached down. So the leader today went and have young people. It's my job to not only give them the opportunity, but to push them and push them to a level where they now see the world in a different way about themselves. That prediction came true. In the 1993 MLB draft, Rodriguez was selected first overall by the Seattle Mariners. And while his playing career was just getting started, by the age of 22, he'd invest in his first piece of real estate. It was what I knew best, my mother. She was in a homeowner. We were renters, right? We were tenants. And every 18 months, we would move because the landlord would always raise the rent. And I remember as a young kid saying, boy, if I can ever trade places with the landlord, and they can be the tenant, that would be amazing. I bought my first duplex. And then I owned that for a few years. I sold it for double by four plaques, eight plaques, 60 units, and an awfully wide. When it came to those first investments, whenever he does something, he's going in at 100%. This is Jose Gomez. Everyone calls him Pepe. Along with Jose More, he's the co-CEO of Newport Property Construction and also a childhood friend of Rodriguez. From 2004 to 2007, we ended up acquiring 5100 units between Florida and Texas. We renovated him. He would buy him. I would renovate them. And the rest was history. Being a real estate investor, especially in high growth markets like Florida, well, it hasn't been a straight line up for the past two decades. Miami's high-rise condos are monuments to a burst property bubble, while Miss Tafor Florida mortgages are underwater. We had this run up to 2007. Prices were going up like this. And then it just fell off a cliff. The great recession crushed owners and developers alike. Few were immune, except those that had other sources of income to take advantage of falling prices. Income likes, say, one of the richest baseball contracts in history. Our huge advantage was that Alex had W2 income coming in from playing. And we had that staying power. So we were able, even when things started going south for some people, we were able to grow within those difficult times. Monument capital management has done within 60 deals since 2012 worth more than $900 million. The extent of that ambition in real estate is evident here at Grand Station in downtown Miami. The 30-story residential tower, complete with a sprawling amenity floor and pool, has sweeping views of downtown. It's a bet on Miami's growth. And it's a bet that's looking smarter as Wall Street firms and other companies look southward. People always question Miami, why do people live there? There's not any great jobs. We don't have a lot of financial services here. We don't have anybody manufacturing anything. But that's changing.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1162,2022-11-20 10:46:46
18549," There's not any great jobs, you know, we don't have a lot of financial services. This is here, we don't have anybody manufacturing anything, but that's changing. People see this as a very cool place to live and work. Now before it was always a cool place to live, but where are you going to work? Now it's okay, the jobs are here first. Cool place to visit in the past. Right, yeah. And now each pocket is being built out. I think our Basel years and years ago started that and then there have been a course of events that have followed that continue to enrich Miami and I would say we're still early as a city. But while Miami may be home base, Rodriguez's most aggressive current real estate project is buying, renovating and renting out single-family homes in markets across the country. And in this case, he's not just emulating some of the world's biggest investors, but also getting into business with them, including real estate legend Barry Sterneley. This is behemoths like Blackstone who've been mass single-family homes. Rodriguez, through the Tyber Capital group, has snapped up 5,000 homes so far. We think we're still in the early endings of single-family housing. Rents are going up about 18 to 19 percent. Once we find something, then this I learned from Warren Buffett is be disciplined, but when you find your pitch, don't go for a single or double, going and going big. That's exactly what we've done multi-family and now with single-family houses. Going big has required Rodriguez to build a team around him and he's opted for a delicate balance of homegrown and outside hires. On the one side, friends dating back to childhood and adolescence, including Aaron, Pepe and Jose. On the other newer additions such as Kelly LaFerieir, Stuart Zook, David Becker, and Lisa Pire. Watching the chemistry among the small and growing team, is akin to the elusive intangibles Rodriguez saw in clubhouses when he was a player. Getting it right, well that's the difference between being a champion and an also ran. Lisa, take it away. So I think next we're going to have David on table from Kelly and VGP is a relationship to the world's end of the club. So teams 11-11 and one exciting development is the 12-17 hymn and selectors is the GnN. So we were not on the Eastern Table in New York. At the A-Word Corp offices, you'll notice the memorabilia, the pictures of famous athletes, the real-time social data being displayed on the TV wall. But you'll also see pictures of Rodriguez with some of the biggest businessmen in the world. Alex has become a sponge and he started that as an active player when he was on the road he would go and visit the Jerry Rines' Dress of the world in his uniform and ask them business questions. And he's surrounded himself with really good smart people. The wide network is critical in sourcing deals, including in the venture world, where the A-Word portfolio has included more than 60 companies, brands like Hems and Hers, Gopuff, and UFC Gems. But having the best team doesn't mean you win every at bat. Their SPAC, SLAM Corp, was recently negotiating a roughly $3 billion deal to merge with a collectible company, Penini, that didn't materialize after Penini stumbled. SLAM's still in search of a target. But Rodriguez's belief in taking swings, striking out and hitting big, is also the same way he would end up with his own sports franchise.

I love Mark I love him like a brother and he's he's a great partner and a great friend and you know he's slipped to my house I sleep at his house and we both have this drive and this mission that I want him to win in the worst way and I think he does the same for me. I want to show you this clip because it spoke to me a lot about the depth of your relationship. Yeah I think this is getting a little bit deeper now but I think it comes down to our dads you know they both felt like you know we had something to prove in order to to sort of feel love really and and when you did something spectacular you felt oh maybe you know like and I think he similarly had that felt that too where if you wanted to feel love you had to do big things. What do you make of that? I never thought about it that way but I know that when my father left at 10 it left a huge hole in my heart and my stomach and I knew that I had to do better and I think before therapy it was probably better for the wrong things I think post and current I look at it as just my purpose but I also know that I'm enough now and probably before that I thought it wasn't. The deep connection with Lori led to a new 400 million dollar venture fund called VCP and notably allowed them to quickly pivot to a successful deal in sports ownership they're pursuit of the Minnesota Timberwolves and Minnesota links. He called me and he said hey are you serious about this? He said I won't do it unless you're serious about it and I said I'm serious about it are you serious about it? And again a minute conversation we're both in and we probably got the deal done in six or seven days. NBA ownership has radically transformed into the past decade. It's tech executives like Steve Balmer and Joe Sye and Wall Street investors like Mark Lazzari, Josh Harris and Tony wrestler have snapped up teams.

18551," Good would own a professional sports team and there's very high barriers to entry and very limited supply. In the case of the Timber Wolves, Glenn Taylor bought the team in 1994 for $88 million. The sale to Rodriguez's group values the franchise paired with the four-time WNBA champion links at $1.5 billion. And that's relatively affordable. A Rod's old team, the Yankees, is worth more than $5 billion, according to several estimates. And while ownership is changing, so too are the players. I think players today want more in every sport. They're into fashion. They want to be good investors. They want to learn about venture. The NBA players today that I've been around, some of them are more prepped at 20 than some of the guys that I played with at WNBA 50. And meeting with our athletes and talking about business and them reaching out to me, it's great, it's humbling, and it's really impressive. And if anything, their ownership has maybe gotten too close to the players. The team being fined $250,000 for violating league rules with an off-season workout in A Rod's hometown of Miami. But buying a basketball team instead of the meds might accomplish a goal he thought was unreachable, actually making him cool to his daughters. I recently went to a Sixers game. And my little one Ella, who's 13, she closed that really like this basketball thing. Like one day, maybe I get to run the business here one day. Really? And I was like, oh my god, that's like the greatest thing I've ever heard. And she goes, you know, it's like, you know, baseball's a little slower, but this stuff, I can really get into it. I said, whoa, baseball's great too. It's just, you know, it's more of a thinking man's game. It's like chess, not checkers. And she goes, yeah, yeah, whatever. I don't like chess either. But she says, this basketball thing, I have like real passion is like the entertainment. And I have thoughts and I have ideas. And I, and she thinks much more like a producer, she likes dancing. And I mean, to me, that's just like, boy, that's the great thing about sports and music. It brings people together. And it certainly did that for us that night. You have built this, this amazing business. You know, there are people who are watching this. Just like this guy, you know, it's like that they'll always remember you for your baseball career. And a baseball career that was this controversial to say the least. You could be a little bit on an island somewhere. You don't have to do this. I thought about tapping out a bunch of times. I would wake up in the middle of the night and be in tears going like, how in the world do I get pocket aces and figure out a way to screw this up. That was a very painful time for me. And I think the year suspension allowed me to not only put lipstick on the house and paint it. And fix the windows. It allowed me to tear the entire house down and start building it one brick at a time. And in that process, I became even closer to my daughters. And when I think about those mistakes and the lessons learned, I think about, okay, but you know what? That was baseball. And I had good moments and I had very tough moments. But clean slate when it comes to being a father, to being a partner, to being a businessman, to being a friend. So I draw some incredible motivation through something that sucked, something that I did to myself. I say to myself, in the darkest hour, boy, if I ever get another opportunity, I'm not going to screw that up again. And I'm trying my best not to do that. I'm trying my best not to do that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1165,2022-11-20 10:59:43

So apodosaurus is an example. Now, there's had really long skinny tails. So I made a computer model that showed that in fact the tail of these sauropod dinosaurs could actually act like a whip, a bullfip. Now, the way a bullfip makes that cracking noise is because the tip of the whip actually goes about twice the speed of sound. And that crack is a sonic boom. I think the way they got a date was to impress the females by making loud booms. There are the vanguard of a green transition. They're delivering locally in a time of global energy turmoil. Utility companies are having their moment in the sun. Energy is on every once mind around the world. Energy independence, energy prices, energy availability. Utilities historically have been viewed as stodgy, slow moving, boring companies. I would not be here if it were anything like that. The utilities that are going to thrive in this environment are the ones who have a diversified energy mix, particularly the ones who have a high percent of clean energy resources that is reliable such as nuclear, as well as wind and solar and make a gas in the mix to back those up. Duke Energy providing regulated gas and electric services to about 10 million customers in seven US states has flourished in the spotlight. Revenues have rebounded since COVID rocked the industry in 2020. The volatility that's driven profits has also created pressures. We're in a period of inflation. We're in a period where commodity prices are high. So every season of leadership is going to have some particular challenge. And Duke will meet these challenges with fresh leadership. After almost a decade at the helm of finance, Steve Young decided to step away from the role. In September 2022, company veteran Brian Savoy became CFO. Why now retire from your position as CFO? I thought it was time. It made a lot of sense. Brian is ready. Succession planning is something that is ongoing at Duke Energy. And this gave us an opportunity to promote Brian, someone who has great financial background, good market and economic background, who also has led businesses, so understands P&L. And so it just felt like the right time to begin that transition. The transition in the C suite comes as duken barks on a transformation of its business. Aiming to retire all cold by 2035, achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and reshape its portfolio around natural gas, nuclear power and renewables. We're basically rebuilding generation and transmission and distribution to meet the needs of the future.

18553," Rebuilding generation and transmission and distribution to meet the needs of the future. We're going to invest $145 billion over a decade. That is a staggering amount of money, which means it's a staggering amount of things we've got to go buy, replace, install, make work, and do it in an affordable way for our customers. That's a tall order. It's a team effort. So, Voi will have plenty of support from Young, who's now Duke's Chief Commercial Officer and Lin Good, who is once Duke's the FO herself. Any advice you want to give them from your CFO hat? CFO hat, you can't give advice. The CFO hat. The advice I gave him was jump in with all fours and make this job as big as you can, because you sit at the nexus of so many things in the Chief Financial Officer role. The business, the regulation, the finance, delivering value to investors and to customers. And I think Brian is very capable of doing that. It's an amazing time to be in this role in this moment. Stressful? Extremely. And daunting. There's a lot going on, but I wouldn't have it any other way. Here's what Duke's Power Generation mix looked like in 2021, with coal and oil nearly a quarter of the portfolio. Here's how it should look by 2030. Renewables will more than triple as a share of the company's power output. We have been putting pieces in place in our regulated business for several years to really accelerate this clean energy transition. Renewables bring price stability because there's no fuel. Right? See, there's a sun shine or the wind. There's typically a significant capital of front investment, but it's predictable. Natural gas is needed to balance the grid and the reliability needs because the wind doesn't blow all the time and the sun doesn't shine all the time. The batteries can't bridge the gap enough. Right? So our plan is to reduce natural gas over time, but use it as a bridge fuel as we proliferate renewables and nuclear has been just a tremendous benefit for our customers. And we see promise in future nuclear in the 2030s as we move through transition. That's not the only transition Brian's avoid will manage. Duke wants to focus its time, money and resources on its regulated businesses and it's looking for a buyer for its commercial renewable energy holdings. Our commercial business is one that I ran, so I'm very familiar with, and it served us very well, but it is only 5% of our company. Right? And our regulated business has a clear path to growth and the competition for capital spheres inside our company. And there are a lot of a lot of interest. There's a lot of money wanting to invest in green energy. They are performing a strategic review right now of this business and I think it makes sense to do so. Because in the utility space to really get credit in evaluation for a non-regulated business, such as renewable generation, right? You have to do it at a much larger scale. And it does make sense to take a closer look at maybe somebody else's a better sort of capital here in the recycled capital to redirect that into the regulated business. Duke forecast earnings growth the 5-7% through 2026 driven by a lot of capital investment. The company intends to spend a whopping 145 million dollars in the next decade, with a lion's share going to changing its energy mix and modernizing its grid. Brian Savoy is in charge of deploying this capital under highly challenging conditions, including the highest inflation and most volatile energy prices in decades. When you get a surprise like half-year prices, we need to adjust things like O&M. And so work with operations and the relationships I have throughout the company are positioning me well to help influence our operators to adjust their cost as we need to for customers. Do you feel that reducing costs right now while also increasing spending is different than in the past because of the inflationary pressures because of the energy transition? I would say yes. There are a lot of pressures on the business that we might have had in short spells in the past, but it feels more systemic that we're going to see inflation for some time.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1167,2022-11-20 11:08:18
18554," business that we might have had in short spells in the past, but it feels more systemic that we're gonna see, inflation for some time, higher commodity prices. With the kind of volatility, if someone comes to you and say, hey, Brian, so I need some more money for my division to do this. Are you like the no guy? Or are you able to be really nimble and make sure you can be the yes guy? I would say, I'm the, how can we? Okay. Okay. But if we say yes to a request that was emergent, we gotta say, notice some other things. So how do we prioritize and make it all work? CEO and former CFO Lynn Good knows how hard this balancing act can be. I think anytime you're trying to balance, you get pulled in various directions. There will be a pull to build more renewables by certain of our stakeholders. There will also be a pull not to go that fast because it could be too expensive. Maybe our industrial customers are worried about price, full-on-able customers worried about price. So trying to strike that right balance with policymakers, with customers, with investors is a challenge in any moment, and there'll be a challenge in this one. Take me inside some of the conversation you guys are having a Duke right now. So you and Lynn and other C-sweeings that could have been sitting around on table, when do you guys talk about most right now? Supply chain has been a moving target of issues, right? Last year at this time, we were looking at solar panels and how do we lock in our solar panels that we need for the next several years to ensure we can execute the clean energy transition. It has moved to different components like transformers, which are essential for the grid, interest rates, and the pace at which the Fed is moving interest rates is something we talk about each and every week. And when will that flatten out, and how will that impact our business? We are a very large debt issuer. So we watch this extremely closely because it affects our cost structure. Do you want to wait until interest rates level off and then is that delay your capital raising to deploy your plan? We don't wait, but we do plan. There's opportunistic times to issue debt. We will go with larger pieces or versus smaller. And we can work with the length of the debt, right? If 10 year is price more attractive than 20 or 30, we'll use the 10 or to optimize the interest rate. That's all I knew, yeah? Yes. Coming up, Ryan Savoy takes me to the room where it happens. An expert team gathers data and makes decisions that keep dukes renewables running smoothly. They're looking for the smallest change in output because every megawatt hour is money. This is Bloomberg. Japan's critical role in the global economy is changing as the world recalibrates. After decades of stagnation, Japan's leaders are forging a more innovative and sustainable path forward to revitalize the nation. Corporate giants, policymakers, and pioneers tell us how they're doing just that. Every week on Japan ahead, right here on Bloomberg Television. Brian Savoy is taking on a new challenge as he steps into the CFO position at Duke Energy. It's really just his latest challenge. He's touched virtually every area of the company over the last two decades. I started my career at Duke in Houston and our trading business. And I was with Deloitte Tuches before I joined Duke, because one of my clients. You know, what I saw in Brian was tremendous enthusiasm and energy. He was ready to take on new assignments. He was thinking about advancing the ball for the corporation as opposed to any personal goals. And that came through. He helped us on a number of complex projects. And the more we gave him, the more he continued to grow. I've had five different roles in 10 years. And I've seen different parts of the company from transformation, leading natural gas and commercial strategy. This has prepared me for the role I have today. What's the advice that you've given him? You know, I've told him a couple of times, you're not going to get a home run at every ad bat. There's going to be days where things go wrong. The patient, become, keep your eye on.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1168,2022-11-20 11:12:45
18555," Things go wrong. The patient become, keep your eye on the ball for the future, the thing you want to get to eventually. You'll have bumps in the road. Fixing things that go wrong and smoothing out bumps in the road is what customers expect from energy providers. And for Duke's renewable assets, that process is overseen from one room in an office building in Charlotte, North Carolina. Ryan Savoy showed me around the company's Renewable Control Center. This is where operators are monitoring and managing over 5,000 megawatts of renewables across the United States. How would this differ from like a conventional asset monitoring center? Yeah, so assets historically, they would have the monitoring center on site. So you might have an operator with screens, but at the site. Whereas this we can do 90 sites. There's offshore wind, onshore wind, solar. And they're looking for the smallest change in output, because every megawatt hour is money. You put an asset in, let's say it's 100 megawatts. You expect to get 100 megawatts each and every hour that the resource is there. The resource could be sunshine or it could be wind. And when you get 90 or 80, you're not producing what you can. And it can be because the asset isn't working properly. Maybe something hit the turbine blade on the wind bar. Maybe the solar panel has debris on it. Or it could be the solar intensity is not quite there. When one of these assets isn't producing full capacity, we're putting another resource on it. And we're having to toggle this on a consistent basis. And this has clouds come. This is by the minute. This is not, or the hour it's off now. It's by the minute. And then it'll fall, come back. And we have assets that follow this digitally as well, so that we can keep a consistent flow of electrons on the grid. The operators in this room can respond to incoming data with immediate action, remotely controlling wind turbines, solar panels, and batteries. It's another example of using digital and technology tools to make us more efficient, to make us more productive, minimizing the amount of people we have to have, running around and observing, and giving us the statistics to really be able to maintain and monitor those facilities. We couldn't see degradation and output as fast as we do now with the technology and the digitalization of the system. Now, we still need technicians nearby. And so we use traveling crews that can go, say, sites in Kansas versus sites in South Texas versus Central Texas and across the West. We have around the clock shifts, but about 20 people rotate through these shifts. And again, recovering 90 sites, we got about half a dozen people here at any given time managing it. You could think that would scale at over time as renewables grow in the United States. So would you say that as you invest more in renewables, it's a hardware thing or a software thing? Like where do you think we spend the most money doing that? Obviously, the software will continue to improve over time. And the sensors on the equipment are very important to, again, identify those degradation and output, but it's deploying the hardware, deploying the assets on the ground, getting the sites ready, connecting to the grid is a huge lift. Duke's hardware and software mix keeps evolving, and so does its workforce. Retooling also means retraining. We've moved people to the renewable space. Some of these folks used to be in coal. We've moved people to software security, which is a growing area that we need more and more. Because as everything gets digitized, there's more opportunities for bad actors to penetrate. So we need high-super security skills. And when you match that with operating skills, you really have a beautiful mix that makes a strong, strong operator. Operators here have plenty of micro details to keep track of, but there's a macro factor on their minds as well. That's the weather. We have absolutely not a stage just to give the operators a bearing of what's going on in the country. And we have plotted on it where our renewable sites are, so they know if there's a weather pattern, weather system coming, I expect that in that area. How do you manage extreme weather? So let's say we have a wind farm in the west, and a wind storm is coming. Yeah. The assets will turn off when the wind speeds exceed a certain level automatically. OK. And because there's risk of...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1169,2022-11-20 11:17:06
18556," You know the assets will turn off when the wind speeds exceed a certain level automatically. Okay. Because there's risk of breakage of the blades and damage to people and assets and stuff. We know a windstorm is coming that might damage the solar or a hail storm for instance, right? We can watch those assets closer, we can put a crew on site, but this team would be dispatching those crews onto the location. And that's where like the weather map on the team like really works. Yeah, that's right. From hurricanes in the southeast to wildfires in the west, extreme weather events are becoming more prevalent and more intense. Utility companies are bracing for greater risk. When we think about the impacts of extreme weather events on the grid, large group connect and resources would still such as large-scale solar farms and large-scale wind farms would still rely on the centralized grid to deliver electricity to the load centers. So to the extent that the grid is knocked out by a hurricane, those assets would go offline as well. So in addition to investing in green generation resources, it's extremely important that companies pay attention to grid hardening measures. We're seeing more of it, more frequency of severe events and how we predict those, monitor those and estimate the damage using data analytics and machine learning to say, how many customers might be out of this happens, what generators are at risk, and all that modeling goes into our planning for what we put our investments. We talked about the capital plan earlier. All those investments are informed by the climate trends that we see across our system. Coming up, Duke's Clean Energy Plans get a major boost from DC with the Inflation Reduction Act. The boy is already working through the possibilities. For example, 1000 megawatts of solar equates to about 60 million in annual production tax credits. This is Bloomberg. Big expensive cities have a lot going for them. But if you live in one, you probably notice that these big expensive cities keep getting more well expensive. You could always move away. You might have just started working remotely, so there's really nothing keeping you there. But then again, moving is a hassle. Well, what if someone paid you 10 grand to do it? What if they threw in free office space, a bicycle, or a gym membership? Programs and cities and states around the US are doing exactly that, and they're getting a lot of interest. We had over 50,000 applications. We had over 1800 applicants from all over North America. So are these nascent programs actually beneficial to their communities and the workers joining them? Or are they little more than flashy advertising campaigns for places looking for an injection of fresh talent? No one covers the world like Bloomberg. So Bloomberg? – The next decade for Duke Energy is pretty clearly mapped out. Raise and spend $145 billion on a massive clean energy transition. The bulk of those investments and regulated businesses while investigating the-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1170,2022-11-20 11:21:40
18557," transition, put the bulk of those investments into regulated businesses while investigating the sale of non-core assets to fund that push. It'll all be up to new CFO Brian Savoy to execute this plan and make sure it delivers optimal financial growth. The motion is adopted. Congress passed the inflation reduction act in August putting provisions in place that make his task more manageable. The inflation reduction act provides incentives for renewables, it provides incentives for battery storage and it provides incentives for nuclear. All of those incentives for a regulated company go right to our customers. They reduce directly the price of our product. So when I build a renewable product it's going to cost me less and it'll cost my customers less. It's going to help our renewable transition. For example, 1,000 megawatts of solar equates to about 60 million in annual production tax credits. We're going to have 30,000 megawatts of renewables on our system by 2035. The inflation reduction act has been a very important piece of legislation. It's not only that it creates a number of incentives for a variety of assets, right? It also is very durable in long term. So instead of a patchwork of different tax credits that we've seen in the past, it actually creates a light path going well into 2030s for this long term transition on the grid. Political winds may shift and regulations are always subject to change. For the moment, policy in Washington aligns with Duke's strategic goals. It's like there's a plural partnership now. We have a voice at the table. I have a lot of conversations with the Treasury Department about about tax policy and as they define the rules around the IRA, they will seek input from people like us and we will weigh in. This is what you should think about as you write the detailed rules to implement this this act. When it comes to relationship between utility and policy makers and regulators, those have always been extremely important. Those utilities that cultivate have cultivated those relationships in a constructive fashion where they've been good stewards of capital and operate the system well and took into consideration interest of various stakeholders in addition to the equity and debt investors, of course. Those materials enjoy relationships with the regulators in our experience, right? And that over time translates into constructive rate outcomes and better recovery mechanism. Recovery mechanisms are set at the state level. They also help companies and customers absorb the capital costs of the clean energy transition. We cannot adjust our price without working through regulators and modern recovery mechanisms allow us to adjust price more frequently and align with our investments so that when the investments start causing expenses, revenues follow and there's alignment. Otherwise we call it regulatory lag where you have expenses before we can earn revenues on those assets. Historically we would build up investments, then have what's called a rate case and have a large increase in one one slug. The modern recovery mechanisms place assets and service each year essentially. So your smoothing rate increases over time so customers can plan better and we can plan better. Even with meticulous planning and regulatory tailwinds, US utilities must proceed with caution. Europe's energy crisis highlights the fight between green energy and energy security, raising questions about how fast and hard the world can pivot. There's been criticisms saying Europe that they were trying to go too fast into renewables for example and therefore they left out nuclear and they sort of shuttered coal plants and now they're paying the price in that respect. What's the right pace? I think the pace is maintaining balance with reliability and affordability. That's the only way we know to to gauge pace. We will not put a plan together then we don't have a high degree of confidence we can serve our customers every hour, every season and we have to keep an eye on affordability. We call it a responsible balance transition. The transition away from fossil fuels is coming. I mean, just think about coal. Five years ago you could get as much coal as you want. Now coal is constrained and it's going to become even more constrained. So operating coal assets is not even going to be an option as we move through time. The convergence of energy independence and security I believe is coming soon. That's the state of play for Brian Savoy as he starts his tenure as Duke's CFO. I asked him what he sees when he looks ahead. What is the biggest opportunity over the next 10 years as CFO that you're most...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1171,2022-11-20 11:25:57
18558," As he starts his tenure as Duke's CFO, I asked him what he sees when he looks ahead. What is the biggest opportunity over the next 10 years as CFO that you're most excited about? Over the next decade, I feel like utilities have a moment to really make a mark on society. And again, it's long-lasting, it's going to be for our grandkids and their grandkids. So putting the utility sector in prominence of the world, that's what I want to do. What's the biggest challenge? What are you most worried about in the next 10 years in doing your job? I think the biggest challenge is balancing investment. The investments we need to make and the transition in front of us with the cost to customers. Because the oversight of our regulators is only getting more and more and more. And we've got to be more clear on the customer benefits of every dollar we spend that turns into value for customers. And I can see this playing out in just hand-to-hand combat over the next decade. And we will work it. And we believe the investments we're making will meet that bar. What is the skill that you have as CFO that you think will help that? I'm wired for value. I don't like waste at all. And when I see things that we need to change, I have the courage to make it happen. And as CFO, I'm in a position to really move that and Duke. And what's a new skill set of knowledge that you're excited about over the next 10 years? I would say the new skill set would be how to balance all of the external views of the company with the internal. I've worked inside this company and have great influence. But ensuring that similar level of influence is out in the external world. What's the best advice you've received coming into CFO? You know, I will go back many years ago, over 10 years ago, I was working for Lynn. And she told me, Brian, the skills you have positioned you for a wide range of roles. I had no idea what that meant. Then this was like 2009. But as I've looked at my career and she has moved me to gain experience across Duke in the right areas of operations and strategy, that advice back then, I didn't appreciate, but I appreciate it now more than ever. I'm Alex Steele. This is Bloomberg. I'm Alex Steele. You're one of the most fascinating entrepreneurs because you all started with young. What did you learn? Did you always think that you'd be an entrepreneur? Probably, yes. I think, which is a bit sad. From age what? Five? It is. I'm not sure. I come from a family of entrepreneurs. So even though I probably can spell the word and still can't indicate it, it's sort of in my blood. It's really fun starting a business. I feel it's a real privilege. I started my business officially at 18, but I knew I wanted to do it very differently from about 15. But I'm sure it's if you're surrounded by it, it feels very natural. So yes, it's fun. And it started how you started by making you want to Florence. It was an Italy and you started handbags. I knew I was actually given a handbag by my mother when I was about 61 of her old handbags. How it made me feel. And I think fashion is fascinating for the mood changing, the confidence boosting aspects. There's a tribal aspects of what fashion does. And so I went at 18 to Florence knowing that was the home of Lebhagus, which is what interested me. I just wanted to learn actually and be surrounded by craftsmen who are making things as important. And that's going to be very interesting, I think, over the next sort of ten years. I think the on-shoring of craft and manufacturing is going to be fascinating. When I watched the off-shoring, I literally saw it. And I think we're going to be seeing that coming back to local. We have to. When we're all looking at our objectives in terms of carbon, proximity is going to be key. It is crucially important. And I think we've moved from this attitude from its endolgence a waste of time, almost an illness that needs a cure.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1172,2022-11-20 11:30:13
18559," It is crucially important and I think we've moved from this attitude, from its indulgence, a waste of time, almost an illness that needs a cure. For something as universally important to human life as sleep, mysteries surrounding its necessity and utility have only just been recently uncovered. Some of our biggest discoveries were in the 1970s or 1980s, and so it makes that a really exciting field, because it seems as though we're uncovering new insights each and every day. Some scientists are going further to find out how sleep and what happens there can be harness to further expand our understanding. It's easy to memorize things that makes you smart if you can spit back a lot of facts, but if you want to be wise, if you really want wisdom, you've got to know when and how and why to use that information. And that's what you bring to figure out while you're sleeping. You've got to explain this one to me. What does it mean when the White House says we're watching markets carefully? It means they have a Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. They have been and seen it. Lots of Bloombergs. Lots of Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. What does it mean? What does it mean? What does it mean? It means they have a Bloomberg. This is Bloomberg Daybreak with Link. Welcome to Daybreak Australia. This is Hannah DeCloser. Welcome to Bloomberg crypto. Welcome to the earth shot prize innovation summit. I'm Francing Lackwai here at the Plaza Hotel in New York City. This event powered by Bloomberg featured finalists selected by the earth shot council, launched by Prince William. The shot is a global initiative that drives innovation on solutions to climate change and environmental issues in the following categories. Protect and restore nature. Clean our air, revive our oceans, build a waste free world, fix our climates. So over the next half an hour we'll bring you all the highlights from this most important gathering. This is Bloomberg. Protecting the environment was of course close to my grandmother's heart. And I know you should have been delighted to hear about this event and the support you're all giving our earth shot finalists. The next generation of environmental pioneers. Together in this room are the people and organisations who will help us to achieve the earth shot mission to repair, restore and rejuvenate our planet within this current decade. That mission is not simple. Just as President John F. Kennedy so famously said, as he challenged the United States for America to unite behind the goal putting man on the moon, we choose to do these things not because they are easy but because they are hard. I know that the world is an uncertain place right now that many families and communities across the globe are facing unimaginable challenges, from conflicts to energy crisis and food shortages. While addressing these in the short term we must also remain resolutely focused on tackling the greatest challenges that threaten our tomorrow. Because if we don't the changing climate will only serve to entrench these immediate challenges into fundamental global issues, severely impacting the lives of each and every one of us. That is why our collective mission is so urgent. But there is huge reason to be optimistic. The 2021 cohort of earth shot winners and finalists is evidence that we can succeed. That we can protect our world for our children, our grandchildren and the generations that will follow them. These pioneers exemplify the leadership needed in this decade of change. They include inspiring activists, brilliant innovators, a forward-thinking city and even an entire country making a real difference. But they cannot do it alone. This must be a team effort. We must come together behind their innovative solutions to ensure they reach their full potential with pace and scale.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1173,2022-11-20 11:34:29
18560," Te Mephaut. We must come together behind the innovative solutions to ensure they reach their full potential with peace and scale. While my message today is one of gratitude and encouragement, I also acknowledge that you cannot succeed in isolation. As governments, we have a responsibility to create the incentives and the space for you to flourish, a receptive environment for change and the accountability that comes with guardianship. In many nations, the foundation for this approach has been flayed for us long ago if we choose to listen. Where I come from, I'll tear down New Zealand, a beautiful place to must visit. Our indigenous people hold a world view that every single living and non-living thing is connected. Our people, our plants, our animals, descendants have run in the sky, father and papa to our nuku, their earth mother and their children. And so it follows that people and nature are kin, are family. And we must care for one another in the spirit of kaitiaki tanga, which translates into guardianship by the people of the land for the next generation. In short, and the environment is me. Our life source, our economy, our future. Now, I've seen this in action first hand many times, not least in my own backyard, the Pacific, where the ocean is a source of protein, income, culture and connection. Now, it is a source of challenge as it rises up and begins to inundate small island nations. It can be confronting to hear and see the stories of just how real these challenges are, but none of us are here because we have given up. But because we believe there is a way to change the future. We are not only part of the nature, but we are nature. Nature is living element. For indigenous people, nature is whole. Our planet is alive. The rivers are her blood. The trees are her hair. The soil, her skin, the wind, her breeze. And indigenous peoples, our planet, they know, they are the doctor. We are protecting 80% of the world's biodiversity because our way of life do not harm nature at the opposite. We are strengthening ecosystems. We improve biodiversity by cooperating with the birds and trees, listening to the winds, observing the cloud, learning from even the little insect. We protect nature by setting up our own limits. We don't take more that mother earth can give and we give back. We protect the sacred trees. We don't destroy the field of the medicinal plants. We choose, pre-susely, the animal that we can kill to just keep the balance of the ecosystem. As all of us know in this fight, no one can afford to sit on the sidelines. No one can claim that climate change is somebody else's problem or to forget off for future generations to address. We're all affected by a warming planet. We see that every day. And decisions being made right now will determine our shared tomorrow. So we must choose and we must act as united nations ourselves. Our progress depends on collective action. On collective ingenuity, if we stick together, we can make fixing the climate the greatest project and greatest achievement of our lifetimes. We have the science. We have the solutions. Now all the world needs is political will. Together, we can create a future where rampant carbon is removed from the atmosphere, where green buildings and green business transform the levability of communities, where easy access to renewable energy enables greater equity. We're sustainable.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1174,2022-11-20 11:38:47
18561," transform the levability of communities. Where easy access to renewable energy enables greater equity. Where sustainable agriculture feeds a growing global population. The needs are urgent. And the costs of inaction are worse than any nightmare. But let us not be driven by, let us be driven by hope, not fear, by optimism, not despair. Because hope is not passive. Hope is the ultimate source of renewable energy. Pushing us forward every day to try and try again. Today, the Earth Shop Prize Innovation Summit in partnership with Mike Bloomberg and Bloomberg Philanthropies will ask each and every one of us what we can do to accelerate progress to repair our planet this decade. And offer solutions on how to collaborate to drive this ambitious but essential climate agenda. We will continue to drive impact around system changing climate solutions and amplify the Earth Shop Prize's call to accelerate progress to repair our planet through collaboration and innovation. But most importantly, we will remind ourselves what can be achieved when we turn pessimism to optimism and optimism into action. Coming up, more from the panelists and finalists here at the Earth Shop Prize Innovation Summit. This is Bloomberg. We will never break. We will never break. Build on a foundation strong enough to stay. We will never break. Have the water rises and the mountains shake. All of us will remain. We will never. No, no, we will never.

Yeah, it's too bad you can't do things overnight in either mitigation adaptation. When I last went through Europe, people were the leaders were all saying, hey, give me technologies so I can tell Putin to get lost. And I said, hey, in five years, you're going to be able to call him up. And they were like, no, we'd like it. No. It's the year alone.

18562," Red, seeds typically between the timing start and they get out in the farmers fields is about eight years. Now we have a pipeline of innovations. We've been funding the CG system for 20 years now. It's funded about a billion a year. It's if people care at all about adaptation, that thing will be funded at two billion a year. I mean, there won't be anything close to the impact of climate-related seeds, climate-related maize, rice, wheat, sort of a millet. And thank goodness, because of human genetics, we know how to do the editing. Thank goodness because of AI, we know how to find the alleles. Because of drones, we can measure stuff in the field. So there's huge advance in terms of how the whole seed ecosystem moves at full speed. The timing is very tricky here. The warming doesn't stop the day you get to zero emissions. There's a lag in this system. It's about a 20-year lag. So you haven't seen that Earth Tempures not equilibrated to the atmospheric CO2 content. So when you get to zero, it's not like 2051. Take my air conditioner away. No, it starts quite a bit later. And so you have to look at what the peak is and you can't just plan for OK, 2030, 2030s where your maize production in central Africa is down 25%. By 2050, it's down 70%. And you will have switched in most of those areas from a fairly heat-sensitive crop to sorghum. Now sorghum productivity is super low. So we'll get people to do better maize for these next 15 years. And then they are going to have to switch to sorghum. It is tough when you see the floods impact us down. And nobody expected that. If the goal of climate was to make us pay attention, wow, that is way beyond expectation. So some adaptation money literally will just be disaffirmed to recovery money. The boundary of what's also pretty confusing. I mean, what is food aid? If climate's causing some food production losses, all world-proofed-program money is that all climate adaptation money? It's certainly the need for it's going up. That's a system that's about 6 1.5 billion a year. So relative to the systemic solution, which is the research piece, it's relatively larger, but the demand for that piece, which is the acute half a Pakistani rice got flushed away. And so you're going to have malnutrition problems if you don't go in for that. That's also a type of adaptation. And so I do think we're going to bring some rigor to this because the pressure now, the goal of doubling the adaptation money from, they say, 20 billion here to 40 billion here. The pressure on that is still peanuts. No, it's very small. I mean, literally, yeah, if you start sticking food aid in there, you can use it up very quickly, rebuilding after hurricanes. I mean, we had hurricanes before, but the costs there are absolutely gigantic. There are ways of stopping wildfires. There are ways of dealing with sea level rise. So the innovation agenda, not just on seeds, the innovation agenda is going full speed on mitigation. That's where there's 100 companies break through energy's funded. And so by mitigation, you mean mostly energy. You mean everything to do with energy. You mean generation of energy, you mean batteries, you mean transport, you mean all of the new, and there's some renewables that are already traditional, but more that need to come on. So that's the package that you're talking about mitigation. Or are you also talking about agriculture as mitigation? Yeah, so every area of emissions, the world tends to focus on passenger cars and electricity. That's not a third of emissions. And so the focus on the easiest third now.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1176,2022-11-20 11:47:48
18563," to focus on past near cars and electricity. That's not a third of emissions. And so the focus on the easiest third, now 4% of new cars are electric. So that's the field that we're further still long. About 4% of energy generation is wind and solar. And as you triple the size of your grid, you want that to be say, some people would say 100%, other people might say 70% to 80%. But the amount you have to build, we're not within a factor of 5 of the build rate of those. But those are the easy sectors. Cement, clean cement costs over twice as much as the way we make cement today. And it's not, it's partly the heating energy. It's partly the basic thing, remembering chemistry. When you take calcium carbonate and heat it, you get calcium. That's what makes cement. But the thing that goes away, that's CO2. And so we have to have a way of making cement, which a number of these innovative. And a steel and iron. There's a whole family of hard to obeyed sectors. That's true. If you get a dead industrial sector, if you get green hydrogen that's cheap enough, it actually solves quite a large number of those. Some of the industrial processes should go straight to electricity. And some you go through, you do your reduction using the hydrogen, where you would have used some hydrocarbon concept before. For steel, we actually have companies doing both. We have electric steel and others doing electricity is the way of replacing the blast furnace. And then we have others that take hydrogen. And if you get the hydrogen cheap enough, you get the super magic thing, which is that the green product doesn't cost more. That's called green premium equals zero. And then your adoption scale is utterly different. If we tried to subsidize steel and cement, say rich countries say, OK, we want to get rid of that, which goes to our 15% of emissions, that's greater than all foreign aid budgets put together. It's over 200 billion foreign aid. Never will pass that number. It's just not politically possible. It's a number that's at about 170 and going down today. Coming up, but more from the panelists, send finalists here at the Earth's Shop prize innovation side. This is Bloomberg. Hydrogen has a very special place in the universe. It's the first element on the periodic table. It is the most abandoned element in the universe. And when clean energy advocates think about what can we find, which would be as easy to use as fossil fuels, they think about hydrogen. The fuel that will, when burn, only produce water. We like to imagine that if we just built enough of these and these, we could ditch fossil fuels and save the planet. Unfortunately, it's not that simple. There are some things where you just need a good old-fashioned combustible fuel. Now startups around the world are betting that hydrogen can become the fuel of the 21st century. Watch Bloomberg surveillance early edition for the news you need when you need it. A manly little cately lines in New York and N-Adwords in London. Australia's Central Bank raises interest rates twice as much as Bulkars. Then surveillance for in-depth analysis. Outside Tom Keane and Lisa Brownbitt, some Jonathan Ferro, the RPA, Fronts and Senses. And Japan get away with not raising rates. Can it sustain its normal at a time when everybody else is facing a very different way out? Bloomberg surveillance. Be informed. Be prepared. Be ahead of the game.

Finalists of the annual award appeared alongside special guests, including worldwide business leaders, philanthropists, and",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1177,2022-11-20 11:51:51
18564," And will award a peer alongside special guests, including worldwide business leaders, philanthropists, and non-governmental activists. Now while the 2022 finalists have been announced, our panelists have their eyes on the future, and here's what they have to say. This is the Earthshot Decade. We are in a race to repair and regenerate the planet. Some will focus on policy, some will focus on activism. We are focused on supporting the game changes, the innovators, the entrepreneurs and the problem solvers. We believe in the power of human ingenuity, grit and determination to create solutions that if scaled could repair the planet. We have only 8% of the ocean protected today, and our Earthshot is, as Pari said, 30 by 30, 30% of the ocean at least, 30% of the ocean protected by 2030. And we know that if we protect the right 30%, not only will we prevent the extinction of many marine species, but also we will produce more fish. There's going to be these protected areas are going to produce a spillover that will exceed the foregone catch. So we're going to have more fish to eat, food security, livelihoods for people. And we know that for every dollar that we invest in a protected area in a marine reserve, that produces 10 dollars in economic output and creates more jobs. So it's a triple win for marine life, for food security, and for climate, and of course for the economy. So that's the goal, the mission, to in the next 8 years, and that's where the Earthshot is pretty crazy. In the next 8 years, we need to quadruple all the ocean protection that has ever happened in human history. Are you optimistic that I can be done? I am optimistic there's no choice. I've seen firsthand the potential that a breakthrough idea can hold. And if we start seeing more of these transformative solutions across all the challenges facing our planet and suddenly our Earthshot won't seem so improbable, the work will be difficult. It'll take extraordinary resources, determination, partnership. But we've got all the essentials right here in this room. So what is the challenge? It's the speed, scale, and cost of making these green hydrogen generators. Well, that's exactly what we are working on. Because to make green hydrogen the fuel source of the future, it needs to be cheaper than fossil fuels. And that means, electrolyzers are going to need to be really, really cheap. If you want to take a solution around the globe as quickly as possible, you need to make it standardized, mass-produced commodity. The product that is easy to make and quick to build and cheap as well. And so, while some believe electrolyzers need to be large machines, we believe the electrolyzer should be a standardized mass-producible product that can make green hydrogen anywhere for anyone. In 2030, we imagine millions and millions of projects on restore and not just places on Earth where we see nature being brought back, but all of the other nodes that are key to ensuring success. So the technology providers, the nurseries, the seed banks, the funders, the government incentive programs, so that we have an ecosystem that really allows us to leverage the many, many connections within the nature-based solution space. And in 2030, we have been focused on another key area, which is cities. And cities require data and insights to take action on climate and to preserve nature, to create more nature and tree canopy. So we've set a goal that we want to- We have more nature in cities, exactly. Exactly, right. And so we've been partnering with cities like Los Angeles to give them insights utilizing AI and geo-mapping on where all the places that you can create more tree canopy, which reduces urban heat islands, improves air quality sequesters carbon. So we want to bring data and solutions to bringing nature into cities, as well as, of course, preserving and restoring nature. And so one of the goals that we've set is we want to enable over 500s.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1178,2022-11-20 11:56:16
18565," Data and solutions to bringing nature into cities as well as of course preserving and restoring nature. And so one of the goals that we've set is we want to enable over 500 cities around the world. I know we're going to hear from the mayor of Paris after this to reduce a gigaton of carbon emissions by 2030. And so that's through data, tools, insights, whether that's evolving transportation systems or planting new tree canopy. So that's a big bold target that we want to see achieved by 2030. Anyway, I guess I'm in the wrong place. I came here to invite all of you to the Grouch Convention. But it turns out you're all about my least favorite thing. Helping. Oh. You've got me, Oscar. I do like helping people learn how to reuse repurpose and recycle. Together, everyone in this room can build a world where nothing goes to waste. And that includes even you. Me. Sorry, Mike. I got to get going to that convention, but just between us. Yes. I do have a recycling bin right next to my can. But no, let that get out, OK? It'll ruin my image. But my father believed in the power of the idea. And over time, the vision, the purpose, the courage, it embodied, has inspired each generation to take on its own challenges, not because they're easy, but because they're hard. President Kennedy understood that the effort to land on the moon would bring out the best in us that everyone would have to contribute, that it would require innovation, creativity, teamwork, commitment, and faith. And that world would be better because of it. The Earth Shot Prize has inspired the same spirit of optimism and ingenuity on a global scale to tackle the most pressing challenge we now face, repairing the planet. My family and I are so excited that the Prince of Wales will honor this year's Earth Shot Prize winners in partnership with the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston, a city that is committed to scientific excellence, environmental justice, and the fight against climate change. We're proud that President Kennedy's moonshot legacy still inspires hope, and we look forward to welcoming all of you who are working to ensure a better future here on Earth. And that's all from the Earth Shot Prize Innovation Summit. You can find complete coverage of the event, including full interviews and articles on blooper.com. I'm Frossine Lackwap from New York, and this is Bloomberg. So what happens is that we create some icons, we call them tags, and they have a signal within them. And when you stare at that, your eye responds to it in a particular way. The way in which that eye response occurs is a signal that we pick up on the visual cortex of the brain, at the back of the brain. So the sensor is looking for the signals we create here that come through the eyeball, through the brain, and then onto the visual cortex. Once we've got it there as a signal, we can grab that, we understand what that signal looks like, and we can turn that into a command, whatever we're trying to control. There's multiple places where we think this technology can be applied, perhaps in driving or commanding, and ground vehicles or a man's naval vessels, perhaps providing a menu selection and control within a control room environment, maybe in a nuclear power station. All those kinds of things are perhaps in the failure rate of this technology. Access the financial world on demand.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1179,2022-11-20 12:00:31

You could trade anything as a trendfall. When you think about Bitcoin, I don't think it's a currency. I think it's a commodity. Today, we're in and everything about it. Genial and unflapable, even in the heat of a corporate crisis. That's a reputation of CS Venkata Krishnan. Known as Venkat, amongst colleagues, a former Barclays markets chief took over as chief executive after just Staley's abrupt exit in November last year. In his first TV interview since getting the top job, we talk about the bank's so-called universal model of retail, corporate, and investment banking. So what are the challenges that lie ahead and where does he see opportunities? Will Barclays have to increase provisions for low losses as a cost of living crisis gets worse? Over the next 30 minutes, we talk strategy, investment banking in Europe, the future of the city of London, and how inflation will change the banking world, with the man who's in charge of Barclays for the lost 12 months. Venkat, thank you so much for speaking to Bloomberg. So 12 months into the job. What have you learnt about yourself and the bank? The last 12 months have been a wonderfully educational experience. About myself, I've learnt how much more I needed to learn about banking, including running a large organisation, finding ways to encapsulate what our ambitions are, and to convey and get to so many people, and then visiting all the spewable footprint of the bank we have. It's also been a wonderful year in terms of the bank's operational performance. We've managed a bunch of crises, and we've managed them relatively well, I think. But it's the start. We are in a middle of a tough economic environment. So in terms of strategy, the strategy hasn't changed that much from your predecessor. Is it about execution, or is it a different lens that you're looking at it with? So I was part of the team that set up the strategy seven years ago. And our strategy then was to simplify our footprint, focus on building a global investment bank that was very highly competitive. We are now number six, we are the biggest European investment bank. It was about doubling down in the UK where we want to be a leading financial institution in sort of everything, retail and wholesale. And it is about building up a very specialised consumer business in the US, which we've done. We like the footprint, the businesses are operating well. I think now it is this driving to excellence, which is to make sure that in all the businesses which we do, clients and customers know what we are about, we do the things that we do very well. We don't have hobbies, we are very focused, we execute well. And it's about excellence. But can you really compete with the US bank in terms of having an investment bank? Can Europe have that leverage, or are you always going to be one step below? So we are competing. We are number six. We've been gaining market share and share revenue share in our markets business for many years. And we are under no illusion that we are not going to catapult, no do we want to catapult the number three or number two. But we can be very good at what we do.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1180,2022-11-20 12:04:52
18567," You know, we are under no illusion that we're not going to catapult, no do we want to catapult a number three or number two, but we can be very good at what we do. And if we are good, people will transact with us and work with us. And you can make a very good living at the size we are. Do you want to get bigger? Is now, if you look at the pipelines and things that are coming through, is now the right time to employ more bankers? Two slightly different questions about getting bigger. One is I think that as long as we do well and organically we grow, that's fine. I wouldn't want to take large steps, but if it happens in an accumulation over a period of time, that's welcome because it's gradual. About bankers, I think it's a question more about what sectors of banking? We've made a big push in sustainability and we continue to expect to do that. And obviously pulling out of some old economy sectors, reducing it not to zero, but there is a shift in the banking wallet and we respond to that. And I think sustainability is very important. Are you expecting more IPOs, more pipelines? You mentioned the environment that's a little bit uncertain at the moment. What does the next 12 months look like? I think it is going to be a difficult environment for the first six to nine months of that 12. I hope by the summer when people are able to sort of see the end of the rate rising cycle, it may not have happened by the summer, but hopefully you can forecast the end of it with reasonable confidence, then businesses will feel more confident themselves in what they want to do about their capital raising and capital planning. But I think it'll be a little time before we see that clarity. What's your biggest concern out there on the markets? Well, I think you had some good results. A lot of it has to do with also how you traded. Your traders perform very well, but we have a very uncertain environment. We don't know what inflation looks like, the cost of living. You have exposure to mortgage. There's leverage out there. What keeps you up at night? Well, I think what we've had this year is a series of incidents which would have been difficult to forecast at the start of the year. Even at the start of the year, I think across the industry, people were cautious that in you, we were at the start of a rate rising cycle. It's never good for credit assets in those periods. It's not good for equity assets generally in that period. Then you had the Russia Ukraine war. And then here in the UK, you had that little volatility with GILTS and LDI. So there are pockets where there could be leverage and there are pockets where they may be rapid movements. And in this kind of a rate rising cycle, you would expect to see that happen. So it's rather than being specific worries about certain things, it's being generally aware that you're driving a car when it's rainy and the roads may be slippery. So what does that mean in terms of risk management? What does that mean in terms of you preempting some of the things that could go on? We have been operating through the year with relatively less risk. And what I would call relatively less long biased risk, meaning expectations of asset prices to rise. Then we would normally have done or had done a year or two ago. So in the language of traders, we manage from a defensive position. Which means that things could still go wrong in unexpected ways or that you feel confident that you have this. You live through the financial crisis. And every two weeks somebody says, this is going to be worse than a financial crisis. This is worse than 70s. What kind of crisis are we going to see and what does it mean for the banks? First of all, I don't think as far as the banking system goes, this will be worse than the financial crisis. I think banks are much better capitalized but much better risk managed. And much more aware of the importance of doing that than they were back then. And the regulators are also much more intimately involved and engaged with the banks in understanding bank exposures. So I think it's not going to be like that. I think from our point of view and speaking for Barclays, what we have to worry about is the impact on consumers. We are starting at a point where people have strong balance sheets and employment is very high. So these are very good initial conditions. But squeezes are coming in different ways. In the UK, to a greater degree than the US, you've got the energy price squeeze. And also in the UK.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1181,2022-11-20 12:09:17
18568," conditions, but squeezes are coming in different ways. In the UK, to a greater degree than the US, you've got the energy price squeeze. And also in the UK, to a greater degree than in the US, you've got a squeeze coming from higher interest rates and mortgage prices and rents. Because it's more of a variable rate market. It's a more of a fixed market than it used to be, but it's more variable than the US is, which has a 15 or 30 of fixed market. But you're not seeing that, right? And consumer spending right now, you're not seeing it in in mortgages either, is a worry that we're complacent. And then at some points, next year, early next year, it hits us hard. Not that we are complacent, but even though we've started off in a good condition, there are factors that are eroding that strength of the consumer balance sheet. What I'm hoping you see is what people will call a soft landing and a shallow recession, helped by the initial conditions. And so what you might see is an increase in unemployment. You might see some credit weakness among customers, but it won't be so bad that you see distress in society. However, it has to be managed carefully, and it has to be managed aggressively with a balancing of the budget. And that's what the Prime Minister has said in the last couple of days. A lot of the satellites have propulsion systems. They can kind of move to get out of the way of each other or change their orbit a little bit. It's a service that you guys offer to help these companies know how to maneuver their machines. Yeah, we offer a collision avoidance service. It's a subscription service. We'll send you an alert up to seven days in advance if your satellite's going to come dangerously close to a piece of debris or another satellite. Companies have been doing that for decades moving satellites around, but it's sort of like a harder problem now. The risk of a collision is a lot higher now. Just because we've installed so much more hardware into space. You have a big collision that creates a cloud of debris, and now all the other satellites are flying through this whizzing mess of debris. As we add all of the new satellites into space, the risks of the collision, the likelihood of the collisions going up. Lots happening on Wall Street. I'm quite in curve. The center is holding. Need to catch up. This is Bloomberg Wall Street week. I'm David Western. We've got the information and insight. A lot of these areas still have very, very good valuations from businesses most influential and instrumental. It's knocking it out the bolt. Well, it's not a great time to be spectacular. It's time for a pivot. We're talking about a significant hit to our standard of living. Bloomberg Wall Street week. Live tonight with replays all weekend on Bloomberg television and radio. Talk to me a little bit about the last six weeks. So you mentioned the guilt. Was there a moment where you were in the office thinking like I, you know, as Barclays, you're one of, of course, the players in selling in buying guilds with the margin calls coming in and saying like, I don't know what happens in the next two hours. So, first of all, I think that, I think the the volatility was managed extremely well by the very effective, targeted and time-bound actions of the Bank of England. So I think buying guilds, buying inflation linked guilds, and then the repo facility that they put in working with the banking system all helped ease the pressure in the crisis. And, you know, you've got 10 year guild heels now back below where they were at the day of the mini budget on the 23rd of September. As for us, I mean, we are large in the guilds market. What was important for us, as we saw it, was this was not a solvency issue at all for the pension system. It was a liquidity issue. And it was a liquidity issue because what was a very important feature of the UK pension system, which by the way, I think is a good feature of the pension system, which is a matching of assets and liabilities, which employed leverage, created a liquidity problem. So a liquidity problem had to be managed. And the liquidity problem was managed by the government intervention or the Bank of England intervention, the repo facility, which allows people to borrow against assets rather than sell them, and by slowly releasing the pressure. And, you know, so far so good. Do you think that will change actually, regulations surrounding pensions in the UK?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1182,2022-11-20 12:13:38
18569," Staff, that's rather than sell them and buy slowly releasing the pressure. And you know, so far so good. Do you think that will change actually, where you're liations around you pensions in the UK? So, I don't know the answer, but I think what is important is that the UK pension system in aggregate is very well funded. It's about a hundred and twenty five hundred and thirty percent funded ratio, which is extraordinarily good, which gives it a good starting point from which to manage to a less leveraged future. It is liquidity, the biggest concern for banks right now. I mean, we're again hearing the US Treasury Secretary having to do things, maybe to put a bit of extra liquidity or to pad it out in the Treasury market. Bank liquidity, I don't think, is an issue. We've had liquidity regimes, you know, funding models are much, much more robust than they were in the financial crisis. I think part of what people are worried about and what they saw in the guilt market was the liquidity in underlying trading, which is that these markets are not deep with smaller bid-offers in large sizes of trades as they used to be fifteen years ago. And I think part of it, our banks are more prudent in managing their risk. So, that's a good thing. It's a good thing, but it has a consequence that the big providers of liquidity have moved away from the banking system to the buy side. Do you worry about shadow banking? And is there any crossover? Does that, if you look at the system as a whole, if there's something wrong with shadow banking, does it impact the big banks? So, it impacts the big banks, and by shadow banking, let's, I'll narrow it. I'll narrow it to, let's call FinTech companies. Right. So, it impacts the banks in a good way and a bad way. So, in a good way, what they've done is they've provided digital technology ways of giving services to customers, which customers like. And it's made us up our game. Right. And faster than we would have otherwise. And shame on us for not having done it earlier. Now, when they go into credit, which some of them have done, they have less regulation than we do, which is perhaps not good for customers who deal with them, who may not get the protections they do if they deal with us. And perhaps not good for them if they don't lend with quite the rigor and standards that more established companies might. On the second issue, that's a supposition. Let's see. What's your relationship like with the new UK government? Have you had calls? Have you, have they given you assurance about windfall taxes? Well, I think the government is brand new. So we obviously, many of the faces are very familiar faces, and we've been dead, you know, in communication with them in many, for many years. And we always are with the government. And you know, we are waiting to see their proposals on taxation, on fiscal policy, on all aspects of it. Where do you see the city of London being in four or five years? I mean, that's maybe too long a time frame. Should I say 12 months? Well, it's both too long and too short. You know, here we are in the city. And this city has been the center of finance for 300 years. And it needs to be the center of finance for 300 more years. We certainly would wish that that were the case. And it is the center of finance because of an excellent regulatory system, transparent, fair. It is there because of great availability of talent and infrastructure, soft financial infrastructure and hard financial infrastructure. And a part of that is also a stable, predictable taxation regime. So we hope that all those elements and ingredients remain and continue to allow the city to flourish. And you know, the Prime Minister spoke about investing in education in Britain. And if you think about what drives the financial sector, I mean, you meet many of them. It's about the wonderfully trained people in the UK and the wonderfully trained people outside for able to come and work in the UK. The UK has lost something. The city of London has lost business to other parts of the world in terms of, you know, financial capitals. Yes. What do you need from the government today for that to be reversed? Well, some of it is what others do, right? So once Brexit happened and you could not pass port financial services to London, all the major banks had to set up trading enterprises in Europe. So that is irreversible, let's say, for the time being.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1183,2022-11-20 12:17:58
18570," You could not pass port financial services to London. All the major banks had to set up trading enterprises in Europe. So that is irreversible, let's say, for the time being. I think other than that, what we need is a continuation of what London has provided. Education, infrastructure, people, great regulatory regime, and a stable and predictable fiscal regime. I think until not too long ago, Barclays had an activist shareholder on its back. Do you think about that? You always have to think about it. I don't think about it from the point of view of our business mix. I do think we have a good business mix. And that activist shareholder came because he thought we should sell our investment bank. He could not have been more wrong. I repeat it, he could not have been more wrong. The investment bank has been what has kept Barclays flourishing and quite apart from many of our competitors. In the fact that we performed extremely well during COVID, we are able to have a more diversified business model. But I think for many banks like us where our valuations are low, you've always got to be worried about what is driving bank valuations. Companies now, they're getting hundreds, maybe even thousands of applications. So software has come in to automate the process. You want to write your resume for robots, not for humans. The only job your resume has is to be comprehensible to the software that is reading it. Because that software or robot is going to decide whether or not a human ever gets their eyes on it. These things are programmed by a certain segment of the population that might not be totally inclusive or not be fully aware. Concerns about how this technology could exacerbate discrimination. For the FTC, I think foremost, the FTC needs to be making sure that we're fully understanding this technology. We don't trust companies to self-regulate when it comes to pollution. We don't trust them to self-regulate when it comes to workplace comp. Why on earth would we trust them to self-regulate AI? Is Europe overbanks? Europe is against separate Europe from the UK. I don't think the UK is overbanks. I think part of what drives bank valuations, especially in Europe versus the US, is there is some worry about business model. In our case, we've got the right business model and what will drive our valuation is solid performance. Excellent performance. I think in Europe, banking is still fairly nationalized, not nationalized in state-owned, but by country. We have to see at some point the experiment of one large European bank crossing borders in a meaningful way. Do you think that will happen? Or is it just a dream? We've been talking about it. I feel like for two decades. It's a question more for the European bank CEOs. I think it should happen. I think the test case should happen. Now is a good time. When you go through a period like this, there will be some banks which will benefit from consolidation and ownership by a larger entity. I hope I see it happen and it will be good for Europe. Your bank is doing pretty well. Others are doing less well. We talk about Credit Suisse almost day in day out. Have you been able to get some business from clients that no longer want to bank with them? Well, business goes or every way.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1184,2022-11-20 12:22:09
18571," Business from clients that no longer want to bank with them? Well, you know, business goes or every way in the banking industry. Obviously, where credit suites has pulled out of certain businesses, such as the prime business, we got some business from their clients. But look, they announced a big restructure and we wish them well. It is important for the banking system for there to be many players who are strong. And I think, you know, with this restructuring, hopefully credit suites is on a good upward trend and regains the prominence it used to have. Venkett, talk to me about some of the human errors, right? The recession that we've been talking about and how much that cost you. I know that there was also, I don't know if it's punishments coming or some, you know, steps towards the people that did those mistakes. Where are we on that? So we had an over-issurance of securities in the US. It was completely avoidable. It is one of these embarrassing moments you hate to have when you're CEO of a bank. It is, however, it was a human error in a very narrow way. We have done both and had an external investigation on it and internal investigation. We have made good by all the clients affected. We have had a settlement with the SEC. We cooperated from the first minute fully with all our regulators and we dealt with the matter internally. We are in the final stages now where individuals who were affected or involved in this are being assessed. We've got a standard process by which we do that and yes, there will be implications for certain individuals but that process will play itself. Venkett, I mean, through your strategy, we talked a little bit about the global economy. Do you worry that this wave of inflation is just going to get worse? When will we reach peak inflation? When will we know? We will know that the rate of change of inflation is stabilizing. When the central banks start signalling it that in their rate rises. Going away from 75 basis points, 100 basis points, to something more normal and actual. Now, mathematically, there will be some forces that will bring inflation down, you know, just because base effects as they call them. And I expect that will happen sometime in the middle of next year. Is there danger that central banks messes up, that they raise interest rates too much? Look, there's always a finely calibrated issue about when do you stop? And I think many people have sort of raised two worries. One is that there's a sort of supply chain led element of this. There's an energy shock element of this. Employment is at all time highs, relatively speaking, and that people have not seen such a hiking cycle in, you know, three decades. Having said that, I think the officials are all across the world are all very, very experienced. And I think they'll find the right way to calibrate it. How difficult is it in this uncertain environment, frankly, to, you know, calibrate where you want to grow businesses geographically in the world? Well, I'll speak for Barclays. You we've got, you know, a real strength of the business in the US and the UK. We've got a good investment bank in Europe and a trading business. We had caught it in Ireland, but got a large trading presence in France. And then good presence in Asia, both in the Middle East and India. We've got an excellent investment banking franchise and Singapore and Hong Kong. I expect that footprint to remain broadly as it is. We have some very interesting partnerships in Australia. We might do some others. But I expect the broad footprint to be as it is. You know, the geopolitical complexities, which are also rising, makes people more cautious also about which countries they want to go to. Have you had to increase wages? And I'm not really thinking of the high-flyer bankers, but just to, you know, to match inflation in most of these places. Yeah, so we did a fairly large program of wage rises in India where we've got a large number of employees last year in 2021. In the UK, we did an interim adjustment in August of about 4% for a lot of hours.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1185,2022-11-20 12:26:36
18572," large number of employees last year in 2021. In the UK, we did an interim adjustment in August of about 4% for a lot of our workers. And then we are working through another one for the end of this year. And we did one in the US also late last year. So I think inflation, especially as it affects some of our workers, we're going to have to look at it and we're going to have to respond. When you look at the return to the office, I think you, Bankers, have to be back. Four days a week. How's that going? It's going well. Look, I think we always have to create a balance. There's a level of flexibility that's come into work life into the workplace since COVID, which I think is good. I think some of the stigma attached to working from home has gone away. And I think that's really important, especially for those who are managing young families or have other pressures that require them to spend more time at home or close to home. And I think we should continue that and should continue that in important ways. Some jobs require you to be in the office. Our trading flows are largely full five days a week. And that's the way it should be. Our bank branches here in London also need to be stuffed and they should be. And for some other functions, it can be less. But I do think it's important for people in all functions at all levels to be in the office. This isn't a apprenticeship business at the end of the day. And it's important to have that productivity from being face to face. When you look at the strength and dollar, I mean, this could be a shorter term. It could last for a very long time if you'll get King Dollar. What does it mean for Berkley's? Well, as a financial matter, it's actually good. We have about 40% of our revenues in dollars. We've got a fairly big business in the US. More broadly, though, I mean, world economies will have to adjust. And that adjustment process can be painful. And you can see the pain it's inflicting in Europe and the UK. Export will be subsidized, but in poor prices go up. Vanca, thank you so much. Francine, thank you very much for having me. MUSIC Tag on the product may read made in the USA, but the sign on the CEO's door often says made in India. Alphabet Sundart Pachai, Microsoft Sacha Nadella, IBM's Arvind Krishna, Micron Technologies Sanjay Mayhotra, and that's just the start. Add in the chief executives of Adobe, Deloitte, Gap, VMware. And that doesn't count Indians running companies all over the world. Why have so many Indians risen to the top? For no coastal appoints to India's incredibly competitive education system, if you can survive the pressure it takes to get into one of the Indian Institutes of Technology, it gives you confidence to handle American universities and later the business world. Meanwhile, the belief in India's ability to produce so many tech wizards is reinforced every year. Indians make up about three-fourths of the immigrants receiving coveted H1B visas for the US. And it's a safe bet that some of them will eventually find their way to the C-suite. Thank you. Hey, one covers the world like Bloomberg.

With unmatched reach in resources from more than 120 countries, the moment news breaks 24 hours a day. Bloomberg, your global business authority.

We work for learning, for communicating, for staying in touch. It was meaningful. Thank you so much for joining us. Thank you for having me. What drives you? What drives me? Oh my God, I love the idea of just... I mean, as simple as this uninclusive world, a world where people see themselves reflected. Because I was supposed to be invisible by your accounts. I was supposed to not be where I am. I was supposed to have disappeared a long time ago. And every turn in my life was about visibility. Yes, I will be this person who's not supposed to be here. Yes, I will fight through the hard times. Yes, I won't give up. And even though I was sort of the token black editor in the industry in the 90s, I knew even then that I needed to bring people up with me. I needed to bring other people up with me. And so that's really been a part of... Maybe it's growing up in a family of six, I don't know. When you run a team, how do you instill that work ethic that kind of answering emails at all time? I mean, you know, I think you see an example. If you're an editor who leaves and has lunches and is never in the office, you don't really sort of instill faith. My team know that we're on a mission. We have to reflect the world we live in. We have to reflect the beauty of multiculturalism. We have to reflect the beauty and diversity and inclusivity. So everybody takes it really seriously and we really have intense conversations about the side guys and the world. And so I'm very lucky to have a team who are passionate. And I can call my team, I can call somebody at 6 a.m. or they can call me at 6 a.m. and they'll pick up. So we have something very special that we've built over the past five years. But there were difficult moments, right? I think the first time one of your first issues you thought that you could have been fired for it. Is that right? I mean, I lived in America for a bit and I was working for W Magazine and there was talk of Brexit and of course Americans were like your country's really, you know, xenophobic. So, you know, I came back and I thought, you know, I'm going to be welcome with open arms and they're going to love me and oh my god, literally back to them by fire. But I remember thinking, you know, I wanted to create a magazine where every woman could see themselves. You know, where every woman regardless of the backgrounds, regardless of their age could just literally see themselves. And at the time, now it looks like it's the norm when you look at other magazines. But in 2017, that was that was a radical idea. But I also remember thinking, you know, with my background, you know, I've lost so much and gained so much that I thought, if I knew, if I'm fired, I'd rather be fired for what I believed in. I'd rather be fired for creating a magazine that reflected the world as it was than try to sort of create a second-rate version of someone's vision. And that continues. I mean, there's this idea of always pushing forward. Yeah. Right? What's the end? How do you measure success? How do I measure success? I'm definitely not not the final.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1187,2022-11-20 12:35:23
18574," This idea of always pushing forward. Yeah. Right? What's the end? How do you measure success? I have a measure success. I'm definitely not financial. I mean, I think it's more about, for me, when I'm really exhausted, when I'm really tired, when I'm really questioning if I can go on, you know, I walk on the street and I see a little girl, a little black girl who's seeing the magazine, and it's the norm for them all. A curvy woman on a traitor palace who's like, thank you for, you know, seeing me, you know, that makes it worth what, that for me is success. And anybody who knows or has known me for a while will witness that for me is success. You know, my jaw is done when that happens. Do you think, I mean, do people come up to you? They do, but it's always in a positive way. It's always thank you for seeing us, you know. But I can relate, because, like I said to you, you know, by all accounts, I was meant to be invisible, you know? So for me, shining in light on people and making them see, it's natural for me. They say that the fashion industry is changing. You're changing it. Are others around you changing it? I mean, now, you know, you look at other magazines and seeing real women in there, it's no longer a radical act. See, you know, people of color, women of color on covers is no longer a radical act. So it's been normalized, you know, it's been normalized. And for me, I'm quite happy when I see that. You know, when you put Dame Judy Dengue on the cover, and she's 85 years old, and the world just laughed at it. Nobody questioned her, you know, should she be on the cover or you put, you know, a girl with a hijab on the cover. And it's not a problem. That for me shows that, you know, we're advancing. We're progressing. So, you know, progress for me is very important. Which is important. And so how do you take care of your team? How do you build a team around you? My team, I mean, some, you know, somebody said to me once, when you build a team, make sure you employ people you like. People, when you see them working towards your office, you're just so excited to see. That was it. Being good at your job and sort of a connection. And being excited to see, you know, team members, because you only have to do this to your team, you know. No man is an island, you know, I don't create the magazine on my own. And so it's great to have a team who you respect and who's views you respect, you know, and who respect yours. How do you think you're seen by your team? Do you have to be fearful? Do you have to be also terrible? I mean, you know, I'm a worker. I work very hard. But I think I'm pretty open. You can have conversations with me, you know, ultimately the final decision rests with me. But I do listen. I like conversation. I like interaction. And so that's, I mean, that's how I hope they think I'm a good boss. And that's, you know, really all you can hope for. Because, you know, they work on a very good magazine. They can get other jobs anywhere. So the fact that they have made me think that they must be happy. Edward, how do you see the publishing world changing? So people buy less magazines. You've been, I mean, you've been doing pretty well in terms of selling more. But in five years, how does it look? How does it look? I mean, I was like, you know, five years ago, I, you know, even, I mean, let's go back to ID when I was 18, you know, I inherited a magazine, you know, which would come out. We're all about club kids. And you had to be out there. And the only way you could see street fashion was through ID. And then 2017, I inherited, you know, I inherited a magazine. But now I oversee a brand. You know, the magazine is still there. The magazine is sort of the highest, sort of the high, the best paper, you know, the best photographer, the best, you know, cultural messages. But at the moment, you know, when you manage a brand, it's not just about that. It's about digital. It's about video. It's about audio. It's about events. So for somebody who's so forward looking, it's so great for me. And people always ask, oh, it's, our magazine's dead. When we launch a cover, Instagram is our cover, essentially. So I've, you know, found a way, we found a way of sort of making it work, hand in hand. And it's so great for me, you know, I think, how do I just been doing the magazine? I probably would have been bored. So magazines aren't dead? Are they gonna... No, I mean, you know, I mean, yeah, I'm a little working hand with a digital platform.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1188,2022-11-20 12:39:52
18575," I think how do I just been doing the magazine I probably would have been bored? So magazines aren't dead? Well they're going to work in hand with digital platforms. But also I'll tell you something, new readers of old, young readers don't necessarily come to us through the news stands. They come through that did you sell platforms or audio or videos we put out. So yes, now it's increased tenfold. So yeah. Do you think that will change the kind of readership that you will court, the either age of your readers but also where they come from? Yes, I mean at the moment, I think the readership is getting younger because of the whole digital landscape. And I hope that as we move forward it kind of brings we have new readers and we also keep our loyal readers. Do you think there's ever a time where actually we won't have print magazines anymore? No, I think print will always exist sort of a long-side digital but it'll probably be something more precious, sort of better paper, something more collectible that you want to keep in your house, almost like artwork. So no, I don't think print is going to die. So fewer copies. But more quality. You know, almost like a book. The table book. I'd love that. Fine, no. While Tesla's in the like make for good headlines, the reality is that even if every car on the roads today won electric, it wouldn't be enough to curb global emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions from transportation account for about 29% of total US greenhouse gas emissions. So what about the other 71%? Building to cross America burned fossil fuels to operate. What we want to do is make that all electric. Instead of burning oil and gas to give us the energy and electricity we need, we want to do 100% clean energy, all electric. We want to turn buildings into Tesla's. Just like a Tesla or an electric vehicle is all electric with no fossil fuels. We want to do that with our buildings. And if we can do it in one building, we can do it in all buildings. And if we can do it in one building, we can do it in one building. And if we can do it in one building, we can do it in one building. And if we can do it in one building, we can do it in one building.

We did see pressure on the U.A. and we did see pressure on the future. That is now being reversed. You're recently on TikTok. Yes. Is that fun? It's not so much fun. I literally have to be held back. But the brilliant thing is, I'm so curious. I mean, I like all the digital platforms. I really like to keep my finger on the pulse. I'm not one of those people that leaves work and just shuts themselves in. I really want to be out there seeing the world as today. It's in all its beauty. So I'm very curious. I have a very curious mind. And I'm glad. I'm glad, you know, it keeps everything moving and exciting. So is that for Gen Z? Is that a commercial purpose to get closer to the world? No, it's just out of curiosity. I've always been like that. I've always wanted to know what's next. I didn't want to be the one that's just being told, oh, you're 50 or whatever. I pay attention to everything. But the world is such a beautiful place for me. You know, and it goes back to my childhood again. Well...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1189,2022-11-20 12:44:01
18576," I pay attention to everything, but there was such a beautiful place for me. And it goes back to my childhood again. Well, it will be your biggest challenge to grow the brand in the next five years. We still keep it relevant. We have such great digital traffic, almost almost six million every month to British vote. But I'm really sort of excited about overseeing the European votes as well, Spain, Italy, Germany and France, and sort of mentoring a whole new generation of editors. When there was this whole agonization, the whole world thought there was a global view that was going to dominate. But it's very much about local conversations as well as global conversations. So I learn from these content leads, and I hope that they also learn. So the local, global conversation I'm very excited about moving into the future. Do you think it changes if we're in a recessionary environment? So you have such a glamorous lifestyle, or what you sell is so glamorous. Is it impacted by the cost of living or inflation of what we can live through? I mean, you know, I remember a few years ago I put Taylor Swift on the cover, and the by-line was by better, by less. And it was a radical concept at the time. But now we all talk about sustainability. We know we can't keep shopping every day. We know we have to buy things that last, things that help the planet, things that we can pass on to sort of other generations. I think that really is a conversation on the fashion industry is having right now that I find so exciting. And it's going to be sort of, you know, people are going to have less money so they have to buy things that last. And I'm really excited. And these are real changes. It's not just real changes. Real changes. It's not just conversation. It's actually happening. Do you think fashion brands always need to have a political point of view when they're great injustices? I think fashion brands can do more. I feel that having a black model in your show or having, you know, a feed on your Instagram post, it's not enough. We need diverse voices behind the scenes. I always say that I talk to sort of all the CEOs I know we need to employ more people from, you know, from, you know, diverse backgrounds. Because that's the only way you can even reach out to more people, you know, a variety of voices always better than just, just one. And I always also say, you know, let's not just have interns, let's have people on all different levels. And that's what I keep talking to people about. Do they listen? Some listen. But I think since, you know, George Floyd was murdered more and more companies sort of made pledges to people of color. And, you know, it's a slow, it's a slow process. Some have taken it seriously and some are still working their way through it. But, you know, we have to keep on. The problem is that you can make a pledge and then follow through. Right? You know, so you have to really sort of focus and keep asking that question for people to follow through. And so do you feel like you're a guardian of, you also have that, of making sure that when you get promised something, they'll do it. And you'll hold them into account. Yes, if they promise something, you know, that I asked for, then I would literally wear you down. I would literally chase you until you keep your promise not just who I am. But we actually have one of the diverse, diverse cabinets here in the UK with Liz Truss. Is that important to you? It is so important as somebody who came from another country and was sort of welcomed by the UK. It's very important to have a diverse cabinet. That's how change happens. You know, going back to what we discussed before. That's how you understand people who are on the periphery or who've been avid. It's so important to have a diverse cabinet. But this you think in terms of policies and what they can bring to the table or just also seeing a new cabinet. I hope they can have an effect on policy. I hope they can have an effect on the parties themselves.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1190,2022-11-20 12:48:22

For me, it's about policy that makes people's lives better. I know you're also very close to Ghana still. I mean, there's a pretty scandalous anti-LGBT bill getting through. I mean, it's so funny. Back to Ghana a few years ago by the president, was the year of the return. And I remember the last time we were in Ghana, we were fleeing. And I really supported the changes. I love the changes that we're going through, but yes, they do have an LGBT problem. Some friends and I signed a whole, I don't know if you saw it. And we're doing what we can to change things on the ground. I think you come up to sit in the West and tell a country what to do. So it's about sort of forming alliances on the ground and seeing what is needed and how we can help, rather than standing on our soap boxes going, do this, do that, do this. So that's through what grounds, I mean, ground work, trying to change from with it. Yes, from with it. Trying to change from with it, you know, talking to heads of LGBTQ members and asking them what they need and what we can do to help. Rather than, you know, I'll say, do this. This is how you do it because we don't live there. You have a memoir out. Why put it down on paper? You know something about when you turn 50. Well, something about when it's your fifth year at Vogue. You know, I got married this year. I'm normally not someone who looks back all the time, but it felt like the right time for me to do that. And also, you know, I just felt that a lot of young people sort of see people like you and I and they think, you know, we just got here and we were always here and for me, it was really important to share the story of a journey about, you know, successors and, and, you know, failures and, you know, that's the reason why I got here. So I just wanted to share that story with them, sort of young people. That's what those people who, you know, feel like they're on the outskirts. You know, they're outside the industry, really. Do you feel like an outsider? I think I always feel like an outsider, but I just said before, you know, I grew up African in an African household in England, you know, different languages, different foods, and I now go to school and I've been in England. So I've always been about duality. I've always seen myself as an outsider, but also an insider. And even when, you know, I took the job at Britishville, I was the black gay working class outsider, but, you know, I've been in the industry since I was 18. I was, in essence, an insider. So that's really, it's the other duality that plays out in my life. What, who do you think made you the person you are today? I know you left home twice, right, Ghana, but also you had to leave your home. Yes. I mean, the person made me who I mean, really is my mother. I mean, I mean, I loved my mother. She taught me about sort of beauty. She taught me about clothes, about fascism. She also taught me that beauty came in all forms. That, you know, women were beautiful, no matter what shape they were, no matter what color, what religion. And so that really stayed with me. And I guess my creativity comes from her. And of course, I also had a military father. So the idea of precision and organization and sort of thinking ahead also comes from here. So the best of both worlds. How did your father, I know you had a difficult relation with your father. How did your father shape the person you are today? It's so funny, you should ask this question, because I never thought I was like my father growing up. You know, I was very shy, very sensitive, you know, a little, a little spacey. I prefer the company of women. To men, my dad was sort of, you know, a sort of authoritarian, disciplinarian. You know, you had to, you know, be home at a certain time. He roared with an iron fist. And I thought, you know, I'm never going to be like him. You know, he kicked me out of the house, you know, when I was 18. But I found out that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1191,2022-11-20 12:52:45

What was that like? Yes. Basically I have sort of very high myopia. So I've never had great eyesight and I went through a series of sort of repnal detachments for to be exact. And with each detachment, I'll sort of have to end up looking down in a contraption for about three weeks. And in the dark room, it was very harrowing, it's very harrowing time in my life. But I always say, you know, you don't have to have vision to have vision. So in those dark rooms, my imagination was even bigger. I dream bigger. And I came out to sort of the last surgery and the cover I did was for W Magazine with Rihanna as the queen, with a golden eye. And I look back at it at the end and I thought, oh my God, there are the eyes, some limit, some limitily. So yes, it was very challenging. And even to this day, you know, I go for checkups to make sure my eyes are okay. And they're great right now. And you know, the more I look after myself, the better. The better. Yeah. But it's amazing. You power through adversity. Do you ever think actually this is too much? Have you ever thought this is too much? I mean, there have been times when I felt this is too much, but it's not in my vocabulary to start. It's not in my DNA to start. You know, I am my mother's son, my father's son. You know, the edge to move forward is always there. And that's why, you know, when I was young, I would always get up and work. I had a responsibility touch when I still got on a plane to go shoot the Hollywood portfolio. But now I'm learning to say no. Now I'm learning I can't do that job. I can't fly. No, it takes time, but it comes with age. It takes courage to say no. Right? Definitely. So when you look at all your covers and there's so many beautiful ones, is there one that's that's special to you? Well, I say someone, they're like my children. I'm always having a different child. But I'm especially proud of the covers we did in lockdown. When the world had essentially shut down, you know, the teams were sort of scattered all around London. And I had to go back to the days of I did when, you know, you had to really create user imagination. And we had a series of four covers, Judy, Dange, when they said, you know, anybody over 60.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1192,2022-11-20 12:56:55
18579," I did when you had to really create user imagination. And we had a series of four covers, Judy Dunnich, when they said, anybody over 60, she stayed at home, the essential workers cover, a cover of landscapes, just so people could take a breather, and the activists cover when George Floyd was murdered. And I really think we create covers that in years time people can look back and see what the time, that period was like, for me an artist always has to reflect their times as Nina to paraphrase Nina Simone, and that's really important for me. I mean, there was a bit of controversy with Linda van Gelista. Yes. Yes, I mean, you know, there was a, there was a complaint that, oh, you know, she should, she should have looked a certain way, you know. And for me, I've not lived in the 90s. I've known this incredible icon, who really defined what a model should be. And I also saw my friend go through really dark days, you know, due to the complications with surgery, literally disappear from the world, really not the Linda the world news. So when we were doing this cover, it was the collaboration. She wanted to be that Linda, that everybody knew. She wanted to feel good about herself again, and I wasn't going to deny her that. And also, you know, whatever I would like to say, whatever a woman wants to do with her body, it's up to her. So, you know, I'm very proud of Linda and I'm very proud of that cover. And I mean, some that you're almost like an activist. Is that how you, you're like a fashion activist or a political fashion? I'm a makeup artist, so, but I'm definitely creative. But, you know, I've always believed, you know, look at my, my life story in my book, you know. I wasn't like, I keep saying I wasn't supposed to be here. You know, have my dad not left, I don't know even what would have happened to my family. So, even when we ended up in a room, two rooms in a voxel, six of them, we were so happy to be there, penniless, but so happy to be there. So, you know, every day, I just, you know, I'm an optimist and I know it's not the most fashionable thing, but that's why I'm sitting here with you today. Bye. Edward, thank you so much for your time today. Thank you. What do Formula One cars and your local supermarket have in common? Well, strange as it sounds, they might both be using the same technology. A lot of innovation has trickled down from the world of high tech engines and it hasn't just found a new life in road cars. F1 cars have long been thought of as the peak of cool and technology in them is also helping to pull down our produce aisles engineers from Williams are using their knowledge from nine constructors championships working with company Aerofoil to help reduce the energy consumption of supermarkets. The device they're building is based on the design of an F1 cars rear wing. It attaches to fridges to keep more cool air in the unit. They estimate it can reduce supermarket energy consumption by 25%. One innovation from F1 is also helping hybrids reduce their carbon footprint. That's curves or the kinetic energy recovery system. In common parlance, it's known as regenerative breaking and works by storing energy of the car decelerating in a battery for later use. If that's not enough, F1 is now looking at hers or a thermal energy recovery system looking to harness the heat produced from breaking and the engine exhaust. That could allow cars to generate the same power using 30% less fuel. So while F1 may have a reputation as a gas-duzzler, some of its innovations in the name of speed are helping in the everyday fight against climate change. So what's the best investment advice you've ever put in? Given by anybody. The compound interest, the compounding of returns is an incredible miracle of business, finance, and human existence. Everything you learn is additive every day. And if you keep at it and don't quit, it's an incredible miracle. And it's not just interest. It was always said above compound interest returns, compound business returns, compound human returns. They're all very additive because you'll learn every day.

Yes, or yes, not keeping, but people have conviction or they invest for the, if they invest for the right reasons, they just keep at it. I saw a shark tank trailer. Yeah, that's fine. That's fine.

And the four of us came together about six months ago to work on software for small business owners. That's the application video Tony Shoe and his door dash co-founders submitted to get a ticket into why combinators prestigious startup accelerator back in 2013. Fast forward nearly 10 years later and door dash has gone from a struggling food delivery story to a public company that's the US leader in delivery. But the big question facing companies now is how to navigate a potentially prolonged economic downturn joining me on this edition of Bloomberg Studio 1.0, door dash CEO and co-founder Tony Shoe. Tony, it's so great to see you. Great to see you too Emily. In person. I know. You went public in the pandemic. We were talking remotely. But there's nothing quite like an in-person interview. So thank you for being here. It's great to be here. You basically grew up in a restaurant as I understand it. What was it like leaving China moving to Illinois and starting this new life? It was a classic immigrant story. In many ways I would say looking back almost a fairy tale like Journey where you know my parents came to the US with $250 in the bank. We immigrated to Illinois, Champaign or Banna. My dad got his degree at the University of Illinois. My mom put food on the table by working three jobs today. One of which did happen to be in a Chinese restaurant where I moonlight it as a dishwasher. So I got to hang out with mom that way as a way of growing up. And I did that. I mowed lawns. And that's really kind of how I saved up money to you know by Nintendo games and do all the things that were the wonders of my childhood. What do you think you learned from that? You know mowing lawns early, washing dishes early. I think two things. You know one looking backwards it's just that you have to work to actually get things done. I didn't understand what it meant to live off of food stamps to buy groceries or free and reduced lunch you know every day inside school. But it was a very empowering feeling to buy my own Nintendo or earn my way to buy my first Apple computer. The second thing was really just the power of independent thinking. You know my parents because they were so busy just trying to make a life for our family that I was largely left alone. So I grew up playing basketball, watching TV. That's how I learned English. I grew up moving around a lot as a kid. And as a result I think that gave me a lot of time to realize that it's pretty important to think for yourself. So you studied engineering at Berkeley. You went to business school at Stanford. And you actually started out as an intern at Square. I did. I can't tell you how many people have said to me Tony Shoe was my intern. That's where. Like that's how long I've been doing this and how you know Dordash just kind of came out of nowhere. Yeah I you know it was it was actually a pretty stiff competition between finishing school. Jack Dorsey and Keith were trying to convince me to leave Stanford and work at Square full time. It was a fun and busy period of my time but I enjoyed both. So how did the idea for Dordash come about and the decision to not work for you know Jack Dorsey.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1194,2022-11-20 13:05:48

So how did the idea for DoorDash come about and the decision to not work for, you know, Jack Dorsey in Square, which I'm sure was also kind of intoxicating, right? The idea for DoorDash really came from this, you know, lifelong interest in helping these physical business owners, really people like my mom. So we talked to hundreds of small business owners and it was surprising to us that even in 2013, delivery was not a solved problem. There were business owners who would show us literally booklets of delivery orders that they would refuse. I mean, we were talking about thousands of dollars per week, which is, you know, the difference sometimes between making payroll and actually, you know, surviving, and they would just turn them down because they were delivery orders, which to us was a really novel and unfortunate phenomenon and, frankly, a necessary one. And that really became, you know, the impetus to start DoorDash. You started out driving for competitors, right? I was driving for a lot of different services to try to actually understand, you know, logistics. You know, my background, as you mentioned, more in engineering, math, I thought I was going to be a cancer researcher. I mean, that's pretty much what I spent all of my undergraduate days at Berkeley doing. That kind of 180ed into a world of business. But, and so I think it's really important to really learn things for yourself, you know, to think from first principles. Kind of, you know, again, back to that independent thinking, mindset I talked about as a child growing up. Did you try for Uber or Lyft? I even drove for, you know, services that were a little bit older. And services like FedEx or Domino's and really try to explore, you know, how does delivery work? And it was really trying to understand, you know, every component part. I mean, it sounds really simple, right? Bring you a burrito from point A to point B, but there were actually 20 steps involved in that delivery. It just didn't appear as obvious to the, you know, naked eye. So the first two years of DoorDash's life, we did deliveries almost every single day. So where did you go from there? I mean, I mean, it's early days I know Elon Musk has said, starting a company is like swallowing glass and staring into the abyss of death. One of the first ones came actually as early as month three of the company's life. So we were maybe 11 weeks, 12 weeks old as a company. There was a big Stanford football game in September. And, you know, long story short, we were late on every single order. And we had no ability to turn off the site. So it was just horrendous. Everyone in the company, all 12 of us were delivering. And everyone, you know, rightfully so, was furious because of how late we were. And so we had a decision to make, you know, do we do the right thing and refund, you know, every single customer, which would have cost us about 40% of our bank account? Or do we, you know, do a less right thing and survive another day? Because it was very hard for us at that time to raise capital, which, you know, was something true for DoorDash's early history. And, you know, it took us about 30 seconds to click, submit, refund. And, you know, the lesson for us always is a founding team. And frankly, even today as a company, as we'd rather die chasing excellence than live to be mediocre. It wasn't so obvious either in the earlier years. I remember in 2016, you did a down-round. I think you actually came on the show around that time. How did you weather the doubters and the, you know, the people who didn't believe? There were about a thousand days in the desert between 2016, 17, and 18. Sometimes with company building, so long as you can convince yourself, because time is your, you know, most precious resource, you should keep going. And if you can keep going long enough, you might get lucky enough to make it. So over time, how did you balance quality with the need and desire to scale? And then scale globally? In these types of businesses where it's low margin, high complexity, you really have to figure out what your unit of business is. You know, for us, that was a city. So in order to, before going to 7,000 or 10,000 cities globally, we made one city work. And after city one worked, we made city two work. And after we started getting higher and higher confidence that we can make baskets of cities work, irrespective of the geographies, or what, you know, the customer situation looked like, or what the merchant makeup was, then we gained the confidence to actually roll out everywhere. Then came the pandemic. Brian Chesky has said the pandemic was like a torpedo for Airbnb. Was it like the opposite for DoorDash? It was like the biggest wave behind her back, which had the ability to...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1195,2022-11-20 13:10:09
18582," was it like the opposite for DoorDash? you know, had the ability to break us We went from a singular US restaurant delivery business to a five businesses in 27 countries, you know, much more than just restaurants and so all of that was created in the last two years The big question is how much do customers keep ordering out in a high inflation environment? Okay, so you're moving in on me quick, just trying to me with your fancy hands I'm going to deal with your night because it's really bothering me My nights? Yeah, he's a troublemaker What did you get up to this weekend? You know, just robot stuff, a lot of chess I was practicing for you, I know you're pretty good I don't like that I will take this Put it over here Not cool, not cool Alright, I will, I will concede I can see you've got me, Bid Very good game, well played Thank you, sir, thank you No one covers the world like Bloomberg The writings on the wall for the bank of England Just stock oil has spray paints at the front door Session in Europe, UK and possibly the US We are out in full force celebrating the election victory of former president Blula With unmatched reach in resources from more than 120 countries, the moment news breaks 24 hours a day Bloomberg, your global business authority DoorDash went public, middle of the pandemic And I remember actually you were coming on Bloomberg and the price doubled at the opening Obviously, terrible economic times, the depths of the pandemic What did that feel like when you're going out into the world starting to sell to public investors And the price just doubles It was certainly very exciting, it was exhilarating It was the first time that our company went public The first time that I had ever undergone any of those types of experiences before But in the back of my head it was that saying that you're never as good or as bad as they say you are And so just remember that So tease that out for me a little bit because the big question is how much do customers keep ordering out in a high inflation environment How much long-term sustainability and growth is there really Even though COVID is now effectively sustained and we understand how to live with it Customers are continuing to order Those that join us during the pandemic they're still ordering out about the same rights as those who joined us before the pandemic And that's because eating out and getting things delivered are pretty complimentary On the second point around inflation, you know I can say that in the last 60 years in looking at the data Spend in restaurants and in grocery have only declined in two of those 60 years including high inflationary times Much higher than what we observed today And so what I think I take you know, solace in even though I see the fact that there is high inflation Is that customers are going to continue spending on food and our job is to bring greater and greater affordability More broadly the economy isn't a tough position Your competitors have announced layoffs and hiring freezes and slowdowns is door dash considering any of these I think we've been fortunate mostly because most of our investments that happened during the pandemic Really were meant to build new businesses And those new businesses have continued to grow new business is you know beyond restaurants And categories like grocery convenience or retail new businesses overseas you know we announced a large acquisition Involved where that really helped double our overall addressable market to 700 million people New businesses and building and advertising",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1196,2022-11-20 13:14:18
18583," This is overseas. We announced a large acquisition in Volt, where that really helped double our overall addressable market to 700 million people. New businesses in building an advertising business, new businesses expanding our services and building a platform to help businesses build their own digital operations. Do you see DoorDash as more of a super app of the future or is it something different? Well, I see DoorDash as really solving two problems. You know, problem one is how do we bring incremental demand to all the physical businesses as they kind of figure out their own digital inhouse capabilities. And the second problem we're trying to solve is bring tools to these businesses. There's still a lot of competition and delivery. Who do you think survives the delivery wars? Who doesn't and why? Well, delivery is a scale economy's game. You know, at the end of the day, you can survive even doing deliveries from a singular story. There's still mom and pop pizza shops and Chinese restaurants that do their own delivery. Do you see DoorDash as a challenger to like Walmart? Amazon. Well, I see DoorDash, you know, as a champion of local businesses and physical businesses. I don't think that a world in which we just get what we want to buy or consume for a few places is a world that, again, is as worth enjoying living in. It's our job is to make sure that all of these businesses, all of the millions of physical businesses globally, can continue to compete. I do a lot of DoorDash, helps me be a working mom. Whenever I interview you, I get pings from dashers and some of them say they don't get paid enough. Some of them seem pretty angry. What's your response to them? We want the local economy to grow and to thrive. That includes dashers. We have three million dashers that come to the platform every single quarter. And so it's really important to me what they say. And it's, in fact, why, you know, the company, myself included, we still dash due deliveries in other words once a month. You still do deal with release once a month? That's why we have a Dashor Community Council that we started three, four years ago now. I want to see one of your memos after a delivery. Are you like sending notes to the head? It's not even after the delivery. I'm texting, you know, not texting while I'm driving, but texting after I complete the order. From your deliveries, what have you learned? Everything. All of the details, everything from pay considerations, everything from operations at a store, which stores are a bit faster in their operations or more consistent, which stores are less consistent. Where do you find the last parking space in downtown San Francisco? All of these details matter. They matter for efficiency. They matter for driver pay. They matter for merchant earnings. And so as a result, you know, what I say to dashers is, please continue to talk to me. I'm just Tonya, Dordash. And we're always trying to, you know, make things better. We're not saying that we're perfect, but when we look at, you know, the data that we've collected, you know, the average dashers making $24.25 an hour nationwide when they're doing deliveries. And so, and most dashers are pretty satisfied. So Dordash has been expanding internationally. Sounds like you're on the road a lot. I'm on the road. I am on the road. US, Canada, Australia, Japan, where else? Where next? Germany, you know, Israel, Finland, a lot of the Nordics. So we're in 27 countries. And a lot of that is run by, you know, the VULT team that we were lucky to partner with. Beyond VULT, how are you thinking about M&A? Are there any verticals or areas in particular where you might be interested in acquiring? You know, we have five businesses, the US restaurants business, the new categories business with a focus on convenience and grocery. Non-US international 27 countries are B2B business and our ads business. So we have quite a full plate. On M&A specifically, it's a high bar. M&A I think sometimes looks a lot better on paper than can be achieved in reality. And I think it's because you're talking about at the end of the day, combining human organizations, not just businesses or products or lines on a spreadsheet. I think you have to deliver upon that promise. And so for us, the bar isn't just does it add to our business, but does it actually add to our culture? You've been piloting rapid delivery, right, rapid delivery, but rapid delivery seems to be contracting. What are you seeing in your pilots? Is this somewhere you think you'll expand or no? So I think customers are always going to have expectations that go in one direct.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1197,2022-11-20 13:18:49
18584," Band or no? So I think customers are always going to have expectations that go in one direction, right? I don't think we're gonna want things delivered more slowly over time or at higher prices or with less selection. Our core use case right now is lunch and dinner, which is highly repetitive, highly profitable, which allows us to invest in things like fast deliveries. I take that with great pride. I also take it with great responsibility. Remembering to invest in those who maybe don't come from privileged backgrounds. We will never break. We will never break. Build on a foundation strong enough to stay. We will never. On the David Rubenstein Show, here to peer conversations, I uncover the untold stories of the world's most successful leaders. Watch Wednesdays on Bloomberg Television. You bought chowbottix last year, but shut it down. This is robotic kiosks, right? I'm curious how you're thinking about AI and Uber shut down itself driving stuff and they've started it back up. How are you thinking about AI and moonshots and some of this potential new technology and how it could help DoorDash or not? Is it just not ready for prime time? When it comes to platform shifts or new technologies, AI, autonomy, other types of technologies, I tend to like to make the investment. I think that's a more appropriate choice to not miss the shift. However, I think it's very important to get the pacing right. I still think that the merits behind what we were trying to do in partnership with the chowbottix team was the right idea in which we can help restaurants effectively build a cheaper cost product. That's ultimately what we were trying to do, but we weren't ready yet with the technology. You recently joined MetaSport. What's it like working with Mark Zuckerberg? It's been fantastic. It's been a terrific learning experience. Learning from Mark all the way to the incredible management team at that company. It has a broad mandate of different products and as well as initiatives. It's been a privilege. Facebook had a very controversial platform. There's controversy about whether Facebook is really good for the world. Whether Facebook should have as much power as it should. How do you think about that and how are you advising Mark about how to use that power? With great power comes great responsibility. I think Facebook has a lot of influence. MetaSport is different properties as I'm sure you cover. Serve billions of people every single day. That's an enormous privilege and an enormous responsibility that they take incredibly seriously. Should any company be more powerful than multiple governments combined? I don't think I see it exactly that way. It's still a contract between the company and its users. I think what's important for MetaSport to do is how do we set the guard rails to make it fair, safe for everyone? This is very difficult. You're also an investor. One of them is Alchemy, Web 3 company. Any plans to accept crypto? Any plans for DoorDash to accept crypto? Crypto right now is...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1198,2022-11-20 13:23:01
18585," Different startups, one of them is Alchemy, Web3 Company, Yes. Any plans to accept crypto? Any plans for DoorDash to accept crypto? Crypto right now is going through a period where it's trying to figure out what's next in terms of its use case. I think everyone, myself included, very bullish on the technology of what the blockchain enables. What do you think could be the future of blockchain technology in food delivery, in delivery, in general? Well, I don't know if it's going to get applied directly to food or to delivery. I mean, I think it absolutely has the potential to create a new economic infrastructure, right? An economic infrastructure that can really serve as the basis for new banking systems, and et cetera. And so I think that's something more that's 10-general to the world of delivery. Obviously, payments is one part of what we do, but it's not the central thing. So we're going to do a little rapid fire now. A little quicker fun, questions, favorite food. I've ordered from 1,100 different DoorDash restaurants. Wow. So I actually like to try everything. Your business idle? There are people in retail that I've admired. The people that founded everything from Walmart to Costco. The team in Amazon, in e-commerce. The team Elon Musk and what he's trying to do. What about Elon Musk buying Twitter? If he has time to run a third company, I think that'd be fantastic for the world. You grew up in Illinois. You live in California. You like basketball. You're here. Basketball. Favorite game. Bulls. Bulls. Bulls, not warriors. I grew up in the golden days of Michael Jordan, Scotty Peppin, and actually, both the early 90s, as well as the later 90s, in which they won three in a row. I'm still a Bulls die hard, even though we're in a run patch right now. I hear you also like to run. You run marathons? Well, I don't run marathons today. So just to be clear. But I do run every day. So that's been my sanctuary, if you will, for the past 10 years. Your kids are still pretty young. How do you think having kids has changed you as a leader? I think kids are amazing in that they're experiencing the world for the first time, being able to listen versus to talk at or to dictate an opinion. I think that's been a big lesson. I think the second one is the power of curiosity. Kids, especially in my kids, at their ages of two and four, are asking the question, why a lot? And I think it's the best question. It's also so hard to answer, because it requires clarity of thinking on everything, on the most basic things to more complicated things. How has being an Asian-American CEO impacted your experience? Well, I think being an Asian growing up where I was the only Asian, and that was kind of my experience in Illinois, certainly had a big experience. And where it's very directly, I saw first-hand, whether it was bullying or discrimination. But I think if I were to more broadly classify that to the privileged position that I'm in today, I'm still a minority in the sense that there aren't as many Asian-American CEOs or founders, as maybe founders from other backgrounds. And so I think it's that reminder to one always recognize that. And then I think secondly to always keep the underdog mentality. Do you think you faced more challenges than others? Because Asian-American CEOs are so underrepresented. And Asian-Americans are underrepresented in leadership roles in tech. Full stop. I can't say that for me personally, in building DoorDash, was that the experience. But look, I think you're writing, calling out that when I look around me, I want to look at especially public company founders, CEOs, well, hey, there aren't that many, B, when you start filtering for those from Asian descent. It's a much, much smaller list. And so I take that with great pride. I also take it with great responsibility, really. And again, remembering to invest in those who maybe don't come from privileged backgrounds, giving them an equal shot at it and to always to stay so hungry.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1199,2022-11-20 13:27:30

You changed your name to Tony when you moved? Well, that's five, yeah. To the US, you were five years old after Tony Danza, who was the star of who's the boss. Correct. I loved that. I did. No one could pronounce my Chinese name. And so I said, OK, well, let's just make it easier. Yeah. And so I walked with my dad to the immigration office and legally changed my name. Did life change? Did it feel like life changed after that? It felt a lot easier to say, hi, I'm Tony. What's it like being the boss now? Honestly, I think I don't see myself that way. And I recognize that that's probably not how others view me. But I really view myself as a teammate. And for me, I think it's trying to make that actually true. Make the reality of how I feel, true to the perception that maybe others have of me as the boss and making that distance shorter and shorter. I mean just, it's just so reasonable to tell. Don't think that, however, it's quite acceptable that maybe they like Western Welcome to the world of decentralized finance, Bloomberg's covering all things crypto, the transactions and the technology.

What did it mean to be so young against those men? I think you'd just more fearless. You know, you're naive, which I definitely was when I went into boxing. But that helped me because I had a plan, I had a vision and strategy that many thought wasn't achievable. But because I wasn't tarnished with the bitterness of the boxing industry or that frustration of the boxing industry, I went with what I thought was achievable. I think it's still bitter and I've been around boxing since I was eight years old, but I've been working in boxing for 12 or 13 years. And it affects you because there's very little loyalty. The ups and downs of staging a major event around the world and then next week, the day before a fight is out with an injury or is he really injured? You know, you have to sleep with one eye over because it's a very competitive world in and outside of the ring. Well, you say there's no loyalty, but looking at you and your fighters, you're very close with them. I think of Anthony Joshua, for example. Yeah, I think but we really work off the basis of, if you want to be with us, then we will, of course, give you all the respect in the world. We don't tell lies. We're full of integrity. We're honest. We want to be a part of that journey with you. And sometimes you have relationships where it's almost as though contracts aren't required because you believe in someone so much, you know, and that could be Anthony Joshua or Katie Taylor. You know, before them, Tony Bell, you downbarco, Karl Frotch, people that, you know, you know, you know, wouldn't turn that back on you. And that's a nice feeling. And when they give you that loyalty, you give it back to them tenfold. So, but you're in a world. It's price fighting. Right. Now, these men and women are getting paid to fight. But when you are that close with them, does it prevent you from being fully objective? I want to be close with fighter because I want to wear my heart and my sleeve. The best nights for me are where I'm jumping up and down and considering diving over the rope, celebrating. Because again, it comes down to sport. I'm a failed athlete, really. If you asked me what I would have wanted to be, and as a kid growing up, was a sportsman. But this is the next best thing. You know, my dad always said to me, if you can get 1% of the adrenaline that a fighter gets when he walks to the ring or when he wins the World title, you're very lucky, man. And sometimes I feel like it's 60% or 70%. Or nerves before a fight, let's say. All the time. But, you know, things nerves, nerves slowly fade and eradicate as you get used to them. It's just like a fighter. Now, when you make that walk for the first time, it's very different to when you make that walk for the seventh or eighth time. It's just like doing a press conference. You know, the first press conference I ever did, the major one was for the World Heavyweight title. I was shaking, I had to sit on my hands while I was speaking. Now, you know, I'm quite famous, but I don't have notes. Yeah, well speaking of which, Eddie, do you consider yourself a salesman? Absolutely. That's my greatest skill. That's all I have. Really? So how integral is Eddie as the showman? Eddie is the celebrity to match room into your fight? Well, that's what we've built over the last decade or so, is building the brand of matrim, but building my brand to make sure that you're not always solely reliant on talent. Talent is always key to a boxing business or any sports business. But if you can build your own brand, so to speak, and we, you know, they know what? Who is someone that I'm, you know, very fond of and I have a lot of respect for at the UFC. I model and we copy a lot of what the UFC do and I openly tell them. And that's a big compliment to them. But the UFC really has just shot up out of nowhere. But that's really part of that growth has been, Dana White. Right. Are you worried they're stealing your audience though? That's an amazing thing. No, I think it's a different audience, but I think it can also coexist together. You know, and I think, you know, I went to the UFC London, and the reason is my first time loved it. You know, different crowd. You know, not everyone knew what I was, whereas if I went to a boxing show, everyone would. So, but it's, it's fight schools. So it's, you know, I think they can coexist together. Great organisation, great vision, great, you know, and the pattern of growth globally and the kind of thing that we're looking to achieve as well.

Is there an element of the business of?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1201,2022-11-20 13:39:03
18588," But there are a lot of boxing purists out there who would look at, you know, setting up a fight between two YouTube stars and say, this isn't the sport. Is there an element of the business of boxing taking away from the sport of boxing? I think in anything that you do, you always have the temptation to, I wouldn't even call it sell out, but to move away, the reality is the hardcore element of any industry is a much smaller market than the casual audience within that market. And that's so true in boxing. Hardcore boxing fans who are the beating heart of the sport are a small minority versus a potential audience for a YouTube fight between KSI and Logan Paul. You have to keep evolving, you have to keep trying things. It's hard for me because I'm a hardcore boxing fan. Does that make you uncomfortable? When I did that fight at Stakeham Centre in L.A., it was incredible. We had 7 million people watching the press conference. We had 15,000 in Los Angeles. The viewing figures were huge globally. But I did feel very uncomfortable at the press conference. Would you do something like that again? No, I wouldn't. But I learned, I understood the audience. That was good also to talk about my brain. That introduced me to a whole other world. When I'm walking down the street, different people are talking to me now through that event. So you see you wouldn't do a fight like that again, but is there some degree to which that's inevitable that that's the way the world's moving? Yeah, I think you know, you've got someone like Jake Paul who has turned YouTube at two-boxer. So that's kind of you get away with that. But YouTube versus YouTube, I'd like to think that our businesses in a position where we don't have to necessarily go down that route. I feel like it's important to concentrate on real boxing, which still has a huge amount of growth to take part globally. But we're also led by numbers. We're led by subscription, we're led by gate receipts, and clearly that was an event that was extremely successful. Coming up, Eddie Hurn talks about taking on America. You know, we upset a lot of people. Every door that we tried to go through was being shuttled. Everything you need to get set for the start of U.S. trading, Bloomberg, the open with Jonathan Terrell, drilling down in the numbers and preparing you as only Bloomberg can weekdays on Bloomberg. Welcome back to Bloomberg Power Players. It was 2018 and Eddie Hurn signed a groundbreaking broadcasting agreement with the streaming giant DeZone. The deal with his company, Matron Boxing, was worth a billion dollars over eight years, making hand the sports first billion dollar promoter. Let's rejoin Danny Berger, who puts Eddie Hurn on the spot about big TV deals. You first heard yourself called a billion dollar promoter. What do they make you think? It was a nice feeling. We made a lot of mistakes when we went into America. I think sometimes the marketplace and America in general won't quite recognize the British humour or sarcasm. I think you might have heard of that. I went in very bullish. There was a big debate about when we did that billion dollar deal with DeZone, do we tell anyone how big that deal was? My response was, yeah, absolutely.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1202,2022-11-20 13:43:16
18589," big debate about when we did that billion dollar deal with design. Do we tell anyone how big that deal was? And my response was, yeah, absolutely. That's me. Because I think if you're going into a marketplace with no brand presence, no brand profile, you have to make waves. You have to create noise. And I'm not a believer in moving in quietly and slowly taking our time. But there was a debate going on this time that maybe that was an approach that worked for us. But I don't feel that's my mantra or my style. I wanted to go in there. And I wanted to be a disruptor. You talk about. I think it's worked. Yeah, I do. But it took three years to work. And I thought it would work instantly with the budget that we had. We upset a lot of people. Every door that we tried to go through was being shut on us by the industry. Why would you want to let this Brit into our market? We almost have to get together to stop him. But at the same time, it's the worst thing you could do to me. Because that made me work 10 times harder and made me 10 times more committed personally to get to where we wanted to get to. And fast forward three or four years on, and particularly designing of Canelo Alvarez, the pound for pound number one, the Biggest Star in America has put us on the map as really the biggest promotional company in America. How do you weigh that up between growing globally with Canelo, for example, versus retaining that mom and pop, UK family run feel of this business? The beauty of our business is we are a family business. And the story of Mattrium is incredible when you think that 40 years ago this year, this business was created under a snooker hole in Rompford by my dad and Steve Dawson, who's still here, and he's secretary, who's still here, 40 years on. And any family business, I think the most difficult thing is to transform that family business to a big national business, to a global powerhouse. Because it's the transition. You come from a different mentality as a family business, but that's helped us in our mindset. Here at Mattrium, we very rarely, although we are having to now, recruit us at the senior level. All our senior executives, all our board members have come from 15 years old, 16 years old. Because you have to understand the mindset that we have. We take this very personally. How do you make sure there's diversity than when it is people who have been with the business for so long, especially in a very male-dominated world? I mean, some of our senior directors here are female. I mean, my sister sits on the board, she's the former producer for Premier League Football Sky. Emily Fraser, who runs our multi-sport division, started at 17 in this business. So it's about giving people opportunity, of course. And now, because of the growth globally, we are having to see some senior, senior highers come in, as we move to the inevitable stage, probably, of an IPO in years to come. And that's my mindset. We got to a place probably 10 years ago, and my dad said, I can't believe where this business comes from. Why do I IPO? Why is that in the future? Because for me, I feel like that's the next general step of succession, of success, of growth. What are the fundamental next steps you can take to prove yourself as a global powerhouse? And that's something that we will consider in time. The only way I can be recognized is to outperform anything that might that ever achieve. So to take the business from major national business, which are two international global powerhouse, talk about floating on the New York Stock Exchange. But is there not a fair, you obviously become beholden to these shareholders who have perhaps different goals than you? Definitely, but you have to weigh that up with growth. This is an ongoing argument with me and my dad. And probably, it's only in the last year or so, he started to understand my ambition of, we can't be that family business and move globally in the way and with the speed that I want to. So something's got to give. And he always said, I will never. We're not answering to anyone. We do what we want. We make our decisions. And maybe it'll stay like that. But we also understand that you get to a point that to reach the next level, you have to make changes. And so is that you disagreeing with them then? Yeah, absolutely. We disagree all the time.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1203,2022-11-20 13:47:36
18590," But we also understand that you get to a point that to reach the next level, you have to make changes. And so is that you disagreeing with him then? Yeah, absolutely. We disagree all the time. You know, I mean, he's happy where we are. And numbers are through the roof. You know, the growth over the last five, ten years has been incredible. And you know, as a standalone family business, probably one of the biggest in the country. Yeah. Well, to that growth point, we're talking about that Gizon deal in 2018. At the time you had said the growth is not in paper view, it's streaming. Do you still stand behind that? Yeah, I do. I think that there will be certain fights and there will be certain individuals that the paper view model will only ever exist for. Canelo Avera is a good example. And Sejoshua in big fights against Oosik, Taisen Fury. But we made our move away from Sky, which was our boxing broadcast of the 12 years, because we felt there was too much paper. Is that a hard decision to make? It was, but again, it's still built behind the global mindset. DeZone gave us the opportunity and the ability to create localized events in markets of great importance. And we couldn't do that with Sky. And of course, the money was significantly more. I mean, I think about broadcasting rates and they feel like they're hotter than ever for sports. You have an Amazon getting into the game with tennis, football. Have they reached out to you at all? Yeah, of course. We speak to all broadcasters, all broadcasters, all broadcasters, all broadcasters. But you do something like that? Yeah, I mean, we're in a great position where we're content owners. We're rights holders. We run sports, different sports, 10, 11, 12 sports, where we create global calendars as almost the governing bodies for those sports. So we own the IP. So we're extremely powerful in that position in a world, as you said, where sports rights are becoming more and more valuable. So the emergence of streaming partners, whether it's Amazon, whether it's, of course, to zone for a huge partner of ours. And Sky, all these linear broadcasters as well, are emerging their digital offerings. It doesn't matter if it's Sky or BBC or ITV, BBC iPlayer, now all of a sudden become huge. I mean, we just did the World Snooker Finals in Sheffield, 4.4 million audience for the final huge numbers. And across our player, you look at the numbers from their digital offering. And that is the future. And that's one of the reasons we made the move, not just because of the money and the ability to grow globally, but because we truly believe that streaming is the future. Coming up, Eddie Herndt tells Bloomberg what the future holds for women's boxing. Watch Bloomberg surveillance early edition for the news you need when you need it.

Can it sustain its normal at a time when everybody else is facing a very different reality? Bloomberg surveillance. Be informed. Be prepared. Be ahead of the game. Welcome back to Bloomberg Power Players. So what about the future of boxing? Recently Eddie Herndt promoted the fight between the Irish Boxer Katie Taylor and the Puerto Rican fighter Amanda Serrano. It was at Madison Square Garden. It was in New York and the bout was described as the biggest women's fight of all time. It's one of many big changes in the sport according to Eddie Herndt.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1204,2022-11-20 13:51:57
18591," of all time. Now it's one of many big changes in the sport according to Eddie Herne. In terms of looking towards the future, what is women's boxing going to be? Women's boxing obviously through April 30th at Madison Square Garden has changed forever and actually it's quite funny because I'm negotiating a fight at the moment. It's not as big as Taylor Sorano but it's a big fight, you know, it's a big undisputed fight in women's boxing and I would say that the value of that fight prior to Taylor Sorano has at least trebled and the numbers that are being offered back and forward are numbers that I never expected to see. I mean it was well documented both fighters made in excess of seven figures at Madison Square Garden which was groundbreaking. Now I'm not saying that's going to be a norm but the money now in women's boxing is significant change. What do you think would be the normal then? I mean you know for a major fight like that they could be making six figures or just over you know, 100 and 15. Is it hard to call to beat the talent in this world? It's hard that the problem with women's boxing is the deepness of talent, you know. So the high end, the elite level of women's boxing is incredible KT Taylor Sorano but there are, you know, in the male side of the sport, you know, you could make 10 great fights in the division in women's boxing maybe it's just one fight in the division but that's changing because these individuals are setting the standard, raising the bar, you know, paving the way for young female fighters to actually have a big future within the sport. We're seeing more female fighters than ever walk through the doors of local boxing clubs within the community. Eddie, do you get pushback on okay so in one hand you know this groundbreaking fight with women in boxing and all the other hands you know setting up fights in Saudi where women only just recently were able to drive. Not really and you know one of the the mindsets of Saudis to try and bring women's boxing into those events. So I think that you know we've staged one event in Saudi which came with some criticism but also was a huge success. Personally did it feel strange? Not really because you know I was dealing with people, individuals, you know, the sports authority there that I saw the vision that they have and you know you always get the difficult questions but from a sport infrastructure perspective and from a building of sport within that region for me it's exciting. So don't think it tarnishes the recognition. I don't think so and you know what as well. It's price fighting. It's very difficult for me to say to a fighter who is put in their life on the line every time they walk through the ring. You have an opportunity here to afford a fight. I gotta tell you though if you have shareholders after you IPO this kind of stuff is important to them this ESG stuff. Yeah maybe and you know that's either side we look at or we move down the barri-home route of you know we make the decisions we believe in. I think that we have an obligation to our fighters to maximize their earnings and their revenue in a very dangerous sport and I don't want to lean on PGA Tour Formula One, WWE but these are organizations that are hard for me to say this. Substantially bigger than ours that are willing to move into that marketplace and stage major events and I just feel that sometimes people don't understand boxing. If I can make my client five times more to stage a mega fight when I understand and have seen first hand the risks involved in boxing then it's something we always have to consider. You could change one thing about your sport what would it be? Well I think it would be the ability to make the biggest fights possible in the sport and the problem with boxing versus UFC for example is you know you have different broadcasters you have different promoters. My job is to deliver the best fights for design. Our Hayman's best job is to deliver the best fights for Fox. Bob Arram's job is to deliver the best fights for ESPN and no one really wants to give and take and share. You look into dominate the marketplace with the best product. So the frustration of fight fans versus the UFC where they have a blanket policy and fight is quite frankly a told what.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1205,2022-11-20 13:56:14
18592," ways with the best product. So the frustration of fire fans versus the UFC, where they have a blanket policy, and the fight is quite frankly a told what fighters was for the purpose of the fight. And a lot of them prevented from boxing as well, because of that. And you know, but that's, but also the great thing about the UFC business, as I said, is the ability of every MMA fighter wants to be a UFC fighter. And we want to create that same ethos. So could boxing ever move to that model of one? We have approaches all the time for people who say, can we roll up boxing? Any names you want to give us? No, but can we buy a boxing? And the answer is no, you can't. But we can get there naturally, through being consistent, through being good enough, and through having a relentless work ethic that will make us unbeatable. Anyone that's questioned for me, what do you think is the biggest challenge this year and beyond? Time. You know, time, the engine, you know, the love and just, you know, keep doing what you're doing. The sport can be very frustrating. The business can be very frustrating. You know, you can build something and create it. And a day before, it can all fall apart. And you know, you could be on your knees saying, why do I bother? And the reason is because I love what I do. But the challenge is time. You know, we're creating 55 nights a year at the moment. And we want to get to a stage where we're staging two events a week globally. So the biggest challenge is to manage that growth as a company that came from a cupboard in Romford. I wish I had more time too. Very good to have to end it there. Thank you so much. Thank you. That's all for this episode of Blumberg Power Players. We'll be back soon with another influential figure from the world of sport. Next time around. What do you think of when you think of a battery? For most, it's what we use to power devices for both work and play and maybe even your car. Over the past few decades, they've gotten way more powerful, long-lasting and affordable. But all of this is just a prologue to what the next batteries are going to do. As we drive to an increasingly renewable power-driven grid, we also need to be able to store energy and release it later to cover those periods of weather intermittencies that are driving this new grid that we're in. It's a multi-trillion dollar opportunity and it's imperative that we figure out the solution here. How we store energy on a massive scale is in many ways the central challenge of the fight to stop climate change. Access the financial world on demand.

So before you invent pioneer, disrupt. Before you change the world, Bloomberg. And former Fed Vice Chair Rich Clarita on the liquidity problem in the Treasury's market. And what can be done about it? It was a week of hoping. Hoping that things just might start to move in a better direction in US-China relations. After President Biden's meeting in Bali with President Xi. I absolutely believe there's need not be a new co-war. I do not think there's any imminent attempt on the part of China to invade Taiwan. And I made it clear that our policy in Taiwan has not changed at all. Hoping that inflation may just be easing a bit in the United States. With Fed Vice Chair Leo Brainer telling Bloomberg, we might see a bit of moderation in rate hikes. I think it will probably be appropriate to move to a slower pace of increases. But I think what's really important to emphasize, we've done a lot. But we have additional work to do both on raising rates and sustaining restraint to bring inflation down. Hoping that the new British government has gotten the message. As it put forth a new budget designed to reassure the markets. So today we deliver a plan to tackle the cost of living crisis and rebuild our economy. Our priorities are stability, growth, and public services. And then of course, there's that special kind of hope that former President Trump brings to everything he does. Deciding that despite what happened in the midterms to his hand-picked candidates. This was the right time to announce he's running again for President. In order to make America great and glorious again, I am tonight announcing my candidacy for President of the United States. Even as prominent investor and Republican supporter Ken Griffin of Citadel couldn't find much to hope for, Mr. Trump's candidacy. He lost in 2020. We lost Georgia because of his behavior in the Senate race in 2020. That's a second loss. And then this year the Republicans lost the Senate because the Trump-backed candidates in the Senate races were rejected by American voters. That's a three-time loser. And I'd like to think that the Republican party is ready to move on from somebody who's been for this party a three-time loser. But whatever we were all hoping for this week, we didn't really get that much out of the markets, which traded without real conviction. With the S&P 500 off, just 7-10s of a percent for the week and the Nasdaq down 1.57 percent. And the yield on the 10 year up about seven basis points ending the week at 3.82. To help us sort it all out, we welcome now a sunny, bachelor, CEO of Rock Creek and Bob Michael. He's chief investment officer and head of the Global Fixed Income Unit at JPMorgan Asset Management. So welcome both you. Great to have you back. Bob, let me start with you. I mean, I watched the ECO numbers. I listened to the Fed speak. I sort of felt like I was going both ways at the same time. What did you see? Well, for a bond investor, all of us who have been battered this...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1207,2022-11-20 14:04:55
18594," I listened to the Fed speak. I sort of felt like I was going both ways at the same time. What did you see? Well, for a bond investor, all of us who have been battered this year, this is one of the weeks that made sense to us. We had a nice tailwind coming in from the inflation data. It was great all the way through core. When you look at shelter, everything, yes, the markets went a little crazy. They went wild, and the central bankers did what they're supposed to do. They came in one by one and reminded us, don't declare victory yet. These are only a couple prints. There are more hikes to come, but maybe there is some optimism. And the market settled down. So I look at this week, and I thought, this is the first great week in a long time. So, Sonny, is that the way you saw it as well? And there's still some more red hikes to come? How many? I think at least another three to start with. 50 basis points next time in December, followed by at least two or three 25 basis points next year. And then we'll see from there. And I think what Bob said is very true at the same time as we were listening to at least three Fed people come and speak. I wrote down, I think they all had very different codes. And you had some of that when Leibber not talked. But you also had the president of St. Louis Fed say something slightly different, as if we would start continue with rate increases for a while longer than she had implied. And then, of course, we had Susan Collins come in today with even sort of potential 75 basis points. So we're hearing numbers that are a little bit all over the place and trying to make sense of it. So Bob, are the markets making it harder for the Fed as a practical matter? They were at the start of the week. I think not so much now. I think we're all in the same spot. We've all got realistic expectations. The Fed's headed to 4.5%. They'll get there some time in the first quarter. We'll see where inflation is. If it's below the Fed funds rate, then that gives them some scope to pause on the tightening. We can reevaluate at that point. But right now, bon yotes have gone up a long way in a very short period of time. It's time for a breath. Bob, does that get us to a soft landing? Unfortunately, it does not. And I think that's the one consistent message from the Fed. Susan Collins aside, which is there is going to be pain for businesses and households. When you have this magnitude of rate hikes in such a short period, and you're also withdrawing liquidity through quantitative tightening, it's going to bite. And we're already seeing it's biting the economy hard. Thankfully, it's also now starting to bite inflation. So I want to pick up on the liquidity. Just for a moment, if I could have some here, how big a problem do we have in the Treasury market now with the liquidity? I hear conflicting things, but some people are very concerned about it. Big problems, I think Bob leaves it much more than I do. But as you know, they're very big problems with the trading volumes. And for big traders or even small traders, getting a bit is becoming much harder and you're working in a much less liquid environment. And I know between Treasury and the banks, there have been a lot of meetings, but I'm not so sure if we have a solution yet. Well, Bob, could the Fed make it easier with some regulatory changes? It could. But I think the moaning that we hear in the bond market about liquidity, it's always there. We always complain. We don't get the price we want. The reality is, for the last couple weeks, you could have moved your portfolio in any direction you wanted up and down duration, up and down credit risk without any kind of penalty. So I'm not that big a believer in the lack of liquidity. I'm sorry when we talk about a soft landing, it brings me back to oil because oil did move this week and it moved down in the price of oil. And most people I talked to suggested it was in part because of a concern about global recession, really a backing off or at least a softening in the markets. You came out of that business. You really know energy backwards and forwards. What are we seeing in oil? So as you said, oil prices did, the future numbers went down below 80, which was a big shift from a little while ago. But my view is still that we might just avoid a recession in the US if we're fortunate. But we may not be.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1208,2022-11-20 14:09:19
18595," a big shift from a little while ago. But my view is still that we might just avoid a recession in the U.S. if we are fortunate. But we may not be able to avoid it in Europe and the rest of the world. And a lot of the, I think, softness for these numbers that we saw today and in recent days is because of the expectations in China. Now, China is starting to open up a little bit maybe and loosen its COVID rules, but that's going to take a while. And I think that softening is softening the oil markets and will probably continue to do that. Is it opening up? I mean, I'm not exactly sure exactly what's happening because on the one hand, we hear them saying things that sound a little softer on zero COVID and in the end, we hear about a lot of cases. So it is, it was kind of interesting. We had a team out in Asia this week. And they came back with interesting news that there is actually some physical opening up. But now you have people who are afraid to go out because they've been told so long that they're, if they go out, they'll get COVID. And so you have seen a very different phenomenon, which is actual, you know, individuals not wanting to go out of their houses versus the government, which has been very strict about you're getting out of your house. I'm sorry, I was at the G20, of course, meeting with Mabali. And some people thought there would be no single statement coming out of it. They did come to some agreement in part driven by some of the developing countries. Should that be encouraging to investors, actually, that we're getting back perhaps a little toward multilateral cooperation? Much more positive news came out of the G20 than we all expected. And as you said, there was also a lot of big stress on reform of the multilateral lending because the big news out of that meeting was that there's huge needs when it comes particularly to emerging markets, climate-related investments. And there's no way with the existing finances of the multilateral that that could be met. So that was why there was a lot of emphasis on the reform of the multilateral sector, but also getting the multilateral to work much better with the private sector to generate more resources. And you saw that very particular case of Indonesia, which was discussed a lot and written up a lot with about $20 billion going into replace coal in Indonesia with cleaner fuels. About another important development this week, sort of a rolling development is the outcomes of the midterm elections. We found out that the Democrats will hold on to the Senate. The Republicans will get a narrow majority in the House. What does that communicate if anything to investors? Is that sort of a steady as you go way because we have a split government not much is going to happen either way? So, for sure, I will tell you, going back to the G20, we're actually hearing from clients, large institutional clients, that they're more confident about allocating to markets when the G20 countries are talking to one another again and working with one another again. So that's a huge positive. I don't remember that in gosh over a decade. When you go back to the gridlock in Washington, I hate to say it, but the markets kind of like it. When there are dramatic policy changes, you have to reprice everything in the markets. It becomes destabilizing. There are always going to be some winners. There are going to be some losers. This time, if we know we're going to have gridlock, we can focus on bringing inflation down and trying to avoid a recession and have a soft land. I think a lot of people in the street think that it's sort of hypocritic. First, do no harm. If you're not doing anything, you're not messing things up. Bob Michael of JPMorgan and I have to say, a bachelor's of rock week, we'll be staying with this as we look at what this week meant for our investment decisions.

18596," Music Back in 1997, I was interested in the following question, which is there are a bunch of the dinosaurs called Saurapod dinosaurs. Which had really long skinny necks, so Apatosaurus is an example. Now, I said really long skinny tails. So, I made a computer model that showed that in fact the tail of these Saurapod dinosaurs could actually act like a whip, a bullfip. Now, the way a bullfip makes that cracking noise is because the tip of the whip actually goes about twice the speed of sound. And that crack is a sonic boom. I think the way they got a date was to impress the females by making loud booms. Music From the world of politics to the world of business, balance of power with David Weston, views and analysis inside from and about politics power players, weekdays, this is Bloomberg. Music We think it will create some of the most valuable companies the markets have ever seen. I think it's certainly driven companies like Cisco, given them the life that they've had. It's obviously also spectacularly volatile, but the market has pulled back in this sector since it came public since it began in 1995. It's pulled back 30 to 50 percent at least seven or eight times. That was Henry Blodgett talking about the internet and tech on Wall Street way back in June of 2000. When the number one movie in the country was Mission Impossible 2 and the most popular song in the country was Maria Maria by Santana. Michael of JPMorgan and of Sonny Bachelors of Rod Creek are still with us. So, Sonny certainly Mr. Blodgett was right that we gave us some awfully big and successful companies. No question about it. Some people thought that would happen as well in the crypto space. This week we're not quite as sure after FTX. What do we make of that? Is that, does that have broader significance in the markets or is it just a one off? Hopefully it is more limited. I think there's no question that without regulation and we've all been talking about having this sector regulated. It would help. It's the market itself, but also the investors going in having this particular come, you know, FTX, which is an exchange core crypto. We're going to be based in the Bahamas with not just no regulation, but also with a few people who had very limited experience in finance or in anything really. I think the shocking part of it, David, was that very, very sophisticated venture firms from Sequoia and others who were invested. It was not just retail getting involved in that market. So, it was a surprise, but hopefully it will get limited. It has put a lot of pressure on increasing regulation sooner here. And that will be a good thing for the market. Now, let's not forget that the whole market is less than, you know, a 900 billion. I'm not saying that that's tiny, but it's still not significant enough to create any kind of stress in the market. Unless we're missing something that we don't know at this point. I think what's important, David, when you watch that clip and that was the absolute peak in the dot com bubble. Yes, there was a massive shakeout. There was a massive consolidation. But I would argue the internet and tech evolved far beyond what any of us ever thought it would be in 2000. I wonder if we're going through the same thing with crypto and NFTs that it got a great start. There is going to be a shakeout of Sonia's right. There's probably going to be a lot of regulation. But when I talk to the young people on our desk and our platform, there's still a big believer. And if the millennials are a believer, 22 years from now, they're going to be looking at this clip.

18597," and if the millennials are a believer, 22 years from now, they're gonna be looking at this clip. And I hope we got it right. That's fascinating. There is no question as a generational issue here. Let's come back to the current generation and people who's old as I am. I'm older than you are, but it's all I'm, what about bonds right now? Do you invest in bonds? For the first time in a decade, absolutely. And I will tell you that we're seeing interest from everywhere now. Every wealth management platform in JP Morgan, every institutional client, they're coming to us, they're putting money in bonds, they're looking to commit more, and they haven't done so for years. If I look at where we got to at the start of the year, a general bond fund, the Bloomberg Ag, yielded 1.7%. Now we're up at 4.7%. We have 3% higher yields, and that's going to track investment. And as I said, I think the Fed is closely in. I don't know if they get to 5%, we're kind of in the 4.5, 4.3 quarters percent. That's going to bring a lot of stability to the market at these levels. Bonds are back. So I'm saying you manage a fair amount of money. What about for you, are bonds attractive at this point or are you just equities? I think as said, what is very interesting right now is even in any foundation or endowment or the assets that we manage, you're finding exactly the same phenomenon where people had moved away from bonds and cash, and we're all equities and private investments moving back into holding bonds. And as we're sort of reaching that 4.5%, that Bob talked about, much more interest in bonds in a more balanced kind of portfolio. And of course, people are looking at cash with 4% at the treasury bills at the level that is much higher than cash was earned in a very long time. But I think the bigger thing that is happening in the portfolio we're looking at is obviously a lot of investors, institution investors who've been also investing in venture private equity, real estate in private form. And I think that is going to some sort of transformation too. Well, let's take a segue if we could from that sort of investment into COP27. As we're speaking right now, it's still going to end on Saturday. Right now of sunny, you know far better than I do. It looks like it's going to be difficult for them to get to the objectives that they had. You're absolutely right. So far as we know tonight, the latest news was not too positive, not things could change tomorrow morning, but they didn't really have anything major to announce. Again, as you remember in COP26, they had the G-Fans, which was a large number of large asset managers signing up to make pretty significant shifts in their carbon print. But most recently, they started walking back from that or not wanting to sign quite on what they had agreed to in COP26. So I think it's very, very important as we're having these meetings, maybe they shouldn't be every year. Maybe they should be every other year or less often, but show some sort of progress. And the most important part of the discussion this time, David, has been a fact that developing countries again have felt that they are in some cases suffering because if they're an island economy, they're going underwater, if they are affected by droughts and by floods. A lot of it might be caused by those who did use a lot of carbon over the last 10, 20 years, and they're asking if they could get help. And that help is really not coming. And I think that is the really major summary of COP27, which is that the expectations of investments into climate are probably less than what we expected going into the COP. Well, and just picking up on that on the investments in it, Bob, I want to come back to you, because one of the things that I'm taking away from COP27, you can certainly hear, listen to John Kerry, the president's special envoy on this subject. We're not going to get to it from public money alone. It's going to take a fair amount of private investment as a bond person. Are there bonds that are green bonds or in the climate area that make sense as a business matter? There are.

18598," There are. I think for sure if you're going to finance something which is what bond investors do, you want something that has something of a green agenda to it. And we're hearing that from our clients. There's more and more money coming into the space. I think Afsania help is on the way for the island economies. The large-scale investors want to commit capital to this space. Well, the inflation reduction act, as it's called, a lot of people object to that title, put a lot of money into the game here on that private side of something. Is it making a difference in the projects that are getting financed? No question. I think the RA is a very powerful act and it's the largest amount of money going in. And I think that will really help us in the US to invest a lot more in climate-related food and ag, in battery storage, in residential and in community-related solar and wind. So that will be a major, major push. And we're seeing, as Bob mentioned, a lot of movement. I agree with him. I think it's just that in COP where you expected public money to go in, there was a sort of disappointment with that. But the private sector is doing a lot. The young generation is doing a lot. We just need the public sector to jump in when it comes to it outside of the IRA, of course. Bob, last word, are you seeing a difference in your part of the business for the government tax policy when it comes to green bonds? We are. Yeah, absolutely. It's making a real difference, you see it? It is from our perspective. Everything we see, and we didn't touch on the regulation, there's going to be more regulation poking through what qualifies as a green bond or not, and also to prevent any green washing, either in specific bonds or in bond funds. So watch this space. Yeah, okay, we're interested, particularly with the new Congress coming in. Thank you so much. Really great to have both you with us. This is Fsani Beshlas of Rock Creek and Bob Michael of J.P. Morgan. Coming up, we are going to take a look at next week on Wall Street all around the world. That's here. I'm Bloomberg. I think that it's hard to put your head around any narrative. Let's just be honest. We've had sort of a shift in are we in some sort of circulation fears?

18599," big elections. Now, in Malaysia, voting took place their Saturday just over a month after parliament was dissolved for a snap poll. And then meanwhile, Taiwan, that holds midterms this coming weekend. So that's going to be a pulse check on the popularity of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, as of course we see geopolitical tensions continue to rise in the region. ECO wise, the highlight is on central bank meetings in Korea and New Zealand. And we're going to be live from Seoul for the B-OK with expectations there for a half point hike. Plus, the Arby and Zed predicted to deliver its 6th straight 50 basis point move. The 2022 World Cup kicks off on Sunday in Qatar. The tournament is being held in the winter for the first time due to the blistering summer temperatures in the region. Thursday, C's week decision by Sweden's Riksbank, economist forecast 75 basis point hike, but surging food prices could tip the bank to raise by even more. We'll also on the same day get an account of the ECB's most recent policy meeting. And last, certainly not least, you energy ministers will be meeting to discuss policy outlook as Europe heads into the winter. A holiday shortened week for the observance of Thanksgiving Day, the main focal point for the week, it will center around the release of the FOMC minutes from that November meeting, a meeting that saw the Fed raise interest rates by 75 basis points for a fourth straight time. The Chair Jerome Powell said then that U.S. interest rates would go higher than earlier projected, but several Fed members since have indicated that they may be ready to downshift. A handful of earnings next week to watch, including Zoom video, deer, analog devices, best buy, and Nordstrom, keep an eye on those last two for a read on the strength of the consumer as the traditional kickoff to the holiday shopping season in the U.S. begins on Friday. The main theme to watch there will be the flight to discounted items by cash-strapped consumers that seem willing to spend, but maybe not have the same capacity as they did a year ago. David? Thanks to Annabelle Druller's Danny Burger and Romaine Bostic. Coming up, we saw it happen in the guilt market. Could a crisis come to the markets for U.S. treasuries? And would it come from a lack of liquidity? We're going to ask former vice chair of the Fed, Richard Clarita of FOMCO. This next on Wall Street Week on Bloomberg. When U.S. jobs numbers are released, Bloomberg brings you crucial data at terminal speed and instant expert analysis. Nobody covers jobs day like Bloomberg. Big, expensive cities have a lot going for them. But if you live in one, you probably notice that these big, expensive cities keep getting more, well, expensive. You could always move away. You might have just started working remotely, so there's really nothing keeping you there. But then again, moving is a hassle. Well, what if someone paid you 10 grand to do it? What if they threw in free office space, a bicycle, or a gym membership? Programs and cities and states around the U.S. are doing exactly that, and they're getting a lot of interest. We've had over 50,000 applications. About 90,000 applications. We've had over 1800 applicants from all over North America. So are these nascent programs actually beneficial to their communities and the workers joining them?

18600," or these nascent programs actually beneficial to their communities and the workers joining them. Or are they little more than flashy advertising campaigns for places looking for an injection of fresh talent? This is Walter E.R.I. I'm David Weston and we spent a good deal of this week trying to figure out where the Fed is heading on rate increases. And part of what we were watching was the Fed's vice chair, Leo Brandard, who gave us at least some hope that we might be getting closer to slowing down. I think it will probably be appropriate soon to move to a slower pace of increases. But I think what's really important to emphasize, we've done a lot, but we have additional work to do both on raising rates and sustaining restraint to bring inflation down. We welcome now, Ms. Brandard's predecessor as vice chair Richard Clarita, now global economic advisor to Pymco. Richard, thank you so much for being back with us. Good to have you back with us. So do you agree with your successor there? Do you think we're at least approaching a point where we might slow down the pace of increases? David, I do. You know, the Fed has done a lot this year. In fact, it will be the fastest pace of rate hikes since the early 1980s. I do anticipate that at the December meeting, they'll slow the pace from 75 to 50 basis points. And I think as we move into 2023, I think they think and I agree that they're close at least to a pause, probably in the first half of next year. They said in the November statement, they've done a lot and they want to see how the rate hikes are impacting the economy. So Richard, you have the advantage of having been in the room and having been in the room relatively recently. Give us a sense of what they're looking at their dashboard. Because I'm going to say the economic numbers sometimes point in different directions. On the one hand, we do have some indications like the CPI numbers that may be slowing down a little bit. The inflation on the other hand, the overall inflation is still pretty high. It is and you know, the challenge the Fed faces and other central banks in the world is that the economy is running hot and in particular wages in the economy are growing much faster than consistent with the 2% longer run goal. So I think that the Fed will be looking at the labor market data. It'll also be looking at inflation expectations. We have downshifted demand growth. You know, there's an imbalance between demand and supply. And this year demand growth has already downshifted. So that's an important thing to note. We're certainly along the way to where we need to be. But the Fed has more to do and we need to get inflation back down towards the 2% objective. So everyone seems to agree there's more for the Fed to be done. We just heard Leo Brenner say exactly that. The question is how much more and part of the question is what's the terminal rate? I mean, how far up do we go? We had some somewhat conflicting indications this week actually. And the banks basically project these things are coming with very different sorts of answers. What determines that terminal rate? And let me ask you, perhaps more pointedly, some people think the Fed was a little slow getting off the market and getting going. Does the slowness of getting started mean the terminal rate? We'll have to be higher necessarily. David, I don't think so. I think what what what launching the rate heights in March did mean. And I think chair Powell recognized this pretty early on. Was that it made sense to get to the destination pretty quickly. And that's why we've had the four successive 75 basis point. Hi, my sense right now is the committee believes and I share the view that my baseline view is I want to get the funds rate around 5% if the inflation data comes in on the soft side, maybe 4 3 quarters. If it comes in on the hot side, maybe 5 and a quarter, or perhaps as President Ballard indicated, maybe north of that, but I think around 5% in the spring will be at a level. The",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1214,2022-11-20 14:35:20
18601," comes in on the hot side, maybe five in a quarter, or perhaps as President Ballard indicated, maybe north of that. But I think around five percent in the spring will be at a level where they've done a lot, they realize that inflation responds to policy with a lag. And I think that that will be a good place to take stock. So I think that I wouldn't call that necessarily the terminal rate. I hope it is. If the inflation data doesn't improve, then they may have to do more. But I think they will pause at around five percent. So Richard, I think you just put the figure on the thing that at least perplexes me, which is it two-place function. I mean, you've got what the rates are. You also have what inflation is. And how restrictive that is depends on how far and how fast inflation comes down. So going into the spring, if you're at five percent, how far down do you get, need to get inflation before you say, okay, that's restrictive enough? It's an excellent point because typically monetary policy does operate with a lag. So the Fed wants to look ahead. And indeed, for example, Governor Waller and others have made reference to comparing the policy rate to where professional forecasters think inflation will be towards the end of the year. And I appreciate that point. My own research actually indicates that's a simple thing to do. I think the challenge they face, David, is that quite frankly, the Fed's record at forecasting inflation has not been very good, including what I was there last year. And so I think it's going to be a balance between adjusting policy according to both the forecasters and the incoming data. Richard, it's not just the rates that are going on. We also have so-called quantitative tightening as you try to run down the balance sheet, which had gone so far up. Give us your sense of what that is doing right now to financial conditions in the United States. Well, David, it is tightening conditions. Again, quantitative tightening is reversing quantitative easing. So the Fed's balance sheet is shrinking. Now, it's been very well telegraphed. And so markets certainly understand the pace and the modalities of tightening. But it is serving to tighten financial conditions. And that's consistent with what the Fed wants to do in terms of raising rates. So Richard, that takes us to a subject that I know you've heard a lot about. We read about all the time, which is perhaps a problem with liquidity in the treasury market. There's more of volatility in the treasury market, as I understand it, but that's inherent in raising rates. The question is, is there additional volatility because there's not as much liquidity? We hear at least anecdotally that some people are having difficulty buying and selling large lots of treasuries. Yeah. Well, it's true. I went back and looked. I had the privilege of 20 years ago of serving as assistant treasury secretary in 01 or 02. And in those years, debt outstanding was about $3 trillion, about 30% of GDP. This year, it's $23 trillion or 100% of GDP. So quite simply, the amount of debt outstanding and the amount of treasury issuance is vastly larger than it was 10 or 15 years ago. And the plumbing of the intermediation system for treasury says not real expanded concomitantly with that. And so as a result, there is evidence on occasion of ill liquidity in the market, certainly in extreme cases, as we observed in March of 2020 or September 2019, it becomes even more evident. And so I think policymakers at the Fed and the treasury and other agencies are looking at ways in which treasury market functioning can be improved. And I think it's certainly something that should be studied and improved. And what are possible options if they do conclude there's an issue there? One of the most supposed to be reversing and going back to quantitative easing, that's one way to do it. Another might be actually to ameliorating at least some of the restrictions in regulation proposed after the 2008 Great Financial Crisis, which really is an issue. Took a lot of the big banks, and limited their participation in the market. Well, it's right. And so I think that one of the things, David, that we did in the spring of 2020 is that we did relax, something called the supplementary leverage ratio, in the sense that we would not count bank reserves or treasury holdings against that leverage ratio. The idea is we want to encourage banks to lend in the pandemic shutdown. And the Fed indicated when it left those exemptions, lapsed that it would begin, it would review whether or not it made sense to include treasuries and reserves in that leverage calculation. I'm sure that analysis is ongoing, but I think that's certainly something worth serious studying. What is the",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1215,2022-11-20 14:39:35
18602," to include treasuries and reserves in that leverage calculation. I'm sure that analysis is ongoing, but I think that's certainly something worth serious study. What is the rationale, actually, for the SLR? I don't not sure I understand it, because I would think the treasuries are as close to risk-free as possible. You know, the history of this is before the GFC, David, we had risk-based standards for banks, and so treasuries are not risky, other bonds are more risky. There was a sense broadly in the global community, not just in the U.S., but through the Basel process in Europe and Asia, central bank and policymakers agreed that it made sense to have a supplementary leverage for the very show. That typically would not be binding most of the time, but it could prevent, if you will, financial institutions from gaming an entirely risk-based system. However, you know, we discovered in March of 2020 the banks were in great shape. The banks were part of the solution, not part of the problem, and there can be perverse consequences of having a supplementary leverage ratio, especially when central banks are doing large amounts of key leak. Is the creating reserves, which the system has to absorb? So I think it's certainly something that could address, and I think it could make a lot of sense. Rich, thank you so much for being on Wall Street. We hope you'll come back often. It's really good to have you, Richard Claret of PIMCO. Coming up, we're going to wrap up the week with our special contributor Larry Summers of Harvard. I'm Wall Street Week on Bloomberg. It is crucial, and I think we've moved from this attitude from its indulgence a waste of time almost to nailness that needs a cure. For something as universally important to human life as sleep, mysteries surrounding its necessity and utility have only just been recently uncovered. Some of our biggest discoveries were in the 1970s or 1980s, and so it makes it a really exciting field, because it seems as though we're uncovering new insights each and every day. Some scientists are going further to find out how sleep and what happens there can be harness to further expand our understanding. It's easy to memorize things that makes you smart if you can spit back a lot of facts, but if you want to be wise, if you really want wisdom, you've got to know when and how and why to use that information. And that's what you bring, figures out where you're sleeping. This is Wall Street Week. I'm David Weston. Welcome back now. Our special contributor, Larry Summers of Harvard, to wrap up the week for us. Larry, thank you so much for being back with us. A lot of us spent a lot of the week actually trying to figure out where the Fed is headed, particularly where the terminal rate is. And we got conflicting, I think at least, somewhat conflicting answers out of the Fed, including with Mr. Bullard, the Fed president saying, well, five, five and a quarter, and then put up a chart using the Taylor Rule that suggested seven. Where are we? Look, no one knows. I think it's a mistake to be slavish about Taylor Rules. The market thinks the number is going to be about five. I look at things and my sense is there's more room for that to be too low than there is for that to be too high.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1216,2022-11-20 14:43:54
18603," I'm going to be about five. I look at things and my senses, there's more room for that to be too low than there is for that to be too high. But it's pretty clear that we've had the big moves on this cycle and now we're going to be finishing that process off. My view is that there's more risk from stopping prematurely and not really curing inflation and setting the stage up for a re-acceleration of inflation after it comes down. I see that as a bigger risk than going too far because going too far would mean bringing inflation down below 2%. And that still seems to me like an awfully remote risk starting from where we are. But I think that the Fed has this in the right place when it says that they're going to move up somewhat more and they're going to take stock of the situation and see what the inflation data is saying and seeing what the inflation forecasts are saying when we get to the spring of next fall, winter rather spring of next year. I have to say that if they hadn't made as many mistakes as they did of excessive optimism about inflation, they probably have a little more room than they do to rely on forecasts that hadn't yet proved out that inflation was going to come down. Larry, you and I talk a lot about monetary policy, even fiscal stimulus and things, but geopolysics have also factored increasingly in some of the issues having to do with the economy. This week we had what is potentially, we don't know if it is, an important development in the meeting of President Xi of China and President Biden. What do you make of those discussions and even ongoing discussions because now we have the USTR, a madam tie actually meeting with her counterpart. What do you make of the situation with China right now in the United States? Look, as Churchill famously said, George Law is a lot better than BangBang. And so the fact that they had a meaningful conversation that lasted more than three hours, the fact that they both came out of the conversation with the sense that there had been satisfying dialogue, the sense that there are some follow-on steps. I think that's all to the good. What it's really going to mean, what really is going to happen, is there going to be constructive movement out of those dialogues? I think that's something we're going to have to wait and see. But I'm encouraged by what I saw. And I think it means that President Biden's whole trip has to be regarded as a success. The United States back in the game with respect to climate in Shammel Shake, the meeting with Xi. I don't think this G20 will be long remembered, but at a very vexing moment, there could have been some kind of breakdown, and there certainly was not that. As a minimal thing, I've read some places, people say, at least there is a G20. I mean, they came out with a joint community, and it was fairly tough on Russia, I think it's fair to say. And the reporting behind the scenes are, is that some of the developing countries like Indonesia and India helped drive that process, which might, I don't want to overread it, suggest that maybe we're taking a half step back toward multilateralism? I think things, I think we are. I think that what Russia has done has really shocked the conscience of the world, and has affected very, very many countries. We'll have to see how this plays out. I think we need to remain aware that in the original vote in the UN General Assembly, there were countries with more than half of the world's population who abstained onto the Russia side, who declined to join in condemning.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1217,2022-11-20 14:48:15
18604," More than half of the world's population who have stained onto Russia's side, who declined to join in condemning Russia. So I think we've got a lot of work to do, and we in the United States tend to be a bit over optimistic about the extent to which all others see us as the, in the benign way that we see ourselves. It's such an important point, and it takes me back at least a China, because it seems to me that sometimes we've been overly optimistic, I mean, for example, going back to the time we admitted into the WTO, we thought China was going to become more like us, and then we go over the other extreme of being perhaps overly pessimistic about China. I guess my question for you is former treasury sector among other things. How do we play both sides of that? We don't know how it will end up. How do we keep open the realistic possibility we can really work closely with China, but also protect ourselves against the possibility of confrontation? We in the United States probably need to be careful about our evangelizing influence. I don't think it's really for us to tell China how they should organize their entire society. I think it's for us to stand up for some of our fundamental interests in security, in fair economic competition. But to leave it at that point, I think we're going to need to be very careful with respect to our diplomacy on the issue of Taiwan. I think we need to be very careful about giving China the sense that we are trying to change the traditional one China policy, because I think that could risk disastrous conflict. So I think the operative words for us need to be respect for them, respect for positions in the fundamental interests that they have. And at same time, absolute insistence on our own. And I would say one other thing, David, I think ultimately we will prevail in this broad contest with China. But I think if and when we prevail, it is going to be more than anything else on the strength of our example. And that's why domestic renewal at home, whether the issue is scientific innovation or infrastructure, whether the issue is doing something about opiate deaths or whether the issue is strengthening our education system, whether the issue is building on the greatness of our universities or the greatness of our national parks. And ultimately, it's going to be our ability to remain the country that's the envy of the world, the country to which people want to come that is going to determine our success. And if we change our focus from building ourselves up to tearing China down, I think we will be making a very risky and very unfortunate choice. Larry, I want to make a very large turn here. I've had the benefit of talking to you about the masters, about basketball, I want to talk to about Taylor Swift. She's a rather popular pop music star and ticket master because we now know the Department of Justice is investigating possible antitrust problems there because of ticket master, which does after I'll have like a 70% market share that's been under investigation for some time. I don't know if you know much about Taylor Swift, although I am concerned about you getting tickets, which apparently seems to be difficult. But more broadly, what is it say perhaps about some of the problems with over concentration in the economy? You know, I want to say two things about that, David. The first is that if the government made a website that functioned as badly as ticket masters has here, everybody would be laughing and scorning the government. And so the next time the private sector says that, you know, the public sector can't do anything right. This was a private sector building a website, sort of like that to build a website for a bomb.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1218,2022-11-20 14:52:31

This was a private sector building a website, sort of like that, to build a website for Obamacare, sort of like they have to build websites at the IRS, or like they have to build a build websites for student loan debt relief. And the private sector utterly failed. And that's something that we just have to remember. The next time somebody wants to say everything about government is hopeless. Yeah, we are humble. We're going to have to leave it there. I'm so sorry. We're humble. We have much to be humble about. Larry, thank you so very much. It's Larry. Some of us are a very special contributor here on Wall Street Week. Coming up, a lot of people get hurt when there's a collapse like that of FTX. But who stands to benefit? That's next on Wall Street Week on Bloomberg. I'm going to have to leave it there. I think the market that over the past few weeks has made it clear it wants to go higher. It got a little spooked by the idea that geopold will potentially rise in. You will shed light on dark matter. You will make aging optional. You will turn 5G up to 11. Because when you subscribe to Bloomberg, you won't just get news. You'll get insight into limitless possibilities, knowledge, and inspiration to feed your ambition. So before you invent pioneer, disrupt, before you change the world, Bloomberg. Finally, one more thought. If Tom Brady's for it, it's got to be good, right? I'm getting into crypto. With FTX, you win. Despite that endorsement from the greatest quarterback of all time, the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX has brought heartbreak to a lot of people. Wiping out in one fell swoop, what was estimated to be a $32 billion empire, leaving what its lawyers now say could be as many as a million creditors holding the bag. And by the way, triggering a class action lawsuit against Tom Brady and others paid to tout FTX to the world. The ripple effects of the collapse of FTX and the rest of the Sam Bankman-Fried's empire now beginning here as we wait for bankruptcy proceedings. All of which has shaken the confidence of many investors. That's according to Citadel's Ken Griffin. FTX is one of these absolute travesties in the history of financial markets. People are going to lose billions of dollars. And that undermines trust in all financial markets. But as bad as the FTX collapse may be, it's only the latest in a series of major meltdowns we've seen in recent years. Just think back to 2001, when that mythical energy giant Enron hit the skids, its former CEO Jeff Skilling reflected back on the loss in his later testimony before Congress. I am devastated by an apologetic about what Enron has come to represent. No words can make things right. Too many people have been hurt too much. Or World Cup. The telecommunications phenom of the late 90s that followed Enron into bankruptcy in 2002, wiping out a market cap of $186 billion and sending its former CEO Bernie Evers to prison, despite his trying to seek protection behind the Fifth Amendment.

18606," Former CEO Bernie Evers to prison, despite his trying to seek protection behind the Fifth Amendment. I've been instructed by my counsel not to testify based on my Fifth Amendment constitutional rights. Or that emblem of the first internet bubble, pets.com with that cute sock puppet mascot, which was an instant market hit when it went public, and just as quickly went flop. What goes up must come down. Some of these notorious failures shared a bold vision, a confident leader, and a belief that they'd come up with a better mouse trap, just like Mr. Bankman freed. And if FTX follows the pattern, it will share one other thing with colossal failures through the years. A lot of lawyers making a lot of money despite all the carnage. When Enron went into bankruptcy, it had assets of over $65 billion. And the ultimate resolutions shareholders were wiped out at a loss of $74 billion. But the lawyers, they walked away with over $1 billion along with the accounts. WorldCom was three times as big, losing investors in estimated $175 billion, while the lawyers were making over $10 million a month in a proceeding to last it well over a year. And the moment it was forced into bankruptcy, it made one of the most turbulent periods in our economic history, which culminated in a catastrophic crisis of confidence and a run on the bank. But those were all small potatoes compared with Lehman, a bankruptcy that wiped out between $46 billion and $63 billion according to the New York Fed. And netted the lawyers and other consultants a cool get this $6 billion. So we'll see how much the FTX creditors end up writing off, much less the token holders. As much pain as they're feeling though, you can be sure that there's one group that will come out okay. It's always the lawyers. That does it for this episode of Wall Street Week. I'm David Weston.

So let me get right to the heart of Ukraine if I could ask you. Is there any chance of a resolution in Ukraine matter any time the foreseeable future, any possibility of a truce or some kind of agreement that you think could end this war in the next few months or so? You never say never. There's always a chance. And we've been clear from the beginning that we would support a diplomatic solution that vindicated Ukraine's right to sovereignty and territorial integrity. But the odds of it in the next few months, I think are quite low on China. The president of the United States has not met with Xi Jinping for COVID related reasons, but there isn't possibility they might meet in the upcoming G20 meeting. Do you have any plans to have a agreement or any kind of proposed settlements of any issues that are now ongoing between the two countries? Or is it just more or less a meet and greet with no advanced planning of any great consequence? Well, right now there's no meeting planned, but as you say they will both be in Bali, Indonesia for the G20 in November. And it would afford an opportunity for the two of them to sit down in person. Actually, despite the fact that they've spent a huge amount of time together when Joe Biden was vice president, they've not met in person since President Biden became president. And that's because Xi Jinping is basically not left China in two years due to COVID-19. So this would be their first real chance to sit face to face and talk through the full range of issues in the relationship. I wouldn't expect major agreements to come out of that, but if they do actually sit, and again, that hasn't been decided, I would expect that we would see some progress on some issues where the two countries' interests do align. As we talk today, it's becoming out that President Putin will be meeting with President Xi Jinping most likely somewhere in Europe. I'm not too long from now. Is that a surprise to you? And what do you think they're going to be talking about? Well, it's not a surprise. President Xi and President Putin have met frequently over the course of each of their tenure. And in fact, President Putin went to Beijing earlier this year and met in person with President Xi in February when they rolled out this new partnership between the two countries. So I think that they'll talk about the full range of issues in their relationship. But I would note two things. First, before President Xi goes to Uzbekistan to meet with President Putin on the sidelines of another summit, he's going to Kazakhstan. In Kazakhstan's a place where actually China and Russia compete for influence. So it's an indication that this is a relationship not without its complications. And then second, China has actually stood back from fully getting in behind the Russians when it comes to their war in Ukraine. We have not seen them provide large-scale support in terms of weapons or industrial-scale efforts to undermine Western sanctions. So from our perspective, this relationship is something that bears close watching, but again is not without its complications. As we talk, there are also reports that North Korea is selling weapons to Russia. Was that a surprise to the administration? Well, what it indicates, actually, is that Russia doesn't have a lot of options. It would be OK to just talk about these conflicts.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1221,2022-11-20 15:05:42
18608," Korea is selling weapons to Russia. Was that a surprise to the administration? Well, what it indicates, actually, is that Russia doesn't have a lot of options. It appears to be running short of its own munitions. It looks around the world and doesn't find a lot of countries willing to sell it munitions. So it has to look to states like Iran and North Korea to get ammunition and other forms of weaponry to be able to sustain its conflict in Ukraine. This is not, in our view, a demonstration of strength by Russia. Now, the negotiation with Iran to restore, if that's the right verb, the nuclear agreement is ongoing. It's been going going for quite some time. Do you see any resolution of that in the near future? I'm not in the coming days. The Iranians have come back with a set of counter-proposals, which we are still taking a look at. But it doesn't suggest that an agreement is imminent right away. That being said, we do believe that there still is a pathway to a compliance for compliance return to the JCPOA. We will continue to work on that with our partners, particularly our European partners. And if Iran is prepared to do its part to get back into the JCPOA, we stand ready to do so. And as we talk, the new Prime Minister of U.K. has been announced previously involved in foreign policy. Have you met her before? I have met her before. I've met her here in the White House right down the hall from where we are right now when she was foreign secretary. She's transitioned from being essentially their secretary state to being their Prime Minister. And actually, just yesterday, President Biden had the opportunity to have a long phone call with her just hours after she had assumed her new position. And do you expect any change in the U.K. U.S. policy as a result of her becoming Prime Minister? At a foundational level, no. This is a special relationship. The two of them reaffirmed their commitment to the strength and vitality of the U.S. U.K. alliance. And I think on all of the major issues, whether it's Russia or China or Iran, you'll see the same kind of deep consultation and engagement between the two countries that you've seen before, regardless of who's President, regardless of who's Prime Minister. So I don't expect that there will be any fundamental changes in the relationship. But, you know, there'll be issues that we have to work through, of course, as there always are. Now, as we talk, the UN General Assembly will be meeting not too long from now in New York, as it does every year. Do you think the UN has still a useful purpose in diplomacy? Because it doesn't seem to be able to solve any problems, ongoing war problems that we now see in U.S. Ukraine or Russia. What do you think is the UN's main purpose at this point? Well, the UN actually has proved its continued effectiveness in actually being able to bring about diplomatic agreements in very difficult circumstances. I'll give you just two examples from the past few months. First, on Russia, Ukraine, it was the UN Secretary-General Antonio Gutierrez, who played a central role in getting a deal between Russia and Ukraine for the export of grain from both Ukrainian ports and Russian ports in the Black Sea. That's helping the entire world with respect to lowering food prices and expanding access to foodstuffs at a critical moment. Second, it was a UN mediator working with our U.S. envoy, the Saudis, Emirates, and the Yemenis, who helped produce earlier this year a ceasefire in the war in Yemen, which had been the worst humanitarian catastrophe in the world. That ceasefire is now going on six months, the longest period of peace in seven years in Yemen, and the UN played a key role in that. So it is not without its difficulties and complications. It is a big bureaucracy in need of constant reform, but the UN is still there on key issues in diplomacy, in delivering on global health, global food security, and other issues, and all of that will be on display in New York in two weeks. Now, recently, the President made a major speech on democracy. While the threat to American democracy is real, I want to say as clearly as we can, we are not powerless in the face of these threats. And in it, he talked about the values of democracy, which is large part of our foreign policy, which is to promote democracy around the world. Our events in the United States of the last year are so making it more difficult for the U.S. to say to other countries, look at how wonderful our democracy has worked.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1222,2022-11-20 15:09:56
18609," which is to promote democracy around the world. Our events in the United States are the last year or so making it more difficult for the U.S. to say to other countries, looking how wonderful our democracy has worked and therefore you should be following some of the things we do. Well, it does require a degree of humility. I mean, the United States does need to acknowledge that we have our own difficulties and challenges within our own democracy, even as we tout and promote democratic institutions, rule of law, human rights around the world. But I think President Biden is actually a very good messenger for that. Someone who can speak honestly and clearly to the American people about the strains in our democracy and then someone who can speak honestly and clearly to the world about how despite all of its imperfections, democracy remains the best form of government for delivering, for citizens and for promoting human dignity. Hydrogen has a very special place in the universe. It's the first element on the periodic table. It is the most abandoned element in the universe and when clean energy advocates think about what can we find which would be as easy to use as fossil fuels, they think about hydrogen. The fuel that will when burn only produce water. We like to imagine that if we just built enough of these and these, we could ditch fossil fuels and save the planet. Unfortunately, it's not that simple. There are some things we just need a good old-fashioned combustible fuel. Now startups around the world are betting that hydrogen can become the fuel of the 21st century. Let's talk a moment about your own background. You are not out there promoting your background. It's impressive and I just want to let people know about it a bit. You grew up in Minnesota. That's right. I guess you were a superstar in elementary school, junior high school, high school, your president of your class, president of student government. Is there anything you failed to do in high school that you wanted to do? Well, I didn't win all the cross-country races that I wanted to win, I guess. But you went to Yale. And Yale, you must have done reasonably well. You were elected as a road scholar and from Oxford, you later came back and went to Yale Law School and you were a top-editor there and became a Supreme Court clerk for Justice Breyer. So when you're having this career, do you ever think that you could make a mistake or your career could kind of go off the deep end or something because everything was working out perfectly? Well, it's true that I have had these incredible opportunities. But at every one of those stages, I went through the same fears and growing pains and slip-ups and stumbles that everybody did. And that was true with respect to academic work that was far from perfect. It was true with respect to relationships that didn't work out. And I had what I think was an incredibly lucky childhood in upbringing. But one that was not too different from the way a lot of other people who grew up in the Midwest in the 1980s and then got to have these chances. Your father and mother, what did they do? So my father worked on the business side of Minneapolis' start Tribune, which was the major newspaper in Minneapolis. My mother was a teacher and a guidance counselor in the Minneapolis Public Schools. And I'm one of five. I'm the second of five kids. And we all went to the Minneapolis Public Schools, graduated from Southwest High School. And your siblings, do they say, look, you're too good, you're a road scholar, you're Yale Law Journal, and everything, or there are no sibling rivalries? I mean, actually, I would say my sister is probably the most impressive among us. She's a pediatrician. She was a two sport division one athlete. And she's got five kids and is currently working at the Department of Health and Human Services on...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1223,2022-11-20 15:14:18
18610," She was a two sport division one athlete, and she's got five kids, and is currently working at the Department of Health and Human Services on COVID-19 and other pandemic responses. So I'm like kind of middle of the pack in terms of my siblings. So there was another person who was a Rhodes scholar went to Yale Law School, who became President of the United States Bill Clinton. So have you ever thought of running for office yourself? I used to think about it, but honestly, over the course of the years, I think my skills are better suited to public service and not elected format. And I'd rather help other people who I think would be better suited for actually running for office themselves. Talk for a moment about what it's like to be the national security advisor. The national security advisor office was set up, I think in the Eisenhower administration, more or less, though President Truman had a national security advisor as well. Your job is to get in early every day, make sure there's no crisis, or there is a crisis to tell the president, are you seeing the president early in the morning and briefing him, is that what you do as many have done before? Yes, so in the morning, we have something called the president's daily brief. That takes place in the Oval Office. And it's myself, my two deputies, and then the director of national intelligence who are there every day. And then we also bring in other cabinet members, depending on what the subjects are being briefed, so that the president gets exposure to his full national security team over the course of the week. And we talked to him about things that have developed overnight around the world. And we also talked to him about longer term trends that he expresses interest in and wants to stay on top of. So it's a mix of both the immediate term and the long term. And it gives him a full picture of the challenges and opportunities in the world for American folks. And then during a typical day, do you see him a couple other times and do you see him at the end of the day as well? Well, just to take yesterday as an example, in addition to the PDB, Secretary Blinken and I had the opportunity to just sit with him informally for a little while before the cabinet meeting. So we could talk through a kind of tick list of issues that had been building up over the course the last couple of weeks. And then later in the afternoon, we had this call with the British Prime Minister. And that involved some amount of time to talk through what he wanted to accomplish in that phone call, what we expected. She would say to him. And then I sat there with him while he did the phone call. So that would be a typical day, seeing the president two, three times. And then spending time with the other principles of the National Security Council, the cabinet secretary, secretary of defense, the secretary of the treasury, the secretary of state, and talking through the big decisions that we would need to tee up for the president to make on everything from global food security to Taiwan, to the Chips Act, the new law that's been passed to invest in advanced microchips here in the United States. We covered the waterfront. So sometimes presidents, I observe, lose their temper and they yell. His president Biden, that yell, everyone needs not happy, or he just calmly just says, here's what I think. He's not a yell. And he's somebody who is disciplined and direct and holds us to a high standard. And he will challenge us to make sure that we have nailed down the details of everything we are presenting to him. And if we haven't, he'll tell us, do better. But he does so in a totally respectful, straightforward way, the same way that everybody has seen him in public life. So when I work in the White House under President Carter, there were frequent disputes between the secretary of state, side-vants, and the national advisor is a big brazen ski. And it's a great tradition, it seems, in our government, that the secretary of state, the national advisor, always sparring one where they are leaking to the press. In this administration, I haven't seen a lot of leaks from your office or the secretary's office criticizing the other person's office. So how have you avoided that problem? Well, a lot of it has to do with just deep mutual respect and straight-up friendship between myself and the secretary of state. Tony and I have known each other for years. We're good friends, our families are friends. That doesn't mean that there aren't debates. We don't have disputes because we have an open operating style. I think we both try to be nice people. But we do have debates. We disagree on certain issues. And the thing that I take very seriously is my responsibility to run a process that is open, humane, fair.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1224,2022-11-20 15:18:42
18611," But we do have debates. We disagree on certain issues. And the thing that I take very seriously is my responsibility to run a process that is open, humane, fair, transparent, and above board. And I try to do that so that his perspective, the Secretary of Defense's perspective, the Attorney General's perspective, depending on the issue, are all teed up to the president in a way in which they get their say. And then we work it out. And that has, in my view, worked quite effectively over the course of the past 19 months. And I consider it one of the central responsibilities of my position to ensure that that process is fair and effective. In hindsight, which is always 2020, is there anything the administration could have done to prevent Putin from invading? Six months into this invasion, I'm fairly well convinced that Putin was going to do this no matter what. While Tesla's in the like make for good headlines, the reality is that even if every car on the roads today went electric, it wouldn't be enough to curb global emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions from transportation account for about 29% of total US greenhouse gas emissions. So what about the other 71%? Buildings across America burn fossil fuels to operate. What we want to do is make that all electric. Instead of burning oil and gas to give us the energy and electricity we need, we want to do 100% clean energy, all electric. We want to turn buildings into Tesla's. Just like a Tesla or an electric vehicle is all electric with no fossil fuels, we want to do that with our buildings. If we can do it in one building, we can do it in all buildings. And if we do it in all buildings, we'll reduce 30% of US greenhouse gas emissions. Japan's critical role in the global economy is changing as the world recalibrates. After decades of stagnation, Japan's leaders are forging a more innovative and sustainable path forward to revitalize the nation. Corporate giants, policymakers and pioneers tell us how they're doing just that. Every week on Japan ahead, right here on Bloomberg Television. Welcome to the world of decentralized finance, Bloomberg's covering all things crypto, the people, the transactions and the technology Bloomberg crypto Tuesdays. Every Friday with 30 minutes dedicated to fixed income, I'm Jonathan Farrow this is with Buck Roe-Yout. Let's go around the world for a couple of trouble spots. North Korea, any progress on getting them to give up their nuclear testing or is that difficult to do? It's difficult, obviously, through multiple presidents going back to the Clinton administration. The North Koreans have continued to move forward with their nuclear weapons program. In the course of the past year, they have conducted a number of long-range missile tests. We have been warning about the possibility of a seventh nuclear test, test of a nuclear weapon. And we still think that that is something that is likely to happen in the coming months. We have also indicated to the North Koreans that we are prepared to sit down in a serious way to conduct diplomacy, to on a step-by-step basis work towards the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. So far, the North Koreans have been so interested in that. China and Taiwan, there's been a lot of rhetoric from the U.S. side, a lot of rhetoric from the Chinese side. Fision, any real problem occurring where the Chinese might actually invade Taiwan? I think it remains a distinct threat that there could be a military contingency around Taiwan. And the People's Republic of China has actually stated as official policy that it is not taking the invasion of Taiwan off the table, that that remains one of the potential options for the reunification of Taiwan. Their position has been changing over time, in terms of their disturbance of the status quo across the Taiwan street. Action.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1225,2022-11-20 15:22:57
18612," in terms of their disturbance of the status quo across the Taiwan Strait, actions that they are taking with their military to undermine peace and stability. The American position has remained steadfast and consistent. One China policy, Taiwan Relations Act, three joint communiqués that we agreed with China back in the 1970s and 80s that laid out that from our perspective, there should be no unilateral changes to the status quo across the Taiwan Strait. We continue to believe that and we will continue to push back against any effort to change the status quo by force. Now, there is legislation now moving forward through Congress to kind of toughen up the existing support the US has for Taiwan. Is administration adopted a position on that legislation yet? Well, I'm actually going to have the opportunity later today, literally later today to go up to the hill to talk to some members about this legislation. I prefer to have the opportunity to lay it out for them before I lay it out on TV. But I will just say this, there are elements of that legislation with respect to how we can strengthen our security assistance for Taiwan that are quite effective and robust that will improve Taiwan's security. There are other elements that give us some concern. Let's go back to Ukraine for a moment in hindsight, which is always 2020. Is there anything the administration could have done to prevent Putin from invading or told the allies more forcefully that this invasion was going to occur to convince them because it seemed as if they didn't really believe what was going to happen. What would you have done or would you think you should have done in hindsight? If anything, differently than you did. Given that we're still in the middle of this unfolding crisis, it's hard to get the kind of level of perspective to look back and say, hey, maybe we could have done this instead of that. There's always something you could improve upon. I would never say no, no, no, no, we did everything absolutely perfectly. But six months into this invasion, I'm fairly well convinced that Putin was going to do this no matter what, that he considered this central to his legacy as President of Russia. And he was not going to be knocked off course. The only thing that was going to stop him was the physical might of the Ukrainian forces holding back his ability to take Kiev and take other major cities backed by the weapons that we provided them. That was the strategy we executed. I think we executed it well. And I think Ukraine is in a position now today to ensure that they will remain a strong sovereign viable independent state, even as they continue to try to resist Russian aggression on a portion of their territory. In terms of the allies, you know, we took unprecedented measures, quite novel measures to declassify information, to make presentations both to our allies and to the international community. And I think over time that actually did build a sense of unity that continues to this day. An allied unity, transatlantic unity has been a huge thorn on the side for Vladimir Putin, as he's tried to, to break that and tried to produce a weaker, less cohesipanado when in fact, what he's gotten is the exact opposite. So what you're referring to, I think, is that to my surprise when I was reading The New York Times about this was going on, information that seemed like it was vital information was declassified. And in fact, given to the press about the troop movements of the Russians, was that a complicated decision to come to controversial within the administration to say we're going to declassify and leak our best intelligence about what the Russians are doing? It definitely took a whole process of us thinking about all of the risks and benefits of doing that, especially since it was uncharted territory. And that involved me sitting with our intelligence professionals, our diplomats, and ultimately with the president to bless a strategy that would involve the systematic declassification of information so that no one would be surprised and so that Russia could not try to generate pretext for what it was doing. And I think it turned out to be an effective method of putting Russia on the back foot, putting the Western Alliance on the front foot and giving us the opportunity to build a coalition that is currently supporting Ukraine. So as I said earlier, hindsight's always 2020. In hindsight, would you have exited Afghanistan differently than the way you did it? Well, at the end of the day, any time you have a circumstance where you're ending a 20 year war with 20 years of decisions and mistakes that have piled up through multiple administrations, the exit would not be easy. There was no clean easy exit. And I think this.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1226,2022-11-20 15:27:24
18613," With 20 years of decisions and mistakes that have piled up through multiple administrations, the exit would not be easy. There was no clean, easy exit. And I think the strategic decision to go to end that war after 20 years was absolutely the correct decision. Where there are things that we could have done differently, I think the answer to that is always yes. And there will be time as I end up looking back and reflecting on that period to pinpoint what some of those might have been. But from my perspective, the underlying decision to end the war in Afghanistan, which the president took, I think in a quite courageous way, was the correct decision. And one year later, to me, it is the time that has passed is only reinforced the correctness of that decision. Many people hell your job. Have a burnout after a few years. You look like you're in good shape, and you're young. You're the second youngest person to ever have this job. So you anticipate doing this for an entire four-year period of this first term, if it's another term, let's say this four-year period of time. Well, I serve at the pleasure of the president, but I feel passionate about the work that I'm doing. I feel blessed to be part of this team. I feel blessed to be able to serve President Biden. I'd like to keep doing it. At some point you had to fight for the trademark right for the Red Salt. Is that stressful? Very stressful. Especially, we are a small company in a way, and you have to fight people who have those huge companies who put you 27 lawyers on your back for something which is very stressful. I wish it didn't happen. Everything which happened to me is less than in a way bad or good. Once it's done, it's done, and I'm sort of happy about it. It's that thing I could have definitely avoided, but it's done. Did you realize at the time when you started the company that you would become so successful? I'm actually so big. No, no. When I started the company, I wanted to have a shop in Paris, which is my hometown, and I wanted to do pretty shoes for pretty girls. That was my goal. Now you look back and you say, actually, I still make pretty shoes, but for many more women. Yeah, absolutely. Do you think you would have been so successful without the Red Salt? I think the Red Salt definitely, of course, participates to my work, but also to the fame of my shoes, because it's instantly recognizable. But then, you know, the design is very important, but definitely when you have such a strong sign of recognition, it participates to, yeah. No one covers the world like Bloomberg.

No, I don't think so, but I think it's like anytime that frankly it's when a lot of other people get into crypto right other audiences too it's when it's in the news a lot and when does that happen a lot of times when the prices are going up. She was a federal prosecutor going after gangs and the mob before being handed for next assignment. Taking down Bitcoin. Katie Han soon realized this new technology was much more than a tool used by criminals. She dove deep and became a crypto convert swapping her prosecutor hat for a board seat at Coinbase making the first female general partner at venture firm and recent horror wits. Han, now a prolific crypto investor recently launched her own fund with one and a half billion dollars to deploy. It's the largest fund ever raised by a single investor. Joining me on this edition of Bloomberg Studio 1.0 CEO and founder of Han Ventures, Katie Han. Katie, it's so great to have you. Great to be back here in the studio with you Emily. I want to start with a vibe check. Okay. What state of the crypto cycle are we in right now? It was hot. Yep. And then it got pretty cold. Well look Emily zooming back because I've been in crypto for a decade if you can believe it. We've seen crypto be really hot and then all of a sudden not. And so we've seen this before. However, I think one of the things that's a little bit different now is with each new crypto cycle more and more people come into it. And so it's more and more pronounced each cycle. And I would push back on it's not. I think it depends on what area of the ecosystem you're looking at. We think developers think crypto and Web3 is still really hot. I am seeing a lot less of those we're all going to make it hashtags. I'm seeing a lot less of them too. Although I am spending less time on Twitter so maybe that's why as well. But with each cycle there are new acronyms. What hasn't happened is a crypto winter in the midst of kind of really serious global macro conditions. So we have inflation kind of at record highs for our generation in our lifetime. And then we have also a war that's broken out in the Ukraine. And we have a number of other factors going on here. So that's very different. There was some serious carnage out there. Socius, Luna, three hours. What's been your takeaways from? I don't want to sit here and tell you that algorithmic stablecoins are bad because I actually think they're really interesting. However, I think what happened is you had in this case you mentioned Luna and Tara, you know, that was an algorithmic stablecoin that was getting pretty widespread adoption relative to what the tech could do. I didn't realize you spent your teenage years living in Egypt and learning Arabic. Tell me about your upbringing. I was always uprooted. My dad worked for a large company and we were always moving just when I would get comfortable in one space. And I think actually that's pretty important. If you fast-forward and look at my career, I'm comfortable being in uncomfortable situations. I didn't know a lot about venture when I got into it initially. I didn't know a lot about crypto when I got into it initially. And I was okay asking questions. I was okay not knowing the local acronyms or the Naman creature of a particular field. And I'm taken right back to my teenage years in Cairo, moving from Houston, Texas one day to downtown Madi in Cairo the next day. You studied law. I did. You clerked for Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy. That's right. You became a federal prosecutor. You were taking on prison gangs and the mafia. That must have taken a really thick skin. I was doing it at each 25. And now if I kind of take a step back in you, I think that happens at different points in your career. Like, whoa, if I would have analyzed that a little more at the time. And I'm kind of in some ways glad I didn't. I just dove right in because I felt fascinating. There was a human aspect to it. And people's stories. And I felt like those stories mattered. So I was drawn to criminal law and became a federal prosecutor. And I did cases involving violent crime. But then really mistriing case.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1228,2022-11-20 15:36:09
18615," I felt like those stories mattered. So I was drawn to a criminal law and became a federal prosecutor and I did cases involving violent crime, but then really mistrying cases, being back in the courtroom, being before the grand jury. Like the prosecutor you would see on TV, going to try those murder cases. Doing those two-hour closing arguments. That's right. And so moved out here to California. I died at the largest prison gang in the world at the time. Outlaw motorcycle gangs, hostage taking, bank robberies, armed bank robberies. There was really not a kind of criminal case by that point in my career. I hadn't done it. It was right around that time. 2012. One of my bosses came in and said, let's have that same energy that you brought to those gang cases, to those murder cases. And let's go ahead and have you investigate this new criminal technology that we really need to look into and possibly shut this down. So you created the first cryptocurrency task force. How would you describe it? Fortunately, several of us in the government realized at the time, it's not possible, also not desirable, because Bitcoin is not an entity. It's not a person. Right, it's a protocol. And it would be like saying, let's go shut down cash. Let's go shut down the internet. It's not possible. Probably wouldn't be a good idea, either. I was using crypto and technologies like the Bitcoin blockchain, because that's all that existed. Then this is 2012, 2013, to actually uncover criminal activity. So I didn't think that that technology was bad. Frankly, it was a tool that helped me uncover the various activity. And by the way, it was a step-level function improvement better than compliance by banks. I'll just go ahead and say it. That's a little bit controversial. But I had spent a decade subpoenaing large financial institutions and five times out of 10 didn't get back what I needed. One case I worked on, and people always say, oh, you shut down the Silk Road. What actually happened? I was looking into something completely, not having to do with anything at all of the Silk Road and came across some, what looked to be some kind of odd activity. And it turns out that a couple of federal agents on the Silk Road Task Force out of Washington, DC were croaked. And that is the case that I ended up in dining and I ended up prosecuting those agents, and they both went to prison. So that's the aspect of what the Silk Road case that I worked on. I would never, never have been able to uncover that criminal activity by those agents because they were federal agents, they knew how to cover their tracks. Had they not used Bitcoin blockchain. Right? So that technology right there, if they had just used wires or cash or bank wires, we would never have uncovered that. Just how hard is it to launch a crypto fund from scratch? You've got to explain this one to me. What does it mean when the White House says we're watching markets carefully? It means they have a Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. They have been an insane it. Lots of Bloombergs. Lots of Bloombergs. Lots of Bloombergs. Lots of Bloombergs. Lots of Bloombergs. Lots of Bloombergs. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. What does it mean? What does it mean? What does it mean? What does it mean? What does it mean? It means they have a Bloomberg. So what's the best investment advice you've ever been given by anybody? The compound interest, the compounding of returns is an incredible miracle of business, finance, and human existence. Everything you learn is additive every day. And if you keep added and don't quit, it's an incredible miracle. And it's not just interest. It was always said about compound interest returns, compound business returns, compound human returns. They're all very additive because you learn every day. And if you keep added, it's very, very helpful. In your observation of investors, what do you think is the biggest mistake that average investors make selling at the wrong time? And they sell when the prices go down? Yes. Or not keeping people have conviction or they invest for the right reasons just keep added. So you became kind of a crypto-com.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1229,2022-11-20 15:40:28
18616," Just keep at it. [♪ OUTRO MUSIC PLAYING [♪ [♪ OUTRO MUSIC PLAYING [♪ So you became kind of a crypto convert after this. You joined the Board of Coinbase very early on. How did you and Coinbase and Brian Armstrong come together? I hosted an event here in San Francisco at the Federal Reserve Bank and believe it was there that it wasn't just Brian. It was a lot of what I'll call legitimate actors in crypto who wanted to usher in this new wave, this new ecosystem. And then we brought together the heads of all kinds of agencies. Really in an effort to kind of talk about building bridges. You know, the government and the crypto industry, we're never going to see eye to eye on a lot of things, but we did think there were some commonalities. Coinbase is a company that has suffered. They've been losing share. The valuation of the public markets has plummeted. Why do you think that is and how do you think it can be fixed? Yeah, well, I think again a few things it's tied to. One, a large aspect of Coinbase's business now, of course, is trading revenue. And that's down when prices are down. And you know, the company's been very transparent about that long before going public. I mean, also if you look at its S1, it specifically identifies that. And just how volatile crypto cycles are. So I think that's part of it. It's judged by public markets as a technology stock or as a financial services company. By the way, I think it's both. I think it's not just a financial services company. I think it's so much more. I think it's really a portal to this whole new ecosystem. You were also on the board of OpenC until recently there's an insider trading situation or accusation going on there. Coinbase has also had employees accused of insider trading. How much is this happening within crypto companies and within the industry and how big a problem is? Yeah, I think crypto is under the microscope. So where you have a case, two cases, three cases in crypto ecosystem, which now is a trillion dollar industry. I think multi-billion approaching trillion dollar industry, you're always going to be able to find examples like that. So I don't want to make too much out of a handful of cases. That said, the company, Coinbase, OpenC, take these things incredibly seriously. Along with your position at Coinbase, you became a partner at one of the most storied venture capital firms in Silicon Valley. That is Andrews and Harwitz. What was your experience at A16Z-like? There I met Chris Dixon and I met Ben Horwitz and I met Mark Andreessen. And I had worked with them for just about a year, maybe a little bit over when they asked me to come and co-run their crypto funds at Andreessen Harwitz. Again, I jumped at that chance and I think really that speaks to the fact that as I've said before, things are a hell yes or there are no. And it was a hell yes for me. So Andreessen Harwitz is the kind of place where if you make a partner, you don't leave. Yeah. How did Mark and Ben respond when you said, yeah. You want to leave to start a crypto fund of my own? As you might know, Emily, they're an anchor. They're an anchor check into my fund. And I'm very grateful for that. You know, Mark and Chris and folks like them are also personal LPs. So I felt very supported when I shared that decision. And I will say that it was not running away from Andreessen Harwitz. It was running to another opportunity. And you know, crypto is not, what did they say? It's not a spectator sport. It's like, you're in it. It excuse very young. It's 24-7. It's global. And it's hustle. And at this, and that's a trade-off. It's a life trade-off. And at this point in my career and in my life, if I was going to continue to make that trade-off, I just wanted to do it and do it in a way that was really true to me. So you struck out on your own? Yes. To launch on Ventures, what gave you the courage to do that? What was the spark that lit the fire? Yeah. That got you to say, I need to do this and do this now. Sure. What I set out to do was to continue to invest in this ecosystem that I think is so broad that decision was very purposeful. And the timing was very purposeful. We have an early stage fund that does seed stage, series A, even series B. And then we have what we call an acceleration fund, which is, it's not a growth fund. It's a crypto growth fund. And I think those are different things. But it's later stage. It might be crypto-publics. Certain kinds of public tokens were set up to hold tokens and participate in the token ecosystem. Or later stage companies. I mean, there are now several crypto, many crypto unicorns. Space has become really competitive. Even though you say, crypto has had its...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1230,2022-11-20 15:44:52
18617," Companies, I mean, you know, there are now several crypto, many crypto unicorns. Space has become really competitive. Even though you say, you know, crypto's had its kind of ups and downs. The thing is, a lot of people in some of those last cycles have seen the kind of venture style returns that can be had in crypto. And so you've had a lot of new funds enter the space. And that's driven up competition. So what differentiates on ventures then? From, you know, all of these other crypto funds or even more traditional venture capitalists like entries in Harowitz or Sequoia. They also have crypto funds now. Well, I think a lot of traditional venture capital funds now have crypto funds. It used to just be like a regulatory designation. It was like, are you an RIA, which is registered investment advisor? I would say for crypto founders today, it's not enough to just be an RIA, right? They, frankly, I don't even know if a lot of them care. That's a regulatory designation. What crypto founders today want to know is, do you live and breathe crypto? Do you inhale the discourse? Are you part of the community? Do you participate in governance? Are you going to be staking these kind of crypto verbs out there? And if you're not really in this space full time, I think it's very hard to run a successful crypto fund. We don't have a hedge fund component. So we're not sitting here buying and trading and selling. That's a hedge fund structure. And there are crypto hedge funds. We're not one. We're making seven to 10-year bets. Just how hard is it to launch a crypto fund from scratch? You know, it's hard, but it's not impossible. We don't have a crystal ball. I don't know. I can't predict cycles, but I knew that we were in a cycle where you saw so much further an excitement around the space. And I already talked about what makes this different. But I think one thing also is we are a nimble strike force. We don't fish in the same pond. We have the crypto natives. We have a fish and execution. We have operators, seasoned operators who really know how to stick the landing. And I think that's reflected in our culture. I would say the only thing that's changed in our strategy as a result of the market correction is really more of a focus on early stage, but we still have our late stage fund. And when we see valuations, which I think will still see correct, spoiler. I think we'll continue to see some corrections. And so we might deploy our later stage fund a little bit more slowly. It might not be on an even 50-50 cadence. And that's OK. Long-term, our strategy hasn't changed. Long-term, we're committed to this space. How much do you think valuations are going to correct? It's just, I can't give you a one-size-fits-all answer because crypto is not a monolith. You have some crypto companies that really follow more of an enterprise-sass business model. You have others that are layer one protocols. You have still others that are consumer-facing applications. And I think one of the things we're seeing right now is the infrastructure layer. And that's where we're spending a lot of our time, by the way. And we think more and more use cases will come about when the infrastructure layers in place. So my own view is we are not rushing to deploy. We're certainly not getting caught up. You can do get VC FOMO and have you not to avoid that. You know, look, I think it's very easy to get into that mindset, right? It's because it's a competitive sport. It's a competitive space. And I think I'd be lying if I said that that doesn't influence anyone. I try to, what I do, and I think I do differently, is I try to take stock of that. Oh, that's the FOMO mentality kicking in. That's bad. Again, you don't want to over-correct, though. What we look for is we look for amazing founders. It doesn't matter if I think valuations will correct if they're amazing founders. There's a huge tam. We also look for what's your regulatory plan? If you're launching a token, what's your plan to comply with the law? What's your plan for security, by the way? We've seen a lot of hacks in the space. We want to really dive in there and make sure that the founders have been thoughtful about, especially if they're custodian customer funds, keeping those funds secure. If it's a cross-chain bridge, what are the exploits? Have you changed your strategy at all, given the downturn? What? Have you backed out of any deals or decided not to do certain deals? Because the conditions have changed. Don't you raise the phone? We have decided not to do certain deals. We've never backed out of a deal. We have decided not to do a few deals. Because? Because we think that pricing was ahead of progress, candidly. And we might have been wrong about that, Emily. We might have been wrong about that. But I think if we were wrong not to do a couple of deals, better that we might have been right. Because if we were wrong about that, I think we can find a way to still invest in those projects later. But one thing I'm hearing is that a lot of dry powder has just...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1231,2022-11-20 15:49:12
18618," We might have been right, because if we were wrong about that, I think we can find a way to still invest in those projects later. Well, one thing I'm hearing is that a lot of dry powder has just sucked up, because all these funds raised a lot of money raised. What was the biggest fund ever for a single person, not just a woman? Yeah. Anyone? Yep. Are you confident you're going to have a place to put all that money? I am, but if I don't have a place to put it, I'm not just going to go willing, nearly deploy it. One of the things that we told our LPs even during the period when we raised our fund, which was when crypto was undeniably still on a bull run, we said that we are going to be pretty steadfast, sticking to a tier deployment cycle. And I think one thing that's changed is that might have lengthened. It certainly hasn't shortened, but we will, again, we feel very good that we have the capital to back great teams when we see them. So you think we're going to fall behind the United States? I think we already are falling behind. Fall behind. We're falling behind. What do you want to know today? Ask a question or visit Search Go to find answers now. Watch Bloomberg surveillance early edition for the news you need when you need it. One more. vibration. It is time when everybody else is facing a very different Be informed, be prepared, be ahead of the game. What about NFTs? And if you are concerned about the declining demand? We are going to increasingly live in a digital world. And I happen to think that if you live in a digital world, you're going to want to own digital goods in that world. You're not just going to be satisfied to rent them, which is what we do now. We buy our content from walled gardens without digital scarcity, which is what NFTs unlock. You don't really own anything. You're subject to the whims of a platform. And I think NFTs and digitally scarce goods fundamentally change that. I think you'll see NFTs back again. But we are spending a lot of time in the infrastructure layer. Like I tell you, zero knowledge, technology, scalability. We think of that as like the plumbing. If you think of the fiber-hubtic cables. Remember, you couldn't have had YouTube and Netflix with dial-up. You couldn't have streamed content. The same is true of crypto use cases. We think that there will be a lot of new use cases unlocked when the infrastructure is there, when it's more efficient, when it's more user-friendly. And so we're spending a lot of our time there. President Biden issues this crypto executive order. There are a number of ports that are coming due. What do you want to see from the administration when it comes to regulation? Are you optimistic that we will get there? Yeah. We were so delighted to see that executive order. This is not something you should normally be delighted about. But why we were is because it was to us a real recognition that this is a US government saying this field isn't going anywhere. This field is growing. It's growing so much that we are going to direct every single agency in the federal government to come up with a plan here. I think we take a step forward, but then you see we're a big government. We're a big system. We have states. We have local entities. So we take a step forward with the EO. And then we take some steps back sometimes too. And I think what I see as crypto founders are confused by that. They're starting to think, well, I could go to this jurisdiction where there's a single regulator. And you don't have 50 states with different rules. It's the US government that needs to start taking stock of the fact that right now, Emily in China, there's a quarter of a billion ECNY wallets.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1232,2022-11-20 15:53:35
18619," It's the U.S. government that needs to start taking stock of the fact that right now, Emily in China, there's a quarter of a billion, ECNY wallets, a quarter of a billion. We're still talking about whether there should be a government central bank digital currency. We're still studying that. So you think we're going to fall behind the United States? I think we already are falling behind. Fall behind China. I mean, we're falling behind. What are the dangers of falling behind China and the rest of the world? This is years ahead. I don't want people to take a headline and say, oh, I think the U.S. dollar will be no longer than global currency, reserve global currency. I'm not saying that now. But fast forward decades. If you no longer need to use the dollar because you have an alternative, I think that's a real problem. What would we use instead? Well, I think that there are going to be stable coins out there that people who have access to a smartphone will use. There is a demand for it. You see, 285% year-over-year growth is stable coins. So people are clearly liking the idea of this. Now, again, there have been some spectacular failures, too, but not all stable coins are created the same. But I think the important thing is that we really do need to not just quash innovation. What do you think of how Gary Gensler, the chair of the SEC, and how he's approaching it? One of the things that I hear from founders is that they're very confused because they get told, come in, register, just come in and talk to us. But you have the one company who's done the ultimate act of going in and registering coinbase, file the S1. And still, there's a lot of saber rattling still going on, I think. And again, I don't want to single out the SEC. And I don't want to suggest that anything they're doing is bad. I do think, though, that right now there's a lot of confusion. And one of the pieces of confusion stems from the fact that it started with the ICO Lenia back in 2016, 2017. I can't remember which year now, where the SEC was very loud about securities. A lot of them were securities, but the space has changed. And so to still view it through the ICO lens when so much has happened over the last five years in the space, I think is a mistake. What do you have to say to the skeptics out there who just don't believe in the future of Web 3? And don't see where this is going. I would say don't judge the current state of innovation by the end state of innovation. I hear from a lot of these skeptics. And by the way, I'm friends with a lot of these skeptics, too. I don't only want to live in a crypto bubble. They want to see the use cases, especially if they're not technical. Well, when am I going to use it? What will I use it for? And I think one of the things that's not appreciated is how quickly the infrastructure here is catching up. And once you have really scalable blockchains that can handle a lot of thorough put and are very efficient, I think that unlocks a whole lot of use cases. People are spending more time on screens. That curve is up and to the right. Whether we like it or not, that is the future. I mean, those who have kids know that kids spend more time online. They want digital things, too. And I think to dismiss it, it is a bit generational. I do find not always, but it is a bit generational. If you talk to kids about being able to have money online, they instantly get that concept. They're comfortable not having to hold something in their hand to think it has value. Take us to the end state. Do Google and Amazon and Facebook and Apple still exist? I believe they will still exist. I mean, it depends what you talk about when you talk about the end state. I mean, I think that, you know, I think for decades, those companies will still be around. But the important thing is I think this new ecosystem is going to represent a challenge to them. I think that those entities, decentralized forces are coming and will cut into those entities, profits and revenues. So we have a little rapid fire section. If you could belong to any altcoin tribe, that's what it be. Gosh. There is no way I'm answering that because I will get trolls on Twitter by every other altcoin tribe. I'm a crypto-maximalist.

18621," and investment banking. So what are the challenges that lie ahead and where does he see opportunities? Will barclays have to increase provisions for loan losses as a cost of living crisis gets worse? Over the next 30 minutes we talk strategy, investment banking in Europe, the future of the city of London, and how inflation will change the banking world, with the man who's in charge of barclays for the lost 12 months. VanCat, thank you so much for speaking to Bloomberg. So 12 months into the job, what have you learnt about yourself and the bank? The last 12 months have been a wonderfully educational experience. About myself I've learnt how much more I needed to learn about banking, including running a large organisation, finding ways to encapsulate what our ambitions are and to convey and get to so many people and then visiting all the people's football footprint of the bank we have. It's also, you know, it's been a wonderful year in terms of the bank's operational performance. We've managed a bunch of crises and we've managed them relatively well I think, but if the start we are in a middle of a tough economic environment. So in terms of strategy, the strategy hasn't changed that much from your predecessor. Is it about execution or is it a different lens that you're looking at it with? So I was part of the team that set up the strategy seven years ago and our strategy then was to simplify our footprint, focus on building a global investment bank that was, you know, very highly competitive. We are now number six with the biggest European investment bank. It was about doubling down on the UK where we want to be a leading financial institution in sort of everything, retail and wholesale. And it is about building up a very specialised consumer business in the US, which we've done. We like the footprint, the businesses are operating well. I think now it is the striving to excellence, which is to make sure that in all the businesses which we do clients and customers know what we are about, we do the things that we do very well. We don't have hobbies, we are very focused, we execute well and it's about excellence. But can you really compete with the US bank in terms of having an investment bank? Can Europe have that leverage or are you always going to be one step below? So we are competing. We are number six. We've been gaining market share and share revenue share in our markets business for many years. And, you know, we are under no illusion that we are not going to catapult, no do we want to catapult a number three or number two. But we can be very good at what we do. And if we are good, people will transact with us and work with us. And you can make a very good living at the size we are. Do you want to get bigger? Is now, if you look at the pipelines and things that are coming through, is now the right time to employ more bankers? Two slightly different questions about getting bigger. One is I think that as long as we do well and organically we grow, that's fine. I wouldn't want to take large steps. But if it happens in an accumulation over a period of time, that's welcome because it's gradual. About bankers, I think it's a question more about what sectors of banking? We've made a big push in sustainability and we continue to expect to do that. And obviously, you know, pulling out of some old economy sectors are reducing it not to zero. But there is a shift in the banking wallet and we respond to that. And I think sustainability is very important. Are you expecting more IPOs, more pipelines? You mentioned the environment that's a little bit uncertain at the moment. What does the next 12 months look like? I think it is going to be a difficult environment for the first six to nine months of that 12. I hope by the summer when people are able to sort of see the end of the rate rising cycle. It may not have happened by the summer, but hopefully you can forecast the end of it with reasonable confidence. Then businesses will feel more confident themselves in what they want to do about their capital raising and capital planning. But I think it will do a little time before we see that clarity. What's your biggest concern out there on the markets? I know you had some good results. A lot of it has to do with also how you traded your traders perform very well. But we have a very uncertain environment. We don't know what inflation looks like, the cost of living. You have exposure to mortgage. There's leverage out there. What keeps you up at night? Well, I think what?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1235,2022-11-20 16:06:23
18622," We don't know what inflation looks like, the cost of living, you have exposure to mortgage. There's leverage out there. What keeps you up at night? Well, I think what we've had this year is a series of incidents which would have been difficult to forecast at the start of the year. Even at the start of the year, I think across the industry people were cautious because they knew we were at the start of a raiding cycle. It's never good for credit assets in those periods. It's not good for equity assets generally in that period. Then you had the Russia Ukraine War and then here in the UK you had that little volatility with GILTS and LDI. So there are pockets where there could be leverage and there are pockets where there may be rapid movements. And in this kind of a raiding cycle, you would expect to see that happen. So it's rather than being specific worries about certain things, it's being generally aware that you're driving a car when it's rainy and the roads may be slippery. So what does that mean in terms of risk management? What does that mean in terms of you preempting some of the things that could go on? We have been operating through the year with relatively less risk and what I would call relatively less long biased risk, meaning expectations of asset prices to rise, then we would normally have done or had done a year or two ago. So in the language of traders we manage from a defensive position. Which means that things could still go wrong in unexpected ways or that you feel confident that you have this. I mean you live through the financial crisis. Yes. And every two weeks somebody says this is going to be worse than a financial crisis. This is worse than 70s. What kind of crisis are we going to see in what's it mean for the banks? Yeah. First of all, I don't think as far as the banking system goes, this will be worse than the financial crisis. I think banks are much better capitalized but much better risk managed and much more aware of the importance of doing that than they were back then. And the regulators are also much more intimately involved and engaged with the banks in understanding bank exposures. So I think it's not going to be like that. I think from our point of view and speaking for Barclays, what we have to worry about is the impact on consumers. We are starting at a point where people have strong balance sheets and employment is very high. So these are very good initial conditions. But squeezes are coming in different ways. In the UK, to a greater degree than the US, you've got the energy price squeeze. And also in the UK to a greater degree than in the US, you've got a squeeze coming from higher interest rates and mortgage prices and rents. Because it's more of a variable rate market. It's a more of a fixed market than it used to be. But it's more variable than the US is, which has a 15 or 30 of fixed market. But you're not seeing that right in consumer spending right now. You're not seeing it in in in mortgages either. Is there worry that we're complacent? And then at some points next year, early next year, it hits us hard. Not that we are complacent. But even though we started off in a good condition, there are factors that are eroding that strength of the consumer balance sheet. What I'm hoping you see is what people will call a soft landing and a shallow recession, helped by the initial conditions. And so what you might see is an increase in unemployment. You might see some credit weakness among customers. But it won't be so bad that you see distress in society. However, it has to be managed carefully and it has to be managed aggressively with the balancing of the budget. And that's what the Prime Minister has said in the last couple of days. The top names in climate change are on Bloomberg. I want everybody committed to the kind of action that we need. We have a global emergency now. You know, we're still putting 162 million tons of man-made global warming pollution into the sky every day using the sky as an open sewer. That's trapping as much extra heat as would be released by 600,000 erosion of class at Tommy Palm exploding every day. That's what the scientists tell us and the data shows it. That's crazy. That's why we have a third of Pakistan underwater. That's why we have the historic heat wave in China. Nothing comparable to that ever. That's why the heat records are broken every year. And we're seeing an increase in the flows of climate refugees.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1236,2022-11-20 16:10:46
18623," In China, nothing comparable to that ever. That's why the heat records are broken every year. And we're seeing in an increase in the flows of climate refugees crossing international borders that are due to vastly expand unless we take action to solve the climate crisis. Nobody covers climate change like Bloomberg, your global business authority. I'm going to talk to you a little bit about the last six weeks. You mentioned the guilt. Was there a moment where you were in the office thinking like, as Barclays, you're one of the players in selling and buying guilds with the margin calls coming in and saying, I don't know what happens in the next two hours? So first of all, I think that the volatility was managed extremely well by the very effective targeted and time-bound actions of the Bank of England. So I think buying guilds, buying inflation linked guilds, and then the repo facility that they put in working with the banking system all helped ease the pressure in the crisis. And you've got 10-year guild heels now back below where they were at the day of the mini budget on the 23rd of September. As for us, we are large in the guilds market. What was important for us, as we saw it, was this was not a solvency issue at all for the pension system. It was a liquidity issue. And it was a liquidity issue because what was a very important feature of the UK pension system, which by the way, I think is a good feature of the pension system, which is a matching of assets and liabilities, which employed leverage, created a liquidity problem. So a liquidity problem had to be managed. And the liquidity problem was managed by the government intervention or the Bank of England intervention, the repo facility, which allows people to borrow against assets rather than sell them and by slowly releasing the pressure. And so far, so good. Do you think that will change actually, where you're liations around new pensions in the UK? So I don't know the answer, but I think what is important is that the UK pension system in aggregate is very well funded. It's about a hundred and twenty five hundred and thirty percent funded ratio, which is extraordinarily good, which gives it a good starting point from which to manage to a less leverage future. Is liquidity your biggest concern for banks right now? I mean, we're again hearing the US Treasury Secretary having to do things, maybe to put a bit of extra liquidity to pat it out in the Treasury market. Bank liquidity, I don't think, is an issue. We've had liquidity regimes, you know, funding models are much, much more robust than they were in the financial crisis. I think part of what people are worried about and what they saw in the guilt market was the liquidity in underlying trading, which is that these markets are not deep with smaller bit of small bit offers in large sizes of trades as they used to be fifteen years ago. And I think part of it are banks are more prudent in managing their risk. So that's a good thing. It's a good thing, but it has a consequence that the big providers of liquidity have moved away from the banking system to the buy side. Do you worry about shadow banking? And is there any crossover? Does that, if you look at the system as a whole, if there's something wrong with shadow banking, does it impact the big banks? So it impacts the big banks, and by shadow banking, let's, I'll narrow it. I'll narrow it to, let's call FinTech companies. Right. So it impacts the banks in a good way and a bad way. So in a good way, what they've done is they've provided digital technology, ways of giving services to customers, which customers like, and it's made us up all game, right? And faster than we would have otherwise. And shame on us for not having done it earlier. That's a good question.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1237,2022-11-20 16:15:09
18624," which customers like, and it's made us up all game, right? And faster than we would have otherwise. And Shemun us for not having done it earlier. Now, when they go into credit, which some of them have done, they have less regulation than we do, which is perhaps not good for customers who deal with them, who may not get the protections, they do if they deal with us. And perhaps not good for them if they don't lend with quite the rigor and standards that more established companies might. On the second issue, that's a supposition. Let's see. What's your relationship like with the new UK government? Have you had calls? Have you, have they given your assurance about windfall taxes? Well, I think the government is brand new. So we obviously, many of the faces are very familiar faces. And we've been dead in communication with them in many, for many years. And we always are with the government. And we are waiting to see their proposals on taxation, on fiscal policy, on all aspects of it. Where do you see the city of London being in four or five years? I mean, that's maybe too long a time frame. Should I say 12 months? Well, it's both too long and too short. Here we are in the city. And this city has been the center of finance for 300 years. And it needs to be the center of finance for 300 more years. We certainly would wish that that were the case. And it is the center of finance because of an excellent regulatory system, transparent, fair. It is there because of great availability of talent and infrastructure, soft financial infrastructure and high financial infrastructure. And a part of that is also a stable, predictable taxation regime. So we hope that all those elements and ingredients remain and continue to allow the city to flourish. And the Prime Minister spoke about investing in education in Britain. And if you think about what drives the financial sector, I mean, you meet many of them. It's about the wonderfully trained people in the UK and the wonderfully trained people outside who are able to come and work in the UK. The UK has lost something. The city of London has lost business to other parts of the world in terms of financial capitals. What do you need from the government today for that to be reversed? Well, some of it is what others do. So once Brexit happened and you could not pass support financial services to London, all the major banks had to set up trading enterprises in Europe. So that is irreversible, let's say, for the time being. I think other than that, what we need is a continuation of what London has provided. Education, infrastructure, people, great regulatory regime, and a stable and predictable fiscal regime. Until not too long ago, Barclays had an activist shareholder on its back. Do you think about that? You always have to think about it. I don't think about it from the point of view of our business mix. I do think we have a good business mix. And that activist shareholder came because he thought we should sell our investment bank. He could not have been more wrong. I repeat it, he could not have been more wrong. The investment bank has been what has kept Barclays flourishing and quite apart from many of our competitors. In the fact that we performed extremely well during COVID, we are able to have a more diversified business model. But I think for many banks like us, where our valuations are low, you've always got to be worried about what is driving bank valuations. I think it is crucially important. And I think we've moved from this attitude, from its indulgence, a waste of time, almost an illness that needs a cure. For something as universally important to human life as sleep, mysteries surrounding its necessity and utility have only just been recently uncovered. Some of our biggest discoveries were in the 1970s or 1980s. And so it makes it a really exciting field, because it seems as though we're uncovering new insights each and every day. Some scientists are going further to find out how sleep and what happens there can be harnessed to further expand our understanding. It's easy to memorize, and that makes you smart. As we go through our PhD with general coding, our repeatedly experienced solution supplies and compost� for environmental cost 000 billion, putting 20 million gemcapers in the public week, taking a whole seemed installation on how to obtain more memory-cost information.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1238,2022-11-20 16:19:32
18625," and what happens there can be harness to further expand our understanding. It can spit back a lot of facts. When and how and why to use that information and that's what you bring figures out while you're sleeping. Is Europe over banked? Europe is against separate Europe from the UK. I don't think the UK is over banked. I think part of what drives bank valuations especially in Europe versus the US is there is some worry about business model. I think in our case we've got the right business model and what will drive our valuation is solid performance, excellent performance. I think in Europe banking is still fairly nationalized, not nationalized in state owned but by country. I think we have to see at some point the experiment of one large European bank crossing borders in a meaningful way and then we'll know. Do you think that will happen or is it just a dream? We've been talking about it. I feel like for two decades. It's a question more for the European bank CEOs. I think it should happen. I think the test case should happen and now is a good time. When you go through a period like this there will be some banks which will benefit from consolidation and ownership by a larger entity. I hope I see it happen and it will be good for Europe. Your bank is doing pretty well. Others are doing less well. Have you been able to get some business from clients that no longer want to bank with them? Business goes in every way in the banking industry. Obviously where credit swists have pulled out of certain businesses such as the prime business we got some business from their clients. But look they announced a big restructuring. We wish them well. It is important for the banking system for there to be many players who are strong. I think with this restructuring hopefully credit swists is on a good upward trend and regains the prominence it used to have. I don't know if it's punishment coming or steps towards the people who did those mistakes. Where are we on that? We had an ovarishance of securities in the US. It was completely avoidable. It was one of these embarrassing moments you hate to have when you see Europe a bank. It is however it was a human error in a very narrow way. We have done both and had an external investigation on it and internal investigation. We have made good by all the clients affected. We have had a settlement with the SEC. We cooperated from the first minute fully with all our regulators and we dealt with the matter internally. We are in the final stages now where individuals who were affected or involved in this are being assessed. We have a standard process by which we do that. There will be implications for certain individuals but that process will play itself. Through your strategy we talked a little bit about the global economy. Do you worry that this way the inflation is going to get worse? When will we reach peak inflation? When will we know that we have reached peak inflation? You will know that the rate of change of inflation is stabilizing when the central banks start signalling it that in their rate rises. Going away.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1239,2022-11-20 16:23:42
18626," inflation is stabilizing when the central banks start signalling it that in their rate rises. Going away from 75 basis points, 100 basis points to something more normal and natural. Now mathematically there will be some forces that will bring inflation down, you know just because base effects as they call them. And I expect that will happen sometime in the middle of next year. Is there a danger that central banks messes up that they raise interest rates too much? Look, there's always a finely calibrated issue about when do you stop? And I think many people have sort of raised two worries. One is that there's a sort of supply chain led element of this, there's an energy shock element of this, employment is at all time highs, relatively speaking and that people have not seen such a hiking cycle in three decades. Having said that, I think the officials are all across the world are all very, very experienced and I think they will find the right way to calibrate it. How difficult is it in this uncertain environment, frankly, to calibrate where you want to grow businesses geographically in the world? Well, I'll speak for Barclays. We've got a real strength of the business in the US and the UK. We've got a good investment bank in Europe and a trading business. We had caught at an island but got a large trading presence in France. And then good presence in Asia, both in the Middle East and India. We've got an excellent investment banking franchise and Singapore and Hong Kong. I expect that footprint to remain broadly as it is. We have some very interesting partnerships in Australia. We might do some others. But I expect the broad footprint to be as it is. The geopolitical complexities which are also rising makes people more cautious also about which countries they want to go to. Have you had to increase wages? I'm not really thinking of the high flyer bankers, but just to match inflation in most of these places. So we did a fairly large program of wage rises in India where we've got a large number of employees last year in 2021. In the UK we did an interim adjustment in August of about 4% for a lot of our workers and then we are working through another one for the end of this year. And we did one in the US also late last year. So I think inflation, especially as it affects some of our workers, we're going to have to look at it and we're going to have to respond. When you look at the return to the office, I think you bankers have to be back four days a week. How's that going? It's going well. I think we always have to create a balance. There's a level of flexibility that's come into work life into the workplace since COVID, which I think is good. I think some of the stigma attached to working from home has gone away. And I think that's really important, especially for those who are managing young families or have other pressures that require them to spend more time at home or close to home. And I think we should continue that and should continue that in important ways. Some jobs require you to be in the office. Our trading flows are largely full five days a week and that's the way it should be. Our bank branches here in London also need to be stuffed and they should be. And for some other functions, it can be less. But I do think it's important for people in all functions at all levels to be in the office. This isn't a apprenticeship business at the end of the day. And it's important to have that productivity from being face to face. When you look at the strength and dollar, this could be a shorter term. It could last for a very long time if you look at King Dollar. What does it mean for Berkley's? Well, as a financial matter, it's actually good. We have about 40% of our revenues in dollars. We've got a fairly big business in the US. More broadly though, I mean world economies will have to adjust. And that adjustment process can be painful. And you can see the pain it's inflicting in Europe and the UK. Europe should be subsidized.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1240,2022-11-20 16:28:04
18627," We'll have to adjust. And that adjustment process can be painful. And you can see the pain it's inflicting in Europe and the UK. Expôt will be subsidized, but import prices go up. Vanca, thank you so much. Francine, thank you very much for having me. A lot of the satellites have propulsion systems. They can kind of move to get out of the way of each other. Or change their orbit a little bit. It's a service that you guys offered to help these companies know how to maneuver their machines. Yeah, we offer a collision avoidance service. It's a subscription service. We'll send you an alert up to seven days in advance. If your satellite's going to come dangerously close to a piece of debris or another satellite. Companies have been doing that for decades moving satellites around, but it's sort of like a harder problem now. The risk of a collision is a lot higher now. Just because we've installed so much more hardware into space. You have a big collision that creates a cloud of debris. And now all the other satellites are flying through this whizzing mess of debris. As we add all of the new satellites into space, the risks of a collision, the likelihood of the collisions going up.

They're at the vanguard of a green transition. They're delivering locally in a time of global energy turmoil. Utility companies are having their moment in the sun. Energy is on every one's mind around the world. Energy independence, energy prices, energy availability. Utilities historically have been viewed as stodgy, slow moving, boring companies. I would not be here if it were anything like that. The utilities that are going to thrive in this environment are the ones who have a diversified energy mix. Particularly the ones who have a higher percentage of clean energy resources that is reliable, such as nuclear, as well as wind and solar and gas in the mix to back those up. Duke Energy, providing regulated gas and electric services to about 10 million customers in seven US states, has flourished in the spotlight. Revenues have rebounded since COVID rocked the industry in 2020. The volatility that's driven profits has also created pressures. We're in a period of inflation. We're in a period where commodity prices are high. So, if you're in a period of inflation, you're in a period of inflation.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1241,2022-11-20 16:32:23
18628," To the industry in 2020, the volatility that's driven profits has also created pressures. We're in a period of inflation. We're in a period where commodity prices are high. So every season of leadership is going to have some particular challenge. And Duke will meet these challenges with fresh leadership. After almost a decade at the helm of finance, Steve Young decided to step away from the role. In September 2022, company veteran Brian Savoy became CFO. Why now retire from your position as CFO? I thought it was time. It made a lot of sense. Brian is ready. Succession planning is something that is ongoing at Duke Energy. And this gave us an opportunity to promote Brian, someone who has great financial background, good market and economic background, who also has led businesses, so understands P&L. And so it just felt like the right time to begin that transition. The transition in the C-suite comes as duke and barks on a transformation of its business. Aiming to retire all coal by 2035, achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050, and reshape its portfolio around natural gas, nuclear power and renewables. We're basically rebuilding generation and transmission and distribution to meet the needs of the future. We're going to invest $145 billion over a decade. That is a staggering amount of money, which means it's a staggering amount of things we've got to go buy, replace, install, make work, and do it in an affordable way for our customers. That's a tall order. It's a team effort. So boy, we'll have plenty of support from Young, who's now Duke's chief commercial officer, and Lynn Good, who was once Duke's CFO herself. Any advice you want to give him? Your CFO hat. C-E-O hat, you can't give advice. The CFO hat. The advice I gave him was, you know, jump in with all fours and make this job as big as you can. Because you sit at the nexus of so many things in the chief financial officer role. The business, the regulation, the finance, delivering value to investors and to customers. And I think Brian is very capable of doing that. It's an amazing time to be in this role in this moment. Stressful? Extremely. And daunting. There's a lot going on, but I wouldn't have it any other way. Here's what Duke's power generation mix looked like in 2021, with coal and oil nearly a quarter of the portfolio. Here's how it should look by 2030. We have been putting pieces in place in our regulated business for several years to really accelerate this clean energy transition. Renewables bring price stability because there's no fuel. I see there's a sun shine or the wind. There's typically a significant capital of front investment, but it's predictable. Natural gas is needed to balance the grid and the reliability needs because the wind doesn't blow all the time, the sun doesn't shine all the time, the batteries can't bridge the gap enough. So our plan is to reduce natural gas over time, but use it as a bridge fuel as we proliferate renewables and nuclear has been just a tremendous benefit for our customers. And we see promise in future nuclear in the 2030s as we move through transition. That's not the only transition Brian's avoid will manage. Newquants to focus its time, money and resources on its regulated businesses and it's looking for a buyer for its commercial renewable energy holdings. Our commercial business is one that I ran, so I'm very familiar with, and it served this very well, but it is only 5% of our company, right? And our regulated business has a clear path to growth and the competition for capital's fierce inside our company. And there are a lot of interest. There's a lot of money wanting to invest in green energy. They are performing a strategic review right now of this business and I think it makes sense to do so, right? Because in the intuitive space to really get credit in evaluation for a non-regulated business such as renewable generation, right? You have to do it at a much larger scale. And it does make sense to take a closer look at maybe somebody else is a better sort of capital here and recycle capital to redirect that into the regulated business.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1242,2022-11-20 16:36:47
18629," with at the March larger scale. And it does make sense to take a closer look at maybe somebody else's a better sort of capital here and recycle capital to redirect that into the regulated business. Duke Forecast earnings growth, the five to seven percent through 2026, driven by a lot of capital investment. The company intends to spend a whopping $145 billion in the next decade, where the lion share going to changing its energy mix and modernizing its grid. Brian Savoy is in charge of deploying this capital under highly challenging conditions, including the highest inflation and most volatile energy prices in decades. When you get a surprise like high fuel prices, we need to adjust things like O&M. And so we work with operations and the relationships I have throughout the company are positioning me well to help influence our operators to adjust their cost as we need to for customers. Do you feel that reducing costs right now while also increasing spending is different than in the past because of the inflationary pressures because of the energy transition? I would say yes. There are a lot of pressures on the business that we might have had in short spells in the past, but it feels more systemic that we're going to see, inflation for some time, higher commodity prices. With the kind of volatility, if someone comes to us, I hate Brian, so I need some more money for my division to do this. Are you like the no guy? Or are you able to be really nimble and make sure you can be the yes guy? I would say I'm the how can we. Okay. But if we say yes to a request that was emergent, we get to say no to some other things. So how do we prioritize and make it all work? CEO and former CFO Lin Good knows how hard this balancing act can be. I think anytime you're trying to balance, you get pulled in various directions. There will be a pull to build more renewables by certain of our stakeholders. There will also be a pull not to go that fast because it could be too expensive. Maybe our industrial customers are worried about price. The vulnerable customers worried about price. So trying to strike that right balance with policy makers, with customers, with investors is a challenge in any moment and they'll be a challenge in this one. I'm taking it inside some of the conversation you guys are having a do right now. So you and Lin and other C-suite executives sitting around on table, what do you guys talk about most right now? Supply chain has been a moving target of issues. Last year at this time, we were looking at solar panels and how do we lock in our solar panels that we need for the next several years to ensure we can execute the clean energy transition. It has moved to different components like transformers, which are essential for the grid, interest rates and the pace at which the Fed is moving interest rates is something we talk about each and every week. And when will that flatten out and how will that impact our business? We are a very large debt issuer. So we watch this extremely closely because it affects our cost structure. Do you want to wait until interest rates level off and then is that delay your capital raising to deploy your plan? We don't wait, but we do plan. When there's opportunistic times to issue debt, we will go with larger pieces or versus smaller. And we can work with the length of the debt, right? If 10 year is price more attractive than 20 or 30, we'll use the tenor to optimize the interest rate. That's all I knew, yeah? Yes. Coming up, Brian Savoy takes me to the room where it happens. An expert team gathers data and makes decisions that keep dukes renewables running smoothly. They're looking for the smallest change in output because every megawatt hour is money. This is Bloomberg. Brian Savoy is taking on a new challenge as he steps.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1243,2022-11-20 16:41:02
18630," Brian Savoy is taking on a new challenge as he steps into the CFO position at Duke Energy. It's really just his latest challenge. He's touched virtually every area of the company over the last two decades. I started my career at Duke in Houston in our trading business and I was with Deloitte Toosh before I joined Duke, Duke was one of my clients. You know what I saw in Brian was tremendous enthusiasm and energy. He was ready to take on new assignments. He was thinking about advancing the ball for the corporation as opposed to any personal goals and that came through. He helped us on a number of complex projects and the more we gave him the more he continued to grow. I've had different roles in 10 years and I've seen different parts of the company from you know transformation, leading natural gas and commercial strategy. This has prepared me for the role I have today. What's the advice that you've given him? You know I've told him a couple of times that you're not going to get a home run at every at bat. There's going to be days where things go wrong. The patient, the calm. Keep your eye on the ball for the future, the thing you want to get to eventually, you'll have bumps in the road. Fixing things that go wrong and smoothing out bumps in the road is what customers expect from energy providers. And for Duke's renewable assets, that process is overseen from one room in an office building in Charlotte, North Carolina. Ryan's voice showed me around the company's Renewable Control Center. This is where our operators are monitoring and managing over 5,000 megawatts of renewables across the United States. How would this differ from like a conventional asset monitoring center? Yeah, so assets historically they would have the monitoring center on site. So you might have an operator with screens, but at the site, whereas this we can do 90 sites. So when onshore wind, solar, and they're looking for the smallest change in output because every megawatt hour is money. You put an asset in, let's say it's 100 megawatts, you expect to get 100 megawatts each and every hour that the resource is there. The resource could be sunshine or it could be wind. And when you get 90 or 80, you're not producing what you can. And it can be because the asset isn't working properly, maybe something hit the turbine blade on the wind form, maybe the solar panel has debris on it or it could be the solar intensity is not quite there. When one of these assets isn't producing full capacity, we're putting another resource on it and we're having to toggle this on a consistent basis. And this as clouds come, this is by the minute. This is not or the hour itself, no, it's by the minute and then it'll fall, come back and we have assets that follow this digitally as well so that we can keep a consistent flow of electrons on the grid. The operators in this room can respond to incoming data with immediate action, remotely controlling wind turbines, solar panels, and batteries. It's another example of using digital and technology tools to make us more efficient, to make us more productive, minimizing the amount of people we have to have running around and observing and giving us the statistics to really be able to maintain and monitor those facilities. We couldn't see degradation and output as fast as we do now with the technology and the digitalization of the system. Now we still need technicians nearby and so we use traveling crews that can go say sites in Kansas versus sites in South Texas versus central Texas and across the west. We have around the clock shifts, but about 20 people rotate through these shifts and again recovering 90 sites, we got about half a dozen people here at any given time managing it. You could think that would scale at over time as renewables grow in the United States. So would you say that as you invest more in renewables, it's a hardware thing or a software thing, like where do you think we spend the most money doing that? Obviously the software will continue to improve over time and the sensors on the equipment are very important to, again, identify those degradation and output, but it's deploying the hardware, deploying the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1244,2022-11-20 16:45:22
18631," and the sensors on the equipment are very important to, again, identify those degradations and output, but it's deploying the hardware. Deploying the assets on the ground, getting the sites ready, connecting to the grid is a huge lift. Duke's hardware and software mix keeps evolving, and so does its workforce. Retooling also means retraining. We've moved people to the renewable space. Some of these folks used to be in coal. We've moved people to cybersecurity, which is a growing area that we need more and more, because as everything gets digitized, there's more opportunities for bad actors to penetrate. So we need high cybersecurity skills, and when you match that with operating skills, you really have a beautiful mix that makes a strong, strong operator. Operators here have plenty of micro details to keep track of, but there's a macro factor on their minds as well. That's the weather. We have maps in the United States just to give the operators a bearing of what's going on in the country. And we have plotted on it where our renewable sites are, so they know if there's a weather pattern, weather system coming, I expect that in that area. How do you manage extreme weather? So let's say we have a wind farm in the west, and a wind storm is coming. Yeah. You know, the assets will turn off when the wind speeds exceed a certain level, automatically. Okay. Because there's risk of breakage of the blades and damage to people and assets and stuff. We know a wind storm is coming that might damage the solar or a hail storm, for instance, right? We can watch those assets closer, we can put a crew on site, but this team would be dispatching those crews onto the location. And that's where the weather map and the team really works together. That's right. And hurricanes in the southeast to wildfires in the west, extreme weather events are becoming more prevalent and more intense. Utility companies are bracing for greater risk. When we think about the impacts of extreme weather events on the grid, large grid connected resources would still, such as large-scale solar farms and large-scale wind farms, would still rely on a centralized grid to deliver electricity to the load centers. So, to the extent that the grid is knocked out by a hurricane, those assets would go offline as well. So, in addition to investing in green generation resources, is extremely important in companies pay attention to grid-hardening measures. We're seeing more of it, more frequency of severe events and how we predict those, monitor those, and estimate the damage using data analytics and machine learning to say, how many customers might be out of this happens, what generators are at risk, and all that modeling goes into our planning for what we put our investments. We talked about the capital plan earlier. All those investments are informed by the climate trends that we see across our system. Coming up, Duke's Clean Energy Plans get a major boost from DC with the Inflation Reduction Act. Ryan Savoy is already working through the possibilities. For example, 1,000 megawatts of solar equates to about 60 million in annual production tax credits. This is Bloomberg. Imagine simply climbing a cable into space. The concept is known as the space elevator. Not only could it significantly change how we leave planet Earth, but it could also completely transform humanity's relationship with space. And they're a scientist who think we could have already built it. We have the material, we have the technology, we have the lasers, we have the climbers, we have all of it. If a private entity wants to build it, or a government, they can build it. It'll change society. We have no clue how colonizing in the space, how really spreading on the space, really change our society over the next 50 to 200 years. It'll be completely different. You will shed light on dark matter. You will make a agent of...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1245,2022-11-20 16:49:45
18632," You will shed light on dark matter. You will make aging optional. You will turn 5G up to 11. Because when you subscribe to Bloomberg, you won't just get news. You'll get insight into limitless possibilities, knowledge, and inspiration to feed your ambition. So before you invent pioneer, just rubbed. Before you change the world, Bloomberg. We call Japan ahead right here on Bloomberg Television. The next decade for Duke Energy is pretty clearly mapped out. Raise and spend $145 billion on a massive clean energy transition. But the bulk of those investments into regulated businesses while investigating the sale of non-core assets to fund that push. All be up to new CFO Brian Savoy to execute this plan and make sure it delivers optimal financial growth. The motion is adopted. Congress passed the inflation reduction act in August, putting provisions in place that make his task more manageable. The inflation reduction act provides incentives for renewables. It provides incentives for battery storage. And it provides incentives for nuclear. All of those incentives for a regulated company go right to our customers. They reduce directly the price of our product. So when I build a renewable product, it's going to cost me less. And it'll cost my customers less. It's going to help our renewable transition. For example, 1,000 megawatts of solar equates to about 60 million in annual production tax credits. We're going to have 30,000 megawatts of renewables on our system by 2035. The inflation reduction act has been a very important piece of legislation. It's not only that it creates a number of incentives for a variety of assets. It also is very durable in long term. So instead of a patchwork of different tax credits that we've seen in the past, it actually creates a light path going well into 2030s for this long term transition on the grid. Political winds may shift, and regulations are always subject to change. For the moment, policy in Washington aligns with Duke's strategic goals. What do you think there's a parallel partnership now? We have a voice at the table. I have a lot of conversations with the Treasury Department about tax policy. And as they define the rules around the IRA, they will seek input from people like us. And we will weigh in. This is what you should think about as you write the detailed rules to implement this act. When it comes to relationship between utility and policy makers and regulators, those have always been extremely important. Those utilities that cultivate have cultivated those relationships in a constructive fashion where they've been good stewards of capital and operate the system well and took into consideration interest of various stakeholders in addition to the equity and debt investors, of course. Those utilities enjoy relationships with the regulators in our experience. And that over time translates into constructive rate outcomes and better recovery mechanism. Recovery mechanisms are set at the state level. They also help companies and customers absorb the capital costs of the clean energy transition. We cannot adjust our price without working through regulators. And modern recovery mechanisms allow us to adjust price more frequently and align with our investments. So that when the investments start causing expenses, revenues follow. And there's alignment. Otherwise, we call it regulatory lag where you have expenses before we can earn revenues on those assets. Historically, we would build up investments, then have what's called a rate case, and have a large increase in one one slot. The modern recovery mechanisms place assets and service each year essentially. So your smoothing rate increases over time. So customers can plan better and we can plan better. Even with meticulous planning and regulatory tailwinds, U.S utilities must proceed with...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1246,2022-11-20 16:54:08
18633," With meticulous planning and regulatory tailwinds, U.S. utilities must proceed with caution. Europe's energy crisis highlights the fight between green energy and energy security, raising questions about how fast and hard the world can pivot. There's been criticisms, say, in Europe that they were trying to go too fast into renewables, for example, and therefore they left out nuclear and they sort of shuttered coal plants and now they're paying the price in that respect. What's the right pace? I think the pace is maintaining balance with reliability and affordability. That's the only way we know to gauge pace. We will not put a plan together that we don't have a high degree of confidence. We can serve our customers every hour, every season. And we have to keep an eye on affordability. We call it a responsible balance transition. The transition away from fossil fuels is coming. It's think about coal. Five years ago you could get as much coal as you want. Now coal is constrained and it's going to become even more constrained. So operating coal assets is not even going to be an option as we move through time. So the convergence of energy independence and security I believe is coming soon. That's the state of play for Brian Savoy. As he starts his tenure as Duke's CFO, I asked him what he sees when he looks ahead. What is the biggest opportunity over the next 10 years as CFO that you're most excited about? Over the next decade I feel like utilities have a moment to really make a mark on society. And again it's long lasting. It's going to be for our grandkids and their grandkids. So putting the utility sector in prominence of the world, that's what I want to do. What's the biggest challenge? What are you most worried about in the next 10 years in doing your job? I think the biggest challenge is balancing investment. The investments we need to make and the transition in front of us with the cost to customers. Because the oversight by regulators is only getting more and more and more. And we've got to be more clear on the customer benefits of every dollar we spend that turns into value for customers. And I can see this playing out in just hand-to-hand combat over the next decade and we will work it. And we believe the investments we're making will meet that bar. What is the skill that you have as CFO that you think will help that? I'm worried for value. I don't like waste at all. And when I see things that we need to change, I have the courage to make it happen. And as CFO I'm in a position to really move that and Duke. And what's a new skill set of knowledge that you're excited about over the next 10 years? I would say the new skill set would be how to balance all of the external views of the company with the internal. I've worked inside this company and have great influence. But ensuring that similar level of influence is out in the external world. What's the best advice you've received coming into CFO? You know, I will go back many years ago. Over 10 years ago, I was working for Linn. And she told me, Brian, the skills you have positioned you for a wide range of roles. I had no idea what that meant. Then this was like 2009. But as I've looked at my career and she has moved me to gain experience across Duke in the right areas of operations and strategy, that advice back then, I didn't appreciate but I appreciate it now more than ever. I'm Alex Steele. This is Bloomberg. We don't have enough women founder CEOs who are getting funding. So basically less than 2% of VC funds go to women, less than 1% go to women of color. And so in this innovation space, I said to myself, what's the best way to use capital to move things for women? And that's when I started to say, okay, I actually need to move some money into the venture capital space. And I want to do it smartly. I mean, the first goal is to make money. I'm not...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1247,2022-11-20 16:58:36
18634," Capital to move things for women. And that's when I started to say, okay, I actually need to move some money into the venture capital space. And I want to do it smartly. I mean, the first goal is to make money. I'm not putting my money out as a social impact. I'm putting it out to make money. But I wanted to go behind funds like aspect ventures that's run by Theresa Gaugh and Jennifer Pondstadt who are looking at these opportunities and they have a thesis around my gosh. There are so many opportunities there if we go towards funding some of these women businesses. Some LPs have said to me, all we care about is returns. Some of the best investors may not be the best people, but they have the best returns. What do you have to say to those people? I have to say you're investing in what you know. And so you need to look at what trends are coming in the nation and how you're going to dress them. Women are 85% of consumer dollars spent. Women controls 70% of financial decisions in the house. So if you're not investing in products that go towards females or women led company, you're missing an opportunity because you just don't see it. What do you think of when you think of a battery? For most, it's what we use to power devices for both work and play and maybe even your car. Over the past few decades, they've gotten way more powerful, long-lasting and affordable. But all of this is just a prologue to what the next batteries are going to do. As we drive to an increasingly renewable power driven grid, we also need to be able to store energy and release it later to cover those periods of weather intermittencies that are driving this new grid that we're in. It's a multi-trillion dollar opportunity and it's imperative that we figure out the solution here. How we store energy on a massive scale is in many ways the central challenge of the fight to stop climate change. No one covers the world like Bloomberg. The writings on the wall for the bank of England just stock oil has spray painted the front door. Session in Europe, UK and possibly the US. The millions are out in full force celebrating the election victory of former President, Bula, the Silver. With unmatched reach and resources from more than 120 countries, the moment news breaks 24 hours a day. Bloomberg, your global business authority. This is Bloomberg Daybreak, but let's do it. Welcome to Daybreak Australia. Stay as Canada the closest. Welcome to Bloomberg crypto. A week of hope about inflation and interest rates, about China's relations with the United States, about Britain getting serious about its budget. And of course, former President Trump's hope that he can do it all again. This is Bloomberg Wall Street week. I'm David Weston. This week, special contributor Larry Summers on what came out of the G20 meetings in Bali. And former Fed Vice Chair Rich Clarita, on the liquidity problem in the Treasury's market. And what can be done about it? It was a week of hoping, hoping that things just might start to move in a better direction in US-China relations. After a President Biden's meeting in Bali with President Xi. I absolutely believe there's need not be a new Cold War. I do not think there's any imminent attempt on the part of China to invade Taiwan. And I made it clear that our policy in Taiwan has not changed at all. Hoping that inflation may just be easing a bit in the United States with Fed Vice Chair Leo Brainer telling Bloomberg we might see a bit of moderation in rate hikes. I think it will probably be appropriate to move to a slower pace of increases. But I think what's really important to emphasize, we've done a lot, but we have additional work to do both on raising rates and sustaining restraint to bring inflation down. Hoping that the economy will be able to move forward",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1248,2022-11-20 17:02:54
18635," We've done a lot, but we have additional work to do, both on raising rates and sustaining restraint to bring inflation down. Hoping that the new British government has gotten the message, as it put forth a new budget designed to reassure the markets. So today we deliver a plan to tackle the cost of living crisis and rebuild our economy. Our priorities are stability, growth, and public services. And then of course, there's that special kind of hope the former President Trump brings to everything he does, deciding that despite what happened in the midterms to his hand-picked candidates, this was the right time to announce he's running again for President. In order to make America great and glorious again, I am tonight announcing my candidacy for President of the United States. Even as prominent investor and Republican supporter Ken Griffin of Citadel couldn't find much to hope for in Mr. Trump's candidacy. He lost in 2020. We lost Georgia because of his behavior in the Senate race in 2020. That's a second loss. And then this year the Republicans lost the Senate because the Trump-back candidates in the Senate races were rejected by American voters. That's a three-time loser. And I'd like to think that the Republican party is ready to move on from somebody who has been for this party a three-time loser. But whatever we were all hoping for this week, we didn't really get that much out of the market. It's which traded without real conviction, with the S&P 500 off just 7-10-some of a percent for the week. And the Nasdaq down 1.57 percent. And the yield on the 10-year up about seven basis points in the week at 3.82. To help us sort it all out, we welcome now a sunny, bachelor CEO of Rock Creek and Bob Michael, his chief investment officer and head of the Global Fixed Income Unit at JP Morgan Asset Management. So welcome both of you. Great to have you back. Bob, let me start with you. I mean, I watched the ECO numbers. I listened to the Fed speak. I sort of felt like I was going both ways at the same time. What did you see? Well, for a bond investor, all of us who have been battered this year, this is one of the weeks that made sense to us. We had a nice tailwind coming in from the inflation data. It was great all the way through core when you look at shelter everything. Yes, the markets went a little crazy. They went wild and the central bankers did what they're supposed to do. They came in one by one and reminded us, don't declare victory yet. These are only a couple of prints. There are more hikes to come, but maybe there is some optimism. And the market settled down. So I look at this week and I thought, this is the first great week in a long time. So Sunny, is that the way you saw it as well? There's still some more red hikes to come. How many? I think at least another three to start with, 50 basis points next time in December, followed by at least two or three 25 basis points next year. And then we'll see from there. And I think what Bob said is very true at the same time as we were listening to at least three Fed people come and speak. I wrote down, I think they all had very different codes. And you had some of that when Leibbernard talked. But you also had the president of St. Louis Fed say something slightly different as if we would start continue with rate increases for a while longer than she had implied. And then of course, we had Susan Collins come in today with even sort of potential 75 basis points. So we're hearing numbers that are a little bit all over the place and trying to make sense of it. Bob, are the markets making it harder for the Fed as a practical matter? They were at the start of the week. I think not so much now. I think we're all in the same spot. We've all got realistic expectations. The Fed's headed to four and a half, five percent. They'll get there sometime in the first quarter. We'll see where inflation is if it's below the Fed funds rate. Then that gives them some scope to pause on the tightening. We can reevaluate at that point. But right now, Bon Yelts have gone up a long way in a very short period of time. It's time for a breath. Bob, does that get us to a soft landing? Unfortunately, it does not. And I think that's the one consistent message from the Fed. Susan Collins aside, which is there is going.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1249,2022-11-20 17:07:15
18636," Unfortunately, it does not. And I think that's the one consistent message from the Fed. Susan Collins aside, which is there is going to be pain for businesses and households. When you have this magnitude of rate hikes in such a short period, and you're also withdrawing liquidity through quantitative tightening, it's going to bite. And we're already seeing it's biting the economy hard. Thankfully, it's also now starting to bite inflation. So I want to pick up on the liquidity just for a moment if I could have Sonny. How big a problem do we have in the Treasury market now with the liquidity? Here conflicting things, but some people are very concerned about it. Big problems. I think Bob leaves it much more than I do. But as you know, they're very, very big problems with the trading volumes. And for big traders or even small traders, getting a bit is becoming much harder. And you're working in a much less liquid environment. And I know between Treasury and the banks, there have been a lot of meetings, but I'm not so sure if we have a solution yet. Well, Bob, could the Fed make it easier with some regulatory changes? It could. But I think the moaning that we hear in the bond market about liquidity, it's always there. We always complain. We don't get the price we want. The reality is, for the last couple weeks, you could have moved your portfolio in any direction you wanted, up and down duration, up and down credit risk without any kind of penalty. So I'm not that big a believer in the lack of liquidity. I'm sorry when we talk about a soft landing, it brings me back to oil, because oil did move this week. And it moved down in the price of oil. And most people I talked to suggested it was in part because of a concern about global recession, really a backing off, or at least a softening in the markets. You came out of that business. You really know energy, backwards and forwards. What are we seeing in oil? So as you said, oil prices did, the future numbers went down below 80, which was a big shift from a little while ago. But my view is still that we might just avoid a recession in the US if we're fortunate. But we may not be able to avoid it in Europe and the rest of the world. And a lot of the, I think, softness for these numbers that we saw today and in recent days is because of the expectations in China. Now, China is starting to open up a little bit maybe and loosen its COVID rules. But that's going to take a while. And I think that softening is softening the oil markets. And we'll probably continue to do that. Is it opening up? I mean, I'm not exactly sure if exactly what's happening. Because on the one hand, we hear them saying things that sound a little softer on zero COVID and the other hand, we hear about a lot of cases. So it is. It was kind of interesting. And we had a team out in Asia this week. And they came back with interesting news that there is actually some physical opening up. But now you have people who are afraid to go out because they've been told so long that if they go out, they'll get COVID. And so you sing a very different phenomenon, which is actual, you know, individuals not wanting to go out of their houses versus the government, which has been very strict about you're getting out of your house. I'm sorry. I was at the G20, of course, meeting with my Bali. And some people thought there would be no single statement coming out of it. They did come to some agreement in part driven by some of the developing countries. Should that be encouraging to investors, actually, that we're getting back perhaps a little toward multilateral cooperation? Much more positive news came out of the G20 than we all expected. And as you said, there was also a lot of a big stress on reform of the multilateral lending. Because the big news out of that meeting was that there's huge needs when it comes particularly to emerging markets, climate-related investments. And there's no way with the existing finances of the multilateral that that could be met. So that was why there was a lot of emphasis on the reform of the multilateral sector, but also getting the multilateral to work much better with the private sector to generate more resources. And you saw that very particular case of Indonesia, which was discussed a lot and written up a lot with about 20 billion going into to replace coal in Indonesia with cleaner fuels. About another important development this week, sort of a rolling development is the outcomes of the midterm elections. We found out that the Democrats will hold on to the Senate. The Republicans will get a narrow-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1250,2022-11-20 17:11:39
18637," About another important development this week, it's sort of a rolling development, as the outcomes of the midterm elections. We found out that the Democrats will hold on to the Senate. The Republicans will get a narrow majority in the House. What does that communicate if anything to investors? Is that sort of a steady as you go way because we have a split government not much is going to happen either way? So it, for sure, is, I will tell you, going back to the G20, we're actually hearing from clients, large institutional clients, that they're more confident about allocating to markets when the G20 countries are talking to one another again and working with one another again. So that's a huge positive. I don't remember that in gosh, over a decade. When you go back to the gridlock in Washington, I hate to say it, but the markets kind of like it. It's when there are dramatic policy changes. You have to reprice everything in the markets. It becomes destabilizing. There are always going to be some winners. There are going to be some losers. This time, if we know we're going to have gridlock, we can focus on bringing inflation down and trying to avoid a recession and have a soft land. I think a lot of people in the street think that it's sort of hypocratic. First, do no harm. If you're not doing anything, you're not messing things up. Bob Michael of JPMorgan and Ann Fseil, a bachelor's of rock, we'll be staying with us as we look at what this week meant for our investment decisions. That's the next on Wall Street Week. I'm Bloomberg. Back in 1997, I was interested in the follow-up question, which is there are a bunch of the dinosaurs called Saurapod dinosaurs, which had really long skinny necks. So Apatosaurus is an example. That was at really long skinny tails. So I made a computer model that showed that in fact, the tail of these Saurapod dinosaurs could actually act like a whip, a bullfip. Now, the way a bullfip makes that cracking noise is because the tip of the whip actually goes about twice the speed of sound. And that crack is a sonic boom. I think the way they got to date was to impress the females by making loud booms. So it never became about politics for the world of business. Balance of power with David Weston, views and nettles, inside, from and above politics power players weekdays, this is Bloomberg. we think it will create some of the most valuable companies the markets have ever seen. I think it's certainly driven companies like Cisco, given them the life that they've had. It's obviously also spectacularly volatile, but the market has pulled back in this sector since it came public since it began in 1995. It's pulled back 30 to 50% at least seven or eight times. That was Henry Blodgett talking about the internet and tech on Wall Street way back in June of 2000. When the number one movie in the country was Mission Impossible Two, and the most popular song in the country was Maria Maria by Santana. Bob Michael of JPMorgan and Fsani Bachelors of Rod Creek are still with us. So Fsani certainly Mr. Blodgett was right that we gave us some awfully big and successful companies, no question about it. Some people thought that would happen as well in the crypto space. This week we're not quite as sure as...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1251,2022-11-20 17:16:03
18638," So, Sonny, certainly Mr. Blodgett was right that we gave us some awfully big and successful companies, no question about it. Some people thought that would happen as well in the crypto space. This week we're not quite as sure after FTX. What do we make of that? Does that have broader significance in the markets or is it just a one-off? Hopefully, it is more limited. I think there's no question that without regulation and we've all been talking about having this sector regulated. It would help. It's the market itself, but also the investors going in. I think this particular, you know, FTX, which is an exchange core crypto, be based in the Bahamas with not just no regulation, but also with a few people who had very limited experience in finance or in anything, really. I think the shocking part of it, David, was that very, very sophisticated venture firms from Sequoia and others who were invested. It was not just retail getting involved in that market. So it was a surprise, but hopefully it will get limited. And I think it has put a lot of pressure on increasing regulation sooner here. And that will be a good thing for the market. Now let's not forget that the whole market is less than, you know, a 900 billion. I'm not saying that that's tiny, but it's still not significant enough to create any kind of stress in the market unless we're missing something that we don't know at this point. I think what's important, David, when you watch that clip and that was the absolute peak in the dot com bubble, yes, there was a massive shakeout. There was a massive consolidation, but I would argue the internet and tech evolved far beyond what any of us ever thought it would be in 2000. I wonder if we're going through the same thing with crypto and NFTs that it got a great start. There is going to be a shakeout of Sonya's right. There's probably going to be a lot of regulation. But when I talk to the young people on our desk and our platform, there's still a big believer. And if the millennials are a believer, 22 years from now, they're going to be looking at this clip. And I hope we got it right. That's fascinating. There is no question as a generational issue here. Let's come back to the current generation and people as old as I am. I'm older than you are, but it's all like, what about bonds right now? Do you invest in bonds? For the first time in a decade, absolutely. And I will tell you that we're seeing interest from everywhere now. Every wealth management platform in JP Morgan, every institutional client, they're coming to us, they're putting money in bonds, they're looking to commit more, and they haven't done so for years. If I look at where we got to at the start of the year, a general bond fund, the Bloomberg Ag yielded 1.7%. Now we're up at 4.7%. We have 3% higher yields, and that's going to track investment. And as I said, I think the Fed is close to the end. I don't know if they get to 5%, we're kind of in the 4.5, 4.3 quarters percent. That's going to bring a lot of stability to the market at these levels. Bonds are back. So I'm saying you manage a fair amount of money. What about for you, are bonds attractive at this point, or are you just equities? I think as said, what is very interesting right now is even in any foundation or endowment or the assets that we manage, you're finding exactly the same phenomenon where people had moved away from bonds and cash, and we're all equities and private investments moving back into holding bonds. And as we're sort of reaching that 4.5% that Bob talked about, much more interest in bonds in a more balanced kind of portfolio. And of course, people are looking at cash with 4% at Treasury bills at the level that is much higher than cash in a very long time. But I think the bigger thing that is happening in the portfolio we're looking at is obviously a lot of investors, institutional investors who've been also investing in venture, private equity, real estate, in private form. And I think that is going to some sort of transformation too. Well, let's take a segue if we could from that sort of investment into COP27. As we're speaking right now, it's still going to end on Saturday. Right now, of Sony, you know far better than I do. It looks like it's going to be difficult for them to get to the objectives that they had. You're absolutely right. So far as we know tonight.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1252,2022-11-20 17:20:16
18639," far better than I do. It looks like it's going to be difficult for them to get to the objectives that they had. You're absolutely right. So far, as we know, tonight, the latest news was not too positive. Not things could change tomorrow morning, but they didn't really have anything major to announce. Again, as you remember in the COP26, they had the G-Fans, which was a large number of large asset managers, signing up to make pretty significant shifts in their carbon print. But most recently, they started walking back from that or not wanting to sign quite on what they had agreed to in COP26. So I think it's very, very important, as we're having these meetings, maybe they shouldn't be every year, maybe they should be every other year or less often, but show some sort of progress. And the most important part of the discussion this time, David, has been the fact that developing countries, again, have felt that they are in some cases suffering because if they're an island economy, they're going underwater. If they are affected by droughts and by floods, a lot of it might be caused by those who did use a lot of carbon over the last 10, 20 years, and they're asking if they could get help. And that help is really not coming. And I think that is the really major summary of COP27, which is that the expectations of investments into climate are probably less than what we expected going into the COP. Well, and just picking up on that on the investments in it, Bob, I want to come back to you, because I want to things at least I'm taking away from COP27. You could certainly hear, listen to John Kerry, the president's special envoy on this subject. We're not going to get to it from public money alone. It's going to take a fair amount of private investment. As a bond person, are there bonds that are green bonds or in the climate that make sense as a business matter? There are. I think for sure, if you're going to finance something, which is what bond investors do, you want something that has something of a green agenda to it. And we're hearing that from our clients. There's more and more money coming into this space. I think Afsania help is on the way for the island economies. The large-scale investors want to commit capital to this space. Well, the inflation reduction act, as it's called, a lot of people object to that title, put a lot of money into the game here on that private side of Sunday. Is it making a difference in the projects that are getting financed? No question. I think Dara is a very powerful act and is the largest amount of money going in. And I think that will really help us in the U.S. to invest a lot more in climate-related food and ag, in battery storage, in residential and in community-related solar and wind. So that will be a major, major push. And we're seeing, as Bob mentioned, a lot of movement. I agree with him. I think it's just that in COP, where you expected public money to go in, there was a sort of disappointment with that. But the private sector is doing a lot. The young generation is doing a lot. We just need the public sector to jump in when it comes to it outside of the IRA, of course. Bob, last word, are you seeing a difference in your part of the business for the government tax policy when it comes to green bonds? We are. Yeah, absolutely. It's making a real difference, you see it? It is from our perspective. So, yeah, everything we see that, and we didn't touch on the regulation, there's going to be more regulation poking through what qualifies as a green bond or not, and also to prevent any greenwashing either in specific bonds or in bond funds. So watch this space. Yeah, okay. We're interested particularly with the new Congress coming in. Thank you so much. Really great to have both of you.

You could always move away. You might have just started working remotely, so there's really nothing keeping you there. But then again, moving is a hassle. Well, what if someone paid you 10 grand to do it? What if they threw in free office space, a bicycle, or a gym membership? Programs and cities and states around the US are doing exactly that, and they're getting a lot of interest. We had over 50,000 applications. About 90,000 applications. We had over 1800 applicants from all over North America. So are these nascent programs actually beneficial to their communities and the workers joining them? Or are they little more than flashy advertising campaigns for places looking for an injection of fresh talent? The markets come down in Europe from the financial centers of the world. Bloomberg markets European pose with Guy Johnson in London and Alex Steele in New York. Real-time numbers, real-time analysis. We days. This is Wall Street Week. I'm David Weston. We spent a good deal of this week trying to figure out where the Fed is heading on rate increases. And part of what we were watching was the Fed's vice chair, Leo Brandard, who gave us at least some hope that we might be getting closer to slowing down. I think it will probably be appropriate soon to move to a slower pace of increases. But I think what's really important to emphasize, we've done a lot. But we have additional work to do both on raising rates and sustaining restraint to bring inflation down. We welcome now, Ms. Brandard's predecessor as vice chair Richard Clarota, now global economic advisor to PIMCO. So Richard, thank you so much for being back with us. Good to have you back with us. So do you agree with your successor there? Do you think we're at least approaching a point where we might slow down the pace of increases? David, I do. The Fed has done a lot this year. In fact, it will be the fastest pace of rate heights since the early 1980s. I do anticipate that at the December meeting they'll slow the pace from 75 to 50 basis points. And I think as we move into 2023, I think they think and I agree that they're close at least to a pause, probably in the first half of next year. They said in the November statement, they've done a lot and they want to see how the rate heights are impacting the economy. So Richard, you have the advantage of having been in the room and having been in the room relatively recently. Give us a sense of what they're looking at their dashboard because I'm going to say the economic numbers sometimes point in different directions. On the one hand, we do have some indications like the CPI numbers that may be slowing down a little bit.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1255,2022-11-20 17:33:12
18642," at their dashboard because I'm going to say the economic numbers sometimes point in different directions. On the one hand, we do have some indications like the CPI numbers that may be slowing down a little bit, the inflation on the other hand, the overall inflation is still pretty high. It is. And you know the challenge that faces another central banks in the world is that the economy is running hot. And in particular, wages in the economy are growing much faster than consistent with the 2% longer run goal. And so I think that the Fed will be looking at the labor market data. It'll also be looking at inflation expectations. We have downshifted demand growth. You know, there's an imbalance between demand and supply. And this year, demand growth has already downshifted. So that's an important thing to note. We're certainly along the way to where we need to be. But the Fed has more to do and we need to get inflation back down towards the 2% objective. So everyone seems to agree there's more for the Fed to be done. We just heard Leo Brenner say exactly that. The question is how much more? And part of the question is what's the terminal rate? I mean, how far up do we go? We had somewhat conflicting indications this week, actually. And the banks basically project these things are coming with the very different sorts of answers. What determines that terminal rate? And let me ask you, perhaps more pointedly, some people think the Fed was a little slow getting off the market and getting going. Does the slowness of getting started mean the terminal rate will have to be higher necessarily? David, I don't think so. I think what launching the rate hikes in March did mean. And I think Chair Powell recognized this pretty early on was that it made sense to get to the destination pretty quickly. And that's why we've had the four successive 75 basis point hikes. My sense right now is the committee believes. And I share the view that my baseline view is I want to get the funds rate around 5 percent if the inflation data comes in on the soft side, maybe four and three quarters. If it comes in on the hot side, maybe five and a quarter, or perhaps is President Ballard indicated maybe north of that. But I think around 5 percent in the spring will be at a level where they've done a lot. They realize that inflation responds to policy with a lag. And I think that that will be a good place to take stock. So I think that I wouldn't call that necessarily the terminal rate. I hope it is. If the inflation data doesn't improve, then they may have to do more. But I think they will pause at around 5 percent. So Richard, I think you just put the figure on the thing that at least perplexes me, which is a two-place function. I mean, you've got what the rates are. You also have what inflation is. And how restrictive that is depends on how far and how fast inflation comes down. So going into the spring, if you're at 5 percent, how far down do you need to get inflation before you say, okay, that's restrictive enough? It's an excellent point because typically monetary policy does operate with a lag. So the Fed wants to look ahead. And indeed, for example, Governor Waller and others have made reference to comparing the policy rate to where professional forecasters think inflation will be towards the end of the year. And I appreciate that point. My own research actually indicates that's a simple thing to do. I think the challenge they face, David, is that quite frankly the Fed's record at forecasting inflation has not been very good, including what I was there last year. And so I think it's going to be a balance between adjusting policy according to both the forecast and the incoming data. Richard, it's not just the rates that are going on. We also have so-called quantitative tightening as you try to run down the balance sheet, which had gone so far up. Give us your sense of what that is doing right now to financial conditions in the United States. Well, David, it is tightening conditions. Again, quantitative tightening is reversing quantitative easing. So the Fed's balance sheet is shrinking. Now, it's been very well telegraphed. And so markets certainly understand the pace and the modalities of tightening. But it is serving to tighten financial conditions. And that's consistent with what the Fed wants to do in terms of raising rates. So Richard, that takes us to a subject that I know you've heard a lot about. We read about all the time, which is perhaps a problem with liquidity in the treasury market. There's more volatility in the treasury market to understand it, but that's inherent in raising rates. The question is, is there additional volatility because there's not as much liquidity? We hear at least anecdotally that some people are having difficulty buying and selling large lots of treasuries. Yeah. Well, it's true. I went back and looked.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1256,2022-11-20 17:37:39
18643," We hear at least anecdotally that some people are having difficulty buying and selling large lots of treasuries. Yeah, well, it's true. I went back and looked. I had the privilege of 20 years ago of serving as assistant Treasury Secretary in 01 or 02. And in those years, debt outstanding was about $3 trillion, about 30% of GDP. This year, it's $23 trillion or 100% of GDP. So quite simply, the amount of debt outstanding and the amount of treasury issuance is vastly larger than it was 10 or 15 years ago. And the plumbing of the intermediation system for treasury says not really expanded can commonly with that. And so as a result, there is evidence on occasion of illiquidity in the market, certainly in extreme cases, as we observed in March of 2020 or September of 2019, it becomes even more evident. And so I think policymakers at the Fed and the Treasury and other agencies are looking at ways in which treasury market functioning can be improved. And I think it's certainly something that should be studied and improved. And what are possible options if they do conclude there's an issue there? One of the most supposed to be reversing and going back to quantitative easing, that's one way to do it. Another might be actually to ameliorating at least some of the restrictions in regulation and repose after the 2008 Great Financial Crisis, which really is an idea to took a lot of the big banks, and it limited their participation in the market. Well, it's right. And so I think that one of the things, David, that we did in the spring of 2020, is that we did relax, something called the supplementary leverage ratio, in the sense that we would not count bank reserves or treasury holdings against that leverage ratio. The idea is we wanted to encourage banks to lend in the pandemic shutdown. And the Fed indicated when it let those exemptions lapsed that it would begin, it would review whether or not it made sense to include treasuries and reserves in that leverage calculation. I'm sure that analysis is ongoing, but I think that's certainly something worth serious study. What is the rationale, actually, for the SLR? I don't not sure I understand it, because I would think the treasuries are as close to risk-free as possible. You know, the history of this is before the GFC, David, we had risk-based standards for banks. And so treasuries are not risky, other bonds are more risky. There was a sense broadly in the global community, not just in the U.S., but through the Basel process in Europe and Asia. Central Bank and policymakers agreed that it made sense to have a supplementary leverage ratio that typically would not be binding most of the time, but it could prevent, if you will, financial institutions from gaming and entirely risk-based system. However, you know, we discovered in March of 2020 the banks were in great shape. The banks were part of the solution, not part of the problem, and there can be perverse consequences of having a supplementary leverage ratio, especially when central banks are doing large amounts of key leagues. The creating reserves, which the system has to absorb. So I think it's certainly something that could address, and I think it could make a lot of sense. Rich, thank you so much for being on Wall Street. We go up to come back often. It's really good to have you. Yeah. Which would clear it up of PIMCO.

18644," Attitude, from its indulgence, a waste of time, almost an illness that needs a cure. For something as universally important to human life as sleep, mysteries surrounding its necessity and utility have only just been recently uncovered. Some of our biggest discoveries were in the 1970s or 1980s, and so it makes it a really exciting field, because it seems as though we're uncovering new insights each and every day. Some scientists are going further to find out how sleep and what happened there can be harnessed to further expand our understanding. It's easy to memorize things that makes you smart. If you can spit back a lot of facts, but if you want to be wise, if you really want wisdom, you got to know when and how and why to use that information. And that's what you bring figures out while you're sleeping. This is Wall Street Week. I'm David Weston. Welcome back now. Our special contributor, Larry Summers of a Harvard, to wrap up the week for us. Larry, thank you so much for being back with us. A lot of us spent a lot of the week actually trying to figure out where the Fed is headed, particularly where the terminal rate is. And we got conflicting, I think at least, somewhat conflicting answers out of the Fed, including with Mr. Bullard, the Fed president, saying, well, five, five and a quarter, and then put up a chart using the Taylor rule that suggested seven. Where are we? Look, no one knows. I think it's a mistake to be slavish about Taylor rules. The market thinks the number's going to be about five. I look at things and my sense is there's more room for that to be too low than there is for that to be too high. But it's pretty clear that we've had the big moves on this cycle. And now we're going to be finishing that process off. My view is that there's more risk from stopping prematurely and not really curing inflation and setting the stage up for a re-acceleration of inflation after it comes down. I see that as a bigger risk than going too far because going too far would mean bringing inflation down below 2%. And that still seems to me like an awfully remote risk starting from where we are. But I think that the Fed has this in the right place when it says that they're going to move up somewhat more and they're going to take stock of the situation and see what the inflation data is saying and seeing what the inflation forecasts are saying when we get to next get to the spring of next fall spring winter rather spring of next year. I have to say that if they hadn't made as many mistakes as they did of excessive optimism about inflation they'd probably have a little more room than they do to rely on forecasts that hadn't yet proved out that inflation was going to come down. Larry, you and I talk a lot about monetary policy, even fiscal stimulus and things, but geopolitics have also factored increasingly and some of the issues having to do with the economy. This week we had what is potentially, we don't know if it is, an important development in the meeting of President Xi of China and President Biden. What do you make of those discussions and even ongoing discussions because now we have the USTR, a madam tie actually meeting with the counterpart. What do you make of the situation with China right now in the United States? Look as Churchill famously said, George, George is a lot better than bang bang and so the fact that they had a meaningful conversation that lasted more than three hours, the fact that they both came out of the conversation with the sense that there had been satisfying dialogue, the sense that there are.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1258,2022-11-20 17:46:10
18645," three hours. The fact that they both came out of the conversation with the sense that there had been satisfying dialogue, the sense that there are some follow-on steps. I think that's all to the good. What it's really going to mean, what really is going to happen? Is there going to be constructive movement out of those dialogues? I think that's something we're going to have to wait and see. But I'm encouraged by what I saw. And I think it means that President Biden's whole trip has to be regarded as a success. The United States back in the game with respect to climate in Shammel Shake, the meeting with Jay. I don't think this G20 will be long remembered, but at a very vexing moment there could have been some kind of breakdown and there certainly was not that. Well, as a minimal thing, I've read some places, people say at least there is a G20. They came out with a joint community K and it was fairly tough on Russia, I think it's fair to say. And the reporting behind the scenes are that some of the developing countries like Indonesia and India help drive that process, which might, I don't want to overread it, suggest that maybe we're taking a half step back toward multilateralism? I think things, I think we are. I think that what Russia has done has really shocked the conscience of the world and has affected very, very many countries. We'll have to see how this plays out. I think we need to remain aware that in the original vote in the UN General Assembly, there were countries with more than half the world's population who have stained onto Russia's side, who declined to join in condemning Russia. So I think we've got a lot of work to do and we in the United States tend to be a bit over optimistic about the extent to which all others see us as the, in the benign way that we see ourselves. It's such an important point and it takes me back at least to China because it seems to me that sometimes we've been overly optimistic. I mean, for example, going back to the time we admitted into the WTO, we thought China was going to become more like us and then we go over the other extreme of being perhaps overly pessimistic about China. I guess my question for you is former Treasury Secretary among other things. How do we play both sides of that? We don't know how we'll end up. How do we keep open the realist possibly? We can really work closely with China but also protect ourselves against the possibility of confrontation. We in the United States probably need to be careful about our evangelizing influence. I don't think it's really for us to tell China how they should organize their entire society. I think it's for us to stand up for some of our fundamental interests in security, in fair economic competition, but to leave it at that point. I think we're going to need to be very careful with respect to our diplomacy on the issue of Taiwan. I think we need to be very careful about giving China the sense that we are trying to change the traditional one China policy because I think that could risk disastrous conflict. I think the operative words for us need to be respect for them, respect for positions and the fundamental interests that they have. At the same time, absolute insistence on our own. I would say one other thing, David, I think ultimately we will prevail in this broad contest with China. But I think if and when we prevail, it is going to be more than anything else on the strength of our example.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1259,2022-11-20 17:50:34
18646," If and when we prevail, it is going to be more than anything else on the strength of our example. And that's why domestic renewal at home, whether the issue is scientific innovation or infrastructure, whether the issue is doing something about opiate deaths or whether the issue is strengthening our education system, whether the issue is building on the greatness of our universities or the greatness of our national parks. Ultimately, it's going to be our ability to remain the country that's the envy of the world, the country to which people want to come that is going to determine our success. And if we change our focus from building ourselves up to tearing China down, I think we will be making a very risky and very unfortunate choice. Laura, I want to make a very large turn here. I've had the benefit of talking to you about the masters, about basketballs, I want to talk to about Taylor Swift. She's a rather popular pop music star and ticket master because we now know the Department of Justice is investigating possible and a trust problem there because of ticket master, which does after all have like a 70% market share that's been under investigation for some time. I don't know if you know much about Taylor Swift, although I am concerned about you getting tickets, which apparently seems to be difficult, but more broadly, what is it say perhaps about some of the problems with over concentration in the economy? You know, I want to say two things about that, David. The first is that if the government made a website that functioned as badly as ticket masters has here, everybody would be laughing and scorning the government. And so the next time the private sector says that, you know, the public sector can't do anything right. This was a private sector building a website, sort of like that, to build a website for Obamacare, sort of like they have to build websites at the IRS, or like they have to build a build websites for student loan debt relief. And the private sector utterly failed. And that's something that we just have to remember the next time somebody wants to say everything about government is hopeless. Yeah, we are a humble one. We have faith trust. Larry, we're going to have to leave it there. I'm so sorry. We're a humble. We have much to be humble about. Larry, thank you so very much. It's Larry. Some of us are very special contributors here on Wall Street Week. Coming up, a lot of people get hurt when there's a collapse like that of FTX, but who stands to benefit? Yeah. I think that it's hard to put your head around any narrative. Like just be honest, we've had sort of a shift in, are we in some sort of circulation fears? The moment people were talking about that all day, yesterday. What does it mean when the White House says we're watching markets carefully? I've seen a Bloomberg. I've seen it.

18648," Kenny Beats was a music obsessed team who already played multiple instruments when he finally picked up an NPC. Through a confluence of inspiration and perspiration, in no time he'd find himself in the studio with major artists, attending one of the most prestigious music schools and even blowing up as an EDM DJ, all before he would re-emerge back in hip-hop, carving his own lane. His fluidity as a producer has allowed him to work across multiple genres and collaborate with everyone from Doja Cat to Freddie Gibbs, and through his beloved YouTube series The Cave, at a massive footprint on Discord and Twitch, he's created a uniquely interactive digital community, and it all started with one idea. How did your parents' professional life inform your ambitions? I was an only child and both my parents worked. My dad worked two jobs and I was a kid, and my mom worked like eight to six type of hours. I had a lot of time by myself, had a lot of time to figure out what interest me as a kid. Your dad was a fairly accomplished basketball player. Played pro in Europe, yeah? Did any of that inform how you thought about competition or any other parts of life? I've seen my dad shoot a million jump shots. I've seen my dad on so many Saturdays and Sundays when I was a kid after he worked all day and week, like go to the YMCA and I would just sit there with like action figures at four years old and my dad would shoot a thousand free throws. All those hours my dad spent doing the thing he loved, it always gave me this bar for how bad do I want something. I still kind of think about that to this day of just what's the difference between when I work nine to five, five days a week, and when I go 14 hours a day for a month, and that's from 25 to 30, when I really started gunning it and I really started shooting a thousand shots a day, my career went completely different. And my dad was very eclectic and even though he's this basketball guy, music's where my dad loves. My family would go to dinner party or somebody's house. My parents wouldn't bring a bottle of wine or like dessert. My dad would bring a cassette and he would give people these cassettes that would be like songs from the radio, those songs he thinks they would like and then in between he would talk and he would do this fake radio show. And last year my dad got cancer and I got all of the cassettes and I just started listening to all of them. You hear me as a kid, you hear my dad, you hear me imitating my dad. Hey, this one goes out to all the lonely people out there. I'm five and so I just got into the sound of it. So I started putting everything on cassette for a moment last year and like when you hear like sundown town, I've been staples and so that's like stuff we put on cassette intentionally to feel nostalgic because it just does something to me. What was the inspiration that made you pick up the guitar when you're nine years old and start playing? My godfather, my dad's best friend, took me to mannies in the city on 48th, bought me a guitar, took me to Michael Jordan's stay-couse and grand central while we stay. Just the end of my life, changed my whole life, started playing guitar that night, never stopped. Didn't matter if my parents were home or what they were doing, what was going on, like I was just always making music all the time. My parents loved music in a way that I felt like even me being 67 and playing basketball or like getting really good grades or whatever, I couldn't get as much of a reaction out of my parents as if I played something really good in guitar. So I feel like that made me want to get good at it. So how are you learning? If you just search the guitar tab any song, they would come up and it would say, this string, this number on the fret and I would go, okay, fifth string, fifth fret, and I would figure out a chord over a half hour. I didn't have a guitar teacher, and they made me, I would just try to play songs that my dad liked. My dad would sit there after work and listen to me suck at guitar, so loud, and that was how I formed my musical mind. That's how I started playing instrument. How did you make the leap from playing guitar, messing around with live drum kits to getting on drum machine and starting to make beats? As years went by, guitar wasn't impressive in my friends. And so I started trying to make beats and I remember playing my one friend that's like, you should beat ride completely stolen from this farrell, or sorry, a Timbo video. Timbo did this beat for Brandy, and I stole the whole beat and remade it in Garage Band. And my friends were the most impressive unit I ever met.

Did they know that you would rip off Timbo? No, no, no, there's a brandy. What are you doing in this kid's from Connecticut? I'm literally like playing them this beat. I stole verbatim and everyone's like, you made this? That was enough, right there. That made me go, I need to make beats. Beats were the thing that I can relate to my friends with. And to this day, my barometer is that my friends love it. That makes me still have the most adrenaline, not Twitter engagement. If all my friends think I'm whack and I'm top 10 on Billboard, you're gonna wake up every day feeling lame. This is my first beat machine. This is the first thing I was making beats on. This is my NPC 1000. I was making beats like this because every time I would see someone making beats, I would see just blaze, he had one of these. I would see dilley, he had one of these. This was my first experience with like picking drum sounds, picking samples. Where was the technology? Because in the 90s, there was this huge chasm between the Dr. Dre's and even people like EasyMopies and Sir Janks. And the sounds that they could get out of their NPCs and their machines versus what, for example, me and my friends could get out of an NPC. Were you able to get almost like professional level sounds from the beginning? That's like the thing I'm always trying to explain to people. You had the network just to get drums that were of semi-professional level. And my space was kind of what Reddit and Discord and all these things are now where I was messaging hip boy at 16 years old with my beats and just being like, yo, please listen to these. He had like a pussy cat doll's placement and was like working with Polo the Don and stuff. And I was really messaging hip boy and chasing cash, non-stop trying to just get them to hear my beats and chase and him both would respond to be like, your ideas are cool, your drums are trash. And I remember like being like, oh, he's right. And I was listening to their drums and a couple months later someone sent me a kit. And I heard a snare in that kit that I knew from like some fabulous song. And I was like, oh, my God. Now it's the opposite. Now you can get anything if a song from Uzi comes out yesterday. The snare is on Reddit tomorrow for free. So these kids who are 15 now look at me and they're like, I'm the elder statesman of current production. But the technology like evolving has made it so easy now for kids to jump that learning curve. And someone could take what those five years took me and learn it on YouTube and Reddit and Discord and a month. In 2022, someone who is sitting down to make music for the first time, what I would tell them is put as much stuff as your computer can fit on your computer, which means sounds, samples, any type of idea you can get from anywhere, whether it's Reddit or a site like Splace or whatever. When you sit down and make music, if you have more cool things to pick from, more things that sound really good, it's going to start you off with confidence. You might, by chance, end up on something you love faster. What did it feel like the first time you heard someone rap on your beats? His name is Sean Bucks. I live the couple of towns over for me. I recorded him when my dad's closet. It's 15 years old. And then there was this thing called AIM. I don't know if you remember. Yeah. Well, it's the messenger. It's big on him. I sent every single person on my buddy list a song. When people hated on it, some people loved it. But I remember it wasn't when I first heard him rap on it. I got to school and one of my friends was playing it out of their car. And something I made with a rapper on it was playing out of somebody's car. Even to this day, there's no check I've gotten since then that felt like that felt. What I tell people now with the stuff that we do for producers, one day of someone getting a bunch of comments, a bunch of love, a confidence boost, that could be all you need for five years. That could be enough for that person who's teetering with, should I keep going with music or should I go get a job or should I leave this safety net of my job? And go pursue this thing I love. It's like, if a hundred people all tell you you're amazing, you're going to do it. What were you listening to at that time? With my friends, G unit, and then at home, like Willie Nelson, Shade, any classic rock you can think of, my dad liked the chronic as much as he liked.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1263,2022-11-20 18:11:28
18650," This is GUNIT and then at home, like Willie Nelson, Shade, any classic rock you can think of. My dad liked the chronic as much as he liked when he used to. And at what point did you sort of take what you're learning here, listening to these records with your father and start thinking about applying it to the music that you're listening to with your friends? Probably not till after Berkeley. Really? Like no, I wasn't even playing guitar on my beats till I was like 24. And I played guitar, so I was nine. Made beats, so I was 15. I kind of kept these worlds separate and then it got to be me being in studios in 1920 whatever and I'd pick up a guitar and play a guitar and someone would be like, you play guitar? Everybody starts telling me, you should be playing on your beats, you should be incorporating this stuff. And whenever I used to think, how can I make the best beat that sounds like the radio never worked. When I started just being myself and like living all these influences in my music, people started saying, that's crazy, that sounds awesome. So this is your sound. Took me so long to realize that like, it's all music. I just got to this moment a couple of years ago where I wanted to start from scratch more often. Taking a day to just make drum sounds or play a bunch of guitars through a bunch of different pedals or try stuff in my program. Like the next time I'm with an artist, my vocabulary is just so much wider. So say I get in that position and I'm with someone I'd love to work with, new artist, big artists and they say, today let's make flamenco. Today let's do something Brazilian. I got a chord change. I got a sound I can reach for, I got a drum kit. Prior to going to school, you start to meet people in the real music industry, Johnny Shibes in particular. How are you even making these introductions or getting into these circles? There was a producer and he had gone to my high school one point and he was now producing for Snoop and working with Ryan Leslie and Out Now Lay doing all these big sessions. His name is Alex Sanzo. Alex just took me under his wing and he would drive me to the city every day and go to the studio on 48th where they would give him studio time. I would go to the studio and meet time I could after work, after school, whenever Alex would pick me up, I'd go with Alex to the studio. In some days I didn't press a single button. I was basically his runner and other days him and I would make beats together. I met Nipsey in that studio. I met Currency in that studio. I met French Montana in that studio. I met Johnny Shibes who I would intern for in that studio. This is me at 17, 18 years old. I would go to these managers and these ancillary people who I would see that were always tagged by the artists or always in the pictures with the artists and I would hit them up and say, do you need any help? Is there anything I can do? I sell weed, I make beats. Is there anything that you need? It was always about creating value and that turned into years later learning to engineer which turned into years later now recording whole bands and doing the things I'm doing now. I just try to make sure that my skill set or what I'm bringing to the table is more than the person next to me so I'll get the job. I hit Johnny in the DMs and I just said, is there anything I can do? And he gave me an address. I met them there the next day. I brought all my beats, all my weed, all my resume points with me and that night I got a placement for a song called Continental Cushure Breakfast with Smoke Dizzah and then Johnny said, yeah, you're my intern now and I was his first intern. The days where Johnny was too busy for me to come intern, he would send me to this building called DD172 that Dame Dash was running and I would go on my off days and help out at Dame Dash's spot. What was it like being around Dame as a 18 year old in that moment? Wild. I grew up on Dipset and Rockefeller and I grew up on Jay-Z and all these things and you know who Dame is. Being around somebody like that who is so influential in your childhood even, it just makes you feel like it's painted out. Just hearing Dame Dash yell next to you about some architecture or like some like big record that's gonna come out or whatever, I'm like, I'm in this room. And all this was unpaid, I assume, completely unpaid for many, many years and even all my first beats went completely unpaid. When you're doing this internship, did you explicitly know that you wanted to be a producer or did you just know sort of broadly, I wanna work in music or in the music industry? I wanted to be a producer and I didn't...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1264,2022-11-20 18:15:51
18651," Listically know that you wanted to be a producer or did you just know sort of broadly? I want to work in music or in the music industry. I wanted to be a producer and I didn't think people were just going to give me a shot to play beat so I was like if I'm the intern and everybody likes me or I'm the person who's helping the man job all the time and I get in cool with everybody and I got the best weed. Sooner or later I'm going to play a beat and that's what happened and I played that first beat and got a placement and then that person introduced me to Yams, who introduced me to Rocky, who introduced me to A-Rab music or introduced me to, and it just that's how it went when I was younger. In my career I attribute a ton of things to look because I don't really understand how else they could have happened. I'm a white kid from Connecticut who makes rap music. There's so many things that I wasn't supposed to get a shot to do that people gave me an opportunity to do. I just try to work my hardest at everything that's put in front of me to do the best I can.

Following a commitment to his parents to pursue higher education, he left behind the connections he had forged in New York and headed to the Berkeley College of Music in Boston. A world-class institution for music, the school equipped Kenney with vital information for his craft. But it also isolated him from opportunity. Or at least that's what he thought at first. Before long, he'd find a way to flip the situation in his favor. You have this natural momentum. You're starting to make moves. You haven't quite got to the place where you're really making music per se, but you're making the connections. You can feel that things are breaking in the way that you want them to. Yeah. After high school, you decide that you want to go to Berkeley school music. Were your parents supportive of this? To be real, yeah, I wouldn't have gone to school if it was up to me. My one thing with my mom was you are going to go to college and you are going to graduate college. And that was a thing since I was five. I remember I had this session and Yams came and Yams asked me for some beats. He called me like a couple days later and was like, we're using these and I was like going to orientation the day after. And I remember leaving and being like, Rocky is about to get on my beats. My favorite rapper, the hottest artist in New York City, maybe the world in this moment. And I'm about to go do orientation with these assholes. Like I was so mad because I really was in the thick of it. But I had this weird little island in Boston where yeah, I'm going to school.

18653," Looking to capitalize on EDM's surgeon popularity, Kenny teamed up with fellow DJ Ryan Marks and the duo formed LoudPak. On the back of Kenny's musical virtuosity and Ryan's deep connections to the scene, the group found near immediate success, booking prominent remixes and hundreds of live shows. What was the nature of sort of the creative partnership between you and Ryan? He was the informational side of the day. He taught me about electronic music, what the sounds were, how people produce those songs, you need to build up here, you need to ensure here that intro has to be just drums so you can mix songs into it. And I was just kind of like a production nut and it would make anything, I have a million sounds I could do whatever. So you point me in any direction, I would just go. How did you feel about actually being a performer? It taught me so much about the music I'm making in real life. You're not playing just your songs at these shows. I'll play a Travis song into a Daff Punk song into maybe a thing I made into something else. You're just trying to make people emote. When you go back in the studio and you realize what worked, what didn't, what was the lowest point in the crowd, what was it? It teaches you so much about pop. It teaches you about songwriting. It teaches you about arrangement. I started looking at music with a bird's eye view. How are people going to hear this when it leaves this room? How is this going to fit in these 10 songs? I think live shows and sets gave me that. But then years into it, I started feeling this disconnect of, I never grew up listening to Scrillics. I'm not someone who, you know what I mean, has Daff Punk posters on my wall. This isn't what I feel in my heart the way I do when I work on rap stuff or work on pop stuff or anything else. So that's the embarrassment of talking about it now. It's like I feel like I was faking the funk for a couple of years. I was kind of just doing the thing that worked instead of fighting the good fight to do the thing that like, I feel in my heart, I feel my stomach. The biggest professional L I've taken is spending years doing something. I wasn't wholeheartedly invested in. Looking back on it, I wish that there were certain moments where I only focused on what I love, what my friends love, what makes me want to cry, what makes me want to scream instead of the check. Years before La Pact stopped and the public doesn't know this. But years before I stopped DJing, I was trying to start doing the Kenny thing. And I wasn't actively doing a lot of sessions or sending beat packs out. But I was saying to my team and to the people around me and my friends, I think I want to get back to making beats. I think I want to get back to like working with artists instead of being an artist. The way people I was working with at the time reacted to it, I just knew it wasn't it. In that four year period, you guys reached a certain level of a claim. You got the drums on the Beaver record, you got the Chainsmokers, Remix, that was huge. And you built a brand in La Pact. Was it hard in any way for you to walk away from having put all of that blood sweat and tears into building something that had that resonance? Not for a second. I've never listened to one of those songs since the day I shut the social media down. Not once. I worked back on four or five years of making music and I'm like, I don't like this music. But this is who I am now. This is how people know me. It's not Kenny Beats, the young kid who did that Kendrick beat. It's you who are DJ. You know what I mean? For me to not only flip the music I'm making, go out on my own for the first time really. Try to do rap production. You know what I mean after this many years later, it felt insurmountable. And it was like the hardest moment. I was in huge debt from commissions I owed. My father was in a coma, he had overdosed. And when I was at my lowest, lowest of lows of my entire life, my best friends started managing me. Look at me in my face that you're going to be one of the biggest producers. You're going to be a great legendary producer. I know it. Why do the biggest names in business choose Bloomberg? It's a great question. It's a great question. Great question. I get all night.

Hydrogen has a very special place in the universe. It's the first element on the periodic table. It is the most abandoned element in the universe. And when clean energy advocates think about what can we find, which would be as easy to use, as fossil fuels they think about hydrogen. The fuel that will, when burned, only produce water. We like to imagine that if we just built enough of these and these, we could ditch fossil fuels and save the planet. Unfortunately, it's not that simple. There are some things where you just need a good old-fashioned combustible fuel. Now startups around the world are betting that hydrogen can become the fuel of the 21st century. Kenny was down, but not out. He knew the type of music that he didn't want to be making, but now he had to figure out how to break back into the music that he did want to make. So he immersed himself in the culture, tapped into his network, and just started working. It wasn't overnight, but eventually he would not only become one of the most sought-after producers in hip-hop, but an innovator within music's digital ecosystem. So you come to this point of inflection that he describes as a low point, and you decide to pivot and go back to making hip-hop beats and being a hip-hop producer. What is step one, day one, to start building towards that? You know nothing. That's what I would tell myself. My production, technical ability, was better than it had ever been in my life, and I started trying to make rap beats again, and they just felt stale. I knew they weren't right. I knew the drums didn't hit right. I knew the energy wasn't there, and step one was just learning. I invited anybody and everybody to this horrible little studio I was renting, and like some weird area in Burbank, that was the cave. I became the cave. And I just tried to re-educate myself, and a lot of the time it's me who's co-produced with Skrillex and done all this big boy stuff, learning from a 17-year-old who doesn't know how to do like the most basic thing in production, but they are the sound right now. They know something I don't know. I had to see it in front of me from the people who are really doing it. And to enter back into the scene, I didn't want to feel like I was playing people fake versions of something that they really wanted. I wanted to make the closest to the real thing, and I had to start from square one. I love to learn almost to a fault. I'm obsessed with just being the student. I'm obsessed with being the dumbest person in the room. I'm watching a YouTube tutorial when I'm going to take a piss, and then when I lie down at night, I've got to read three things about some gear. Trust me, it's hurt relationships in my life. It's done a lot of things that aren't positive, but I want to cover my blind spots.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1268,2022-11-20 18:33:15
18655," Three things about some gear, trust me, it's hurt relationships in my life, it's done. A lot of things that aren't positive, but I want to cover my blind spots. When one looks at your discography, it's kind of like an exponential growth that happens from like 2016 to 2018. You go from having a handful of placements to having like 75 placements in 2018. How did you engineer that? That model I was just speaking about never stopped for years. Anybody who wanted to come make music would come make music. And I was at that studio 16 hours a day. As artists started to want to work with me and they knew they could come work for free, I'll make any beat you want to make. There's always some to drink some food, some weed there, and it's 24 or seven anytime you want. As long as there's no one else there, it became a place where key got really comfortable. Rico got really comfortable. Freddie Gibbs got really comfortable. Vince started coming by all the time. You know what I mean? Things that didn't feel like the biggest things back then. But now when I tell the story, now when I say it was undercat left, right before young Dolph got there, right before Doja Cat was leaving or something, it just kept going. And you got to the point where I'm doing 20 songs in a week. How are you financing this? How are you staying afloat? At first, there was a moment where I had less than $1,000 to my name. And I have a studio that costs about that much in rent. I have an apartment, I have a car, I got, I help my family, I got phone bills, whatever. Don't have enough money to even pay this one month worth of stuff. And I would go to my business manager who think of it. I have a business manager. I have someone I'm paying 5% of everything to manage my business and I have a thousand bucks. But those people put me in a situation to where I could build from there and where I could get out of that hole and where I could, they believed in me so much and what I was going to do that you got to understand. And me not taking money for these beats or these studio sessions, think about my lawyer, think about my business manager, think about my manager, they're doing contracts for 50, 60, 100 songs that are making no money. No hard that is to convince a lawyer who's making millions of dollars a year to do my contracts that aren't going to make you sh** through that whole period. Getting back on my feet wasn't as much the concern financially as it was career wise. I just needed to keep making songs and I just knew that. And then there were these moments where you don't get paid on beats, you don't get paid on beats, you don't get paid on beats, you do a whole album. You get paid for 10 beats, you know what I mean? And even if you're only making 5K of beat, $50,000 for me in that year is life changing money. $50,000 for most people watching this is life changing money. How did you decide that you wanted to start moving in that collaborative full album zone? And were you having those conversations with the artist at the front door or was it kind of like, well we just made 15 amazing songs. So it was never at the front door. And it's never something that I think of or bring up to this day. The first time it happened, I had made so many songs with someone that they said, all right, this is a U and me project. I'm going to wear the Kenny from South Park hoodie on the cover and I was just like, wait, what the f**k? First of all, don't wear that hoodie. But second of all, my name is going on the project. I remember calling Mike and being like, you know, they said, it's my project too. And my name's going to be on. I'd never even fathom that. Now looking back on it, so many producers who have 10 times more Drake Kanye, whatever giant placements than me, they come to me and they say, how do you do those full projects? How do you end up getting your name tagged on Spotify as an artist with the artist? Like, it doesn't make sense to people. Rico did it. Freddie and Lambo, when they put out that project, they put my name in every press blast. When I did FM for Vince, Vince had headlines and Rolling Stone and everywhere. Vince Staples and Liss, Kenny Beats, that did it. Sometimes people have taken care of that for me and just put my name along with all the other important info they send out. And I think the reason is because people have found a home and these places we're working and these albums we're working on, they're seeing me every day for months talking about everything in their life, everything in my life. And we're making all these songs. When the project finishes, I think people have put it in my head almost that, this is your project too, because I still will never say that. And if you've made people feel like...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1269,2022-11-20 18:37:28
18656," Project finishes, I think people have put it in my head almost that this is your project too, because I still will never say that. And if you've made people feel like you're really helping them out or feel really excited about what they're doing, they're going to try to do it for you and a lot of artists have done it for me. They've showcased my charisma through their platforms and that's led me to having a fan base. How do you think about creating that environment and setting that table for artists? I want to set people up to where when they say something on the mic, they love how they sound. Whenever they walk into the room, they just love everything they're looking at in every corner, whether it's my action figures and cool little synths and custom painted stuff and whatever it is, or if it's just having their best friends around. I try to figure that out as fast as possible, along with the engineering side. Everybody hates how they sound. When I listen back to this interview, I'm going to go, oh, that's my voice. When anybody hears himself on a voicemail, they go, that's what I sound like. Artists feel the same way. A del feels like that. You have to understand that setting up someone to feel cool or sexy or talented or smart or whatever can unlock something in creative geniuses that is unparalleled. You know what I mean? It's like if you can make someone feel like they're really good at what they're doing, they're going to do things you never even knew they could do. Do you have a tried and true process to creating songs or do you have to adapt to each artist? It's completely different every time. The only thing that I would say is my process every time with every artist is just questions. What do you love right now? What are you listening to? What's your favorite thing you've made recently? What's up with the outside of music? Those four questions can get you really far. As a producer, you sort of have to balance on the one hand being an artist yourself. On the other hand, coaching a highly sensitive person. How do you navigate that? I'm a highly sensitive person too. I think I understand it. I work with so many people whose minds are not normal and that's why their art is not normal and their songs are so f***ing good because they're not like everybody else. I used to worry that me having so much charisma or me and Zach Foxx making a joke or doing a YouTube show or the cave would keep someone like Twigs or someone who is this unique artist who doesn't work with everybody from wanting to work with me. I realized it was kind of the opposite. I just navigate all that kind of stuff by not thinking of it as networking or not thinking of it as how do we get to the song? I just have a conversation with this person and get along. If you can get along with somebody, you can make a record with them. Most important part of my creative routine, conversation, I'll go into a week thinking, this is how I'm looking at music, this is what I want to make, this is the point of what I'm making, this is who I want to work with. One conversation with someone else will completely shift how I go into the studio that day. One conversation with one of my friends where I play them a song and they say a good or bad thing about it. One artist playing me, their favorite new thing completely shifts what sound I'm going to reach for, what instrument I'm going to pick up, what chords I'm going to play. That's what gets me going and excited and inspired and through the creative blocks is somebody who I think is great saying something to me that I haven't thought of. 2018, you get a ton of placements. In 2019, you really seem to consciously pivot your brand to the forefront of how you were presenting and you start the cave and the twitch and the discord. Was there a light bulb moment that you made that conscious switch? My friends are really smart. Like I said, my best friend is my manager and don't over think, sh** is a company of my five best friends. We do clothing, we do designs, we do shows, we do live events, we run digital communities like the second biggest discord in music. These people create that value around me where I'm a music guy. If I told you that something like the cave or treatments for music videos or artwork for albums were things that crossed my mind all the time, I'd be lying to you. Having a team of people around me allowed me to be so much more than what they allow producers to be.

18657," need to be so much more than what they allow producers to be. When my cool homies became my business partners, Kenny Beats went like this. I'm 30 right now. The last five years of my life have been the best five years of my life. I've done things I could never accomplish. And that's not just with Beats and with music, it's helping my friends, helping my family start in a company, you know what I mean? With my homies and doing great things for people who make music. It's all like uncharted territory. Tell me the story of how Discord gets presented to you and how do they sell you on it. I think the first time it even comes into frame for me is random DMs from supporters or fans just being like, yo, Kenny, come into this Discord. And that's the first time I saw the name. And there's a lot of things you'll see when you go on that app that are just categories. There's a musician's Discord. It's crazy to say the Kenny Beats Discord's bigger than the musician's Discord at this point. But when we got on there, people were just like, yo, come on this website. Then Mike came to me and Mike goes, all right, well, you know, everybody, if you have a Twitch, you start the Discord with the Twitch. And basically the idea is all the people who are watching you stream all the time and are really interested in that community or the cave, this would be like a place for them to go, 24-7, and maybe they could start their own little shows or little things together, collaborate or whatever. It's just, that was how it was presented. I have 123,000 people in there as we're talking. It's crazy. I've had that many producers. I can ask a question too right now. This hive mind now is a true kind of power. And it's a different kind of platform than my other social media. Kids have gotten signed to major labels without paying me a single dollar all because everyone in the Discord said they're hot. This was one kid, 16 years old, DVR. He made four demos on a version of Ableton, the free version. He didn't pay for it. He can't even save your work. He made four songs. He put them in the Discord. Hundreds of kids said this kid's the one, this kid's the one. I'm getting calls from Polly Doer, from Excel Records, from Atlantic. Kids signed to Excel Records. He's on the same label as Adele and Radio Head and all this stuff. And he came out of the Discord, made some free songs. When people see that, that's power. How has the implementation of these sort of more community or media products transformed the business of Kenny Beats? The business of Kenny Beats changed whenever we had a digital community with YouTube or Discord where we're showing 700,000 people followed by YouTube the first year I started it. Like our Discord became the second biggest Discord in the music category, the year we started it. I've now become a person where if you're having a label meeting about technology for young musicians, I'm in the Convo. If you want to talk about it in just regular layman's terms, the bags that come across our desk now are to consult for a major company or to come in and help someone review products to see if people in the music-making landscape are gonna really react to this because they know that hive mind is sitting in a Discord with my name on it. So we need to look at 2022, 2022, 23, where are the goals that you have? Help as many people as far away as possible, get excited and inspired. I wanna make sure that along with continuing my personal path of making more music, making better songs, making great art, I help more people make more art. And I used to think my goal was just making the best songs, you know, and these last couple of years, like all these things we're talking about have started to spiral into something where you think, what can you really do for music? Is it just add another song to the board? Cause I love music, it's all I ever wanna do, it's as much my hobby as my job. I'm gonna do it even when I'm not working. I'm never gonna be businessman, Tony Robbins, Gary V. Kenney, you know what I mean? And then talk about when I used to make records. I'll make records till I die, but I wanna give that feeling to as many people as possible. When the price of anything goes up, the consequences reach far beyond what you'd expect. But perhaps most of all, when it comes to food. In 2010, surging food prices help spark the Arab Spring. Lives were lost, regimes fell, and the consequences are still with us.

18658," rising and fast. Energy costs, broken supply chains, and surging demand were just some of the factors that have driven food prices to their first record high since the Arab Spring. And that's all before a war between two of the world's biggest food producers. Ukraine is called the Bread Basket of Europe, and taken with Russia the two account for about a quarter of global wheat trade. It produced more than half of the world's sunflower seeds in oil, nearly 20% of the barley. Now throw in rising energy prices and processing, transporting, even refrigerating food gets more expensive. Plus, fertilizer production is extremely energy intensive. Less fertilizer means lower crop yield, and prices rise even more. The pandemic revealed how complicated and fragile global trade systems are. Global agriculture, perhaps even more so. Unlike metals, for example, food goes bad. And crops take months to grow and are vulnerable to unpredictabilities like the weather. Rising food prices will be felt everywhere, but the poorest countries in the world will be hit the hardest. And as all these factors compound, the real fear is that record high will lead to record high and ultimately to a global food crisis with vast consequences. You will shed light on dark matter.

This is Jeff Hinton. Because of a back condition, he hasn't been able to sit down for more than 12 years. I hate standing. I was much rather sit-time, but if I sit down, I have a distance that comes up. So, well, at least now, standing desks are fashionable. Yeah, but I was the head. I was standing when they were professionals. Since he can't sit in the car or on a bus, Hinton walks everywhere. The walk says a lot about Hinton and his resolve. For nearly 40 years, Hinton has been trying to get computers to learn like people do. A quest almost everyone thought was crazy, or at least hopeless. Right up until the moment, it revolutionized the field. Google thinks this is the future of the company. Amazon thinks the future of the company. Apple thinks it's the future of the company. My own department thinks this does probably nonsense and we shouldn't be doing any more of it. So I took everybody into it except my own department. You obviously grew up in the UK and you had this very prestigious family full of famous mathematicians and economists. I was curious what it was like for you. Yeah, there was a lot of pressure. I think by the time I was about seven, I realised I was going to have to get a PhD. Did you rebel against that? Or you went along? I dropped out of yourself. Yeah, I became a cop into for a while. Hinton pretty early on became obsessed with this idea of figuring out how the mind works. He started off getting into physiology, the anatomy of how the brain works, then he got into psychology, and then finally he settled on more of a computer science approach to modeling the brain and got into artificial intelligence. My feeling is if you want to understand a really complicated device like a brain, you should build one. I mean you could look at cars and you could think you could understand cars. When you try and build a car, you suddenly discover there's this stuff that has to go under the hood otherwise it doesn't work. As Jeff was starting to think about these ideas, he got inspired by some AI researchers across the pond. Specifically this guy, Frank Rosenblatt. Rosenblatt in the late 1950s, developed what he called a perceptron and it was a neural network, a computing system that would mimic...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1272,2022-11-20 18:50:27
18659," in the late 1950s. Developed what he called a perceptron, and it was a neural network, a computing system that would mimic the brain. The basic idea is a collection of small units called neurons. These are little computing units, but they're actually modeled on the way that the human brain does its computation. They take incoming data like we do from our senses, and they actually learn so the neural net can learn to make decisions over time. Rosenblatt's hope was that you could feed a neural network a bunch of data like pictures of men and women, and it would eventually learn how to tell them apart, just like humans do. There was just one problem. It didn't work very well. Rosenblatt, his neural network was a single layer of neurons, and it was limited in what it could do, extremely limited. And a colleague of his wrote a book in the late 60s that showed these limitations. And it kind of put the whole area of research into a deep freeze for a good 10 years. No one wanted to work in this area, and they were sure it would never work. Well, almost no one. It was just obvious to me that it was the right way to go. The brains of big neural network, and so it has to be that stuff like this can work because it works in our brains. It's just never any data about that. And what do you think it was inside of you that kept you wanting to pursue this when everyone else was giving up, just that you thought it was the right direction to go? No, did everybody else was wrong? OK. Hinton, besides, he's got an idea of how these neural nets might work. And he's going to pursue it no matter what. For a little while, he's bouncing around research institutions in the US. He kind of gets fed up that most of them are funded by the defense department, and he starts looking for somewhere else he can go. I didn't want to take defense to bottom money. I sort of didn't like the idea that this stuff was going to be used for purposes that I didn't think were good. He suddenly hears the Canada might be interested in funding artificial intelligence. And that was very attractive. But I could go off to this civilized town and just get on with it. So I came to the University of Toronto. And then in the mid-80s, we discovered how to make more complicated neural nets so they could solve those problems that the simple ones couldn't solve. Key and his collaborators developed a multi-layer neural network, a deep neural network. And this started to work in a lot of ways. Using a neural network, a gunning Dean Palmerloo built a self-driving car in the late 80s, and it drove on public roads. John Lacoon, in the 90s, built a system that could recognize handwritten digits, and this ended up being used commercially. But again, they hit a ceiling. It didn't work quite well enough, because we didn't have enough data, we didn't have enough compute power. And people in AI and computer science decided neural networks was wishful thinking basically. So it was a big disappointment. Through the 90s, into the 2000s, Jeff was one of only a handful of people on the planet who are still pursuing this technology. He would show up at academic conferences and be banished to the back rooms. He was treated as really like a pariah. Was there like a time when you thought this just wasn't going to work, and you didn't have some self-doubt? I mean, either many times I thought, I'm not going to make this work. But Jeff was consumed by this and couldn't stop. He just kept pursuing the idea that computers could learn until about 2006 when the world catches up to Hinton's ideas. Computers would unlock fossil. And now it's behaving like I thought it would behave in the mid-80s, it's solving everything. The arrival of super fast chips.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1273,2022-11-20 18:54:47
18660," Computer would not allow fossil. And now it's behaving like I thought it would behave in the mid-80s, it's solving everything. The arrival of super fast chips and the massive amounts of data produced on the internet gave Hinton's algorithms a magical boost. Suddenly computers could identify what was in an image. Then they could recognize speech and translate from one language to another. By 2012, words like neural nets and machine learning were popping up on the front page of the New York Times. You have to go all these years and then all of a sudden, you know, in this span of a few months, it just takes off and then it finally feels like, aha, you know, the world has finally come to my vision. It's sort of a relief that people finally came to their senses. For Hinton, this was clearly a redemptive moment after decades of toil. And for Canada, it meant something even bigger. Hinton and his students put the country on the map as an AI superpower. Something no one and no computer could ever have predicted.

While Tesla's in the like make for good headlines, the reality is that even if every car on the road today won electric, it wouldn't be enough to curb global emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions from transportation account for about 29% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. So what about the other 71%? Buildings across America burn fossil fuels to operate. What we want to do is make that all electric. Instead of burning oil and gas to give us the energy and electricity we need, we want to do 100% clean energy, all electric. We want to turn buildings into Tesla's. Just like a Tesla or an electric vehicle is all electric with no fossil fuels. We can do it in all buildings and if we do it in all buildings, we'll reduce 30% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Japan's critical role in the global economy is changing as the world recalibrates.

So what's the best investment advice you've ever been given by anybody? The compound interest, the compounding of returns is an incredible miracle of business, finance and human existence. Everything you learn is additive every day and if you keep added and don't quit, it's an incredible miracle. And it's not just interest. It was always said above compound interest returns, compound business returns, compound human returns. They're all very additive because you'll learn every day and if you keep at it, it's very, very helpful. In your observation of investors, what do you think is the biggest mistake that average investors make? Selling at the wrong time. And they sell when the prices go down? Yes, or yes. Not keeping. But people have conviction or if they invest for the right reasons, just keep at it. No one covers the world like Bloomberg.

This is my kitchen table and also my filing system. Over much of the past three decades, I've been an investor. The highest calling of mankind I've often thought was private equity. And then I've started interviewing. Well, I watch your interviews because I know how to do some interviews. I've learned in doing my interviews how leaders make it to the top.

You don't feel inadequate now because being only the second wealthiest man in the world is that right? One of the president's closest advisors is Jake Sullivan. He was the national security advisor and the second youngest person to hold that job at the age of 43. I sat down with him recently here in the executive office building to discuss a wide range of international issues and national security issues affecting the president and our country. So let me get right to the heart of Ukraine if I get asked you. Is there any chance of a resolution in Ukraine matter any time in the foreseeable future, any possibility of a truce or some kind of agreement that you think could end this war in the next few months or so? You never say never. There's always a chance. And we've been clear from the beginning that we would support a diplomatic solution that vindicated Ukraine's right to sovereignty and territorial integrity. But the odds of it in the next few months I think are quite low. On China, the president of the United States has not met with Xi Jinping for COVID-related reasons. But there isn't possibility. They might meet in the upcoming G20 meeting. Do you have any plans to have an agreement or any kind of proposed settlements of any issues that are now ongoing?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1275,2022-11-20 19:03:34
18662," In the upcoming G20 meeting, do you have any plans to have a agreement or any kind of proposed settlements of any issues that are now ongoing between the two countries, or is it just more or less a meet and greet with no advanced planning of any great consequence? Well right now there's no meeting planned, but as you say they will both be in Bali, Indonesia for the G20 in November and it would afford an opportunity for the two of them to sit down in person, actually despite the fact that they've spent a huge amount of time together when Joe Biden was Vice President, they've not met in person since President Biden became President, and that's because Xi Jinping is basically not left China in two years due to COVID-19. So this would be their first real chance to sit face to face and talk through the full range of issues in the relationship. I wouldn't expect major agreements to come out of that, but if they do actually sit, and again that hasn't been decided, I would expect that we would see some progress on some issues where the two countries' interests do align. As we talk today it's becoming out that President Putin will be meeting with President Xi Jinping most likely somewhere in Europe, not too long from now, was that a surprise to you, and what do you think they're going to be talking about? Well it's not a surprise, President Xi and President Putin have met frequently over the course of each of their tenure, and in fact President Putin went to Beijing earlier this year and met in person with President Xi in February when they rolled out this new partnership between the two countries. So I think that they'll talk about the full range of issues in their relationship, but I would note two things. First, before President Xi goes to Uzbekistan to meet with Putin on the sidelines of another summit, he's going to Kazakhstan. And Kazakhstan's a place where actually China and Russia compete for influence. So it's an indication that this is a relationship not without its complications. And then second, China has actually stood back from fully getting in behind the Russians when it comes to their war in Ukraine. We have not seen them provide large scale support in terms of weapons or industrial scale efforts to undermine Western sanctions. So from our perspective, this relationship is something that bears close watching, but again, is not without its complications. As we talk, there's also reports that North Korea is selling weapons to Russia. Was that a surprise to the administration? Well, what it indicates actually is that Russia doesn't have a lot of options. It appears to be running short of its own munitions. It looks around the world and doesn't find a lot of countries willing to sell it munitions. So it has to look to states like Iran and North Korea to get ammunition and other forms of weaponry to be able to sustain its conflict in Ukraine. This is not, in our view, a demonstration of strength by Russia. Now, the negotiation with Iran to restore, if that's the right verb, the nuclear agreement is ongoing. It's been going going for quite some time. Do you see any resolution of that in the near future? Not in the coming days. The Iranians have come back with a set of counter proposals, which we are still taking a look at, but it doesn't suggest that an agreement is imminent right away. That being said, we do believe that there still is a pathway to a compliance for compliance return to the JCPOA. We will continue to work on that with our partners, particularly our European partners. And if Iran is prepared to do its part to get back into the JCPOA, we stand ready to do so. And as we talk, the new Prime Minister of UK has been announced, previously involved in foreign policy. Have you met her before? I have met her before. I've met her here in the White House right down the hall from where we are right now when she was foreign secretary. She's transitioned from being essentially their secretary of state to being their prime minister. And actually, just yesterday, President Biden had the opportunity to have a long phone call with her just hours after she had assumed her new position. And do you expect any change in the UK U.S. policy as a result of her becoming prime minister? At a foundational level, no. This is a special relationship. The two of them reaffirmed their commitment to the strength and vitality of the U.S. UK alliance. And I think on all of the major issues, whether it's Russia, or China, or Iran, you'll see.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1276,2022-11-20 19:07:52
18663," commitment to the strength and vitality of the USUK alliance. And I think on all of the major issues, whether it's Russia or China or Iran, you'll see the same kind of deep consultation and engagement between the two countries that you've seen before, regardless of who's president, regardless of who's prime minister. So I don't expect that there will be any fundamental changes in the relationship, but there'll be issues that we have to work through, of course, as there always are. Now, as we talk, the UN General Assembly will be meeting not too long from now in New York, as it does every year. Do you think the UN has still a useful purpose in diplomacy, because it doesn't seem to be able to solve any problems, ongoing war problems that we now see in the US, are Ukraine or Russia? What do you think is the UN's main purpose at this point? Well, the UN actually has proved its continued effectiveness in actually being able to bring about diplomatic agreements in very difficult circumstances. I'll give you just two examples from the past few months. First, on Russia, Ukraine, it was the UN Secretary General, Antonio Gutierrez, who played a central role in getting a deal between Russia and Ukraine for the export of grain from both Ukrainian ports and Russian ports in the Black Sea. That's helping the entire world with respect to lowering food prices and expanding access to food stuffs at a critical moment. Second, it was a UN mediator working with our US envoy, the Saudis, Emirates, and the Yemenis, who helped produce earlier this year a ceasefire in the war in Yemen, which had been the worst humanitarian catastrophe in the world. That ceasefire is now going on six months, the longest period of peace in seven years in Yemen, and the UN played a key role in that. So it is not without its difficulties and complications, it is a big bureaucracy in need of constant reform, but the UN is still there on key issues in diplomacy, in delivering on global health, global food security, and other issues, and all of that will be on display in New York in two weeks. Now, recently, the President made a major speech on democracy. While the threat to American democracy is real, I want to say as clearly as we can, we are not powerless in the face of these threats. And in it, he talked about the values of democracy, which is large part of our foreign policy, which is to promote democracy around the world. Our events in the United States are the last year or so, making it more difficult for the US to say to other countries, look at how wonderful our democracy has worked, and therefore you should be following some of the things we do. Well, it does require a degree of humility. I mean, the United States does need to acknowledge that we have our own difficulties and challenges within our own democracy, even as we tout and promote democratic institutions, rule of law, human rights around the world. But I think President Biden is actually a very good messenger for that. Someone who can speak honestly and clearly to the American people about the strains in our democracy, and then someone who can speak honestly and clearly to the world about how despite all of its imperfections, democracy remains the best form of government for delivering, for citizens, and for promoting human dignity. Imagine simply climbing a cable into space. The concept is known as the space elevator. Not only could it significantly change how we leave planet Earth, but it could also completely transform humanity's relationship with space. And there are scientists who think we could have already built it. We have the material. We have the technology. We have the lasers. We have the climbers. We have all of them. If a private entity wants to build it, or a government, they can build it. It'll change society. We have no clue how colonizing in the space, how really spreading on the space, really changed our society over the next 50 to 200 years.

18664," This is a talk a moment about your own background. You are not generally out there promoting your background. You grew up in Minnesota. I guess you were a superstar in elementary school, junior high school, your president of your class, president of student government. Is there anything you failed to do in high school that you wanted to do? Well, I didn't win all the cross country races that I wanted to win, I guess. But you went to Yale. You must have done reasonably well, you were elected as a Rhodes Scholar and from Oxford you later came back and went to Yale Law School and you were a top-editor there and became a Supreme Court clerk for Justice Breyer. So when you're having this career, do you ever think that you could make a mistake or your career could kind of go off the deep end or something because everything was working out perfectly? Well, it's true that I have had these incredible opportunities. But at every one of those stages, I went through the same fears and growing pains and slip ups and stumbles that everybody did. And that was true with respect to academic work that was far from perfect. It was true with respect to relationships that didn't work out. I had what I think was an incredibly lucky childhood in upbringing. But one that was not too different from the way a lot of other people who grew up in the Midwest in the 1980s and then got to have these chances. Their father and mother, what could they do? So my father worked on the business side of Minneapolis Star Tribune, which was the major newspaper in Minneapolis. My mother was a teacher and a guidance counselor in the Minneapolis Public Schools and I'm one of five. I'm the second of five kids and we all went to the Minneapolis Public Schools, graduated from Southwest High School. Your siblings, do they say, look, you're too good, you're a road scholar, you're a yellow all journal and everything, are there no sibling rivalries? I mean, actually, I would say my sister is probably the most impressive among us. She's a pediatrician. She was a two sport division one athlete and she's got five kids and is currently working at the Department of Health and Human Services on COVID-19 and other pandemic responses. So I'm like kind of middle of the pack in terms of my siblings. There was another person who was a road scholar went to Yale, all school, who became President of the United States, Bill Clinton. So have you ever thought of running for office yourself? I used to think about it, but honestly, over the course of the years, I think my skills are better suited to public service and not elected format and I'd rather help other people who I think would be better suited for actually running for office themselves. Up for a moment about what it's like to be the national security advisor. National Security Advisor office was set up, I think, in the Eisenhower administration more or less. So President Truman had a national security advisor as well. Your job is to get in early every day, make sure there's no crisis or there is a crisis to tell the President. Are you seeing the President early in the morning and briefing him? Is that what you do as many have done before? Yes. So in the morning, we have something called the President's Daily Brief. That takes place in the Oval Office. And it's myself, my two deputies, and then the director of national intelligence who are there every day. And then we also bring in other cabinet members depending on what the subjects are being briefed so that he gets, the President gets exposure to his full national security team over the course of the week. And we talked to him about things that have developed overnight around the world. And we also talked to him about longer term trends that he expresses interest in and wants to stay on top of. So it's a mix of both the immediate term and the long term. And it gives him a full picture of the challenges and opportunities in the world for American folks. And then during a typical day, do you see him a couple other times? Do you see him at the end of the day as well? Well, just to take yesterday as an example, in addition to the PDB Secretary Blinken and I had the opportunity to just sit with him informally for a little while before the changes areント gt.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1278,2022-11-20 19:16:38
18665," as an example, in addition to the PDB, Secretary Blinken and I had the opportunity to just sit with him informally for a little while before the cabinet meeting. So we could talk through a kind of tick list of issues that had been building up over the course the last couple of weeks. And then later in the afternoon, we had this call with the British Prime Minister. And that involved some amount of time to talk through what he wanted to accomplish in that phone call, what we expected. She would say to him. And then I sat there with him while he did the phone call. So that would be a typical day, seeing the president two, three times. And then spending time with the other principles of the National Security Council, the cabinet secretary, Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of State, and talking through the big decisions that we would need to tee up for the president to make on everything from global food security to Taiwan, to the CHIPS Act, the new law that's been passed to invest in advanced microchips here in the United States. We covered the waterfront. So sometimes presidents, I observe, lose their temper and they yell. His president Biden, I yell, everyone he's not happy or he just calmly just says, here's what I think. He's not a yell. He's somebody who is disciplined and direct and holds us to a high standard. And he will challenge us to make sure that we have nailed down the details of everything we are presenting to him. And if we haven't, he'll tell us, do better. But he does so in a totally respectful, straightforward way, the same way that everybody has seen him in public life. So when I work in the White House under President Carter, there were frequent disputes between the Secretary of State, Sy Vance, and the National Security Advisor as a big brazen ski. And it's a great tradition, it seems, in our government, that the Secretary of State, the National Security Advisor, always sparring one where they are leaking to the press. In this administration, I haven't seen a lot of leaks from your office or the Secretary's office criticizing the other person's office. So how have you avoided that problem? Well, a lot of it has to do with just deep mutual respect and straight up friendship between myself and the Secretary of State, Tony and I have known each other for years. We're good friends, our families are friends. That doesn't mean that there aren't debates. We don't have disputes because we have an open operating style, I think we both try to be nice people. But we do have debates. We disagree on certain issues. And the thing that I take very seriously is my responsibility to run a process that is open, humane, fair, transparent, and above board. And I try to do that so that his perspective, the Secretary of Defense's perspective, the Attorney General's perspective, depending on the issue, are all teed up to the president in a way in which they get their say. And then we work it out. And that has, in my view, worked quite effectively over the course of the past 19 months. And I consider it one of the central responsibilities of my position to ensure that that process is fair and effective. In hindsight, which is always 2020, is there anything the administration could have done to prevent Putin from invading? Six months into this invasion, I'm fairly well convinced that Putin was going to do this no matter what. What do you think of when you think of a battery? For most, it's what we use to power devices for both work and play, and maybe even your car. Over the past few decades, they've gotten way more powerful, long-lasting, and affordable. But all of this is just a prologue to what the next batteries are going to do. As we drive to an increasingly renewable power-driven grid, we also need to be able to store energy and release it later to cover those periods of weather intermittencies that are driving this new grid that we're in. It's a multi-trillion dollar opportunity, and it's imperative that we figure out the solution here. How we store energy on a massive scale is, in many ways, the central challenge of the fight to stop climate change.

Let's go around the world for a couple of trouble spots. North Korea, any progress on getting them to give up their nuclear testing? Or is that difficult to do? It's difficult, obviously, through multiple presidents going back to the Clinton administration. The North Koreans have continued to move forward with their nuclear weapons program. In the course of the past year, they have conducted a number of long-range missile tests. We have been warning about the possibility of a seventh nuclear test to a nuclear weapon. We still think that that is something that is likely to happen in the coming months. We have also indicated to the North Koreans that we are prepared to sit down in a serious way to conduct diplomacy, to, on a step-by-step basis, work towards the de-nuclearization of the Korean peninsula. So far, the North Koreans have been so interested in that. China and Taiwan. There has been a lot of rhetoric from the U.S. side and a lot of rhetoric from the Chinese side. And vision, any real problem occurring where the Chinese might actually invade Taiwan? I think it remains a distinct threat that there could be a military contingency around Taiwan. And the People's Republic of China has actually stated as official policy that it is not taking the invasion of Taiwan off the table. But that remains one of the potential options for the reunification of Taiwan. Their position has been changing over time. In terms of their disturbance of the status quo across the Taiwan Strait, actions that they are taking with their military to undermine peace and stability, the American position has remained steadfast and consistent. One China policy, Taiwan Relations Act, three joint communicates that we agreed with China back in the 1970s and 80s that laid out that from our perspective, there should be no unilateral changes to the status quo across the Taiwan Strait. We continue to believe that and we will continue to push back against any effort to change the status quo by force. Now, there is legislation now moving through Congress to kind of toughen up the existing support the U.S. has for Taiwan. Is administration adopted a position on that legislation yet? Well, I'm actually going to have the opportunity later today. Later today to go up to the hill to talk to some members about this legislation. I prefer to have the opportunity to lay it out for them before I lay it out on TV. But I will just say this, there are elements of that legislation with respect to how we can strengthen our security assistance for Taiwan that are quite effective and robust that will improve Taiwan's security. There are other elements that give us some concern. Let's go back to Ukraine for a moment. In hindsight, which is always 2020, is there anything the administration could have done to prevent Putin from invading or told the allies more forcefully that this invasion was going to occur to convince them because it seemed as if they didn't really believe it was going to happen? What would you have done or would you think you should have done in hindsight if anything, differently than you did? Given that we're still in the middle of this unfolding crisis, it's hard to get the kind of level of perspective to look back and say, hey, maybe we could have done this instead of that. There's always something you could have improved upon. I would never say no, no, no, no, we did everything absolutely perfectly. But six months into this invasion, I'm fairly well convinced that Putin was going to do this no matter what, that he considered this central to his legacy as President of Russia, and he was not going to be knocked off course. The only thing that was going to stop him was the physical might of the U.S.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1280,2022-11-20 19:25:12
18667," that he considered this central to his legacy as President of Russia, and he was not going to be knocked off course. The only thing that was going to stop him was the physical might of the Ukrainian forces holding back his ability to take Kiev and take other major cities, backed by the weapons that we provided them. That was the strategy we executed. I think we executed it well, and I think Ukraine is in a position now today to ensure that they will remain a strong, sovereign, viable, independent state, even as they continue to try to resist Russian aggression on a portion of their territory. In terms of the Allies, we took unprecedented measures, quite novel measures, to declassify information, to make presentations both to our allies and to the international community. I think over time that actually did build a sense of unity that continues to this day. An Allied unity, Transatlantic unity, has been a huge thorn in the side for Vladimir Putin as he's tried to break that and try to produce a weaker, less cohesipnato when in fact what he's gotten is the exact opposite. So what you're referring to, I think, is that to my surprise when I was reading The New York Times about this was going on, information that seemed like it was vital information was declassified and, in effect, given to the press about the troop movements of the Russians. Was that a complicated decision to come to? Controversial within the administration to say we're going to declassify and leak our best intelligence about what the Russians are doing? It definitely took a whole process of us thinking about all of the risks and benefits of doing that, especially since it was uncharted territory. And that involved me sitting with our intelligence professionals, our diplomats, and ultimately with the president, to bless a strategy that would involve the systematic declassification of information so that no one would be surprised and so that Russia could not try to generate pretext for what it was doing. And I think it turned out to be an effective method of putting Russia on the back foot, putting the Western alliance on the front foot, and giving us the opportunity to build the coalition that is currently supporting Ukraine. So as I said earlier, hindsight is always 2020. In hindsight, would you have exited Afghanistan differently than the way you did it? Well, at the end of the day, any time you have a circumstance where you're ending a 20-year war with 20 years of decisions and mistakes that have piled up through multiple administrations, the exit would not be easy. There was no clean, easy exit. And I think the strategic decision to go to end that war after 20 years was absolutely the correct decision, where there are things that we could have done differently. I think the answer to that is always yes. And there will be time as I end up looking back and reflecting on that period to pinpoint what some of those might have been. But from my perspective, the underlying decision to end the war in Afghanistan, which the president took, I think, in a quite courageous way, was the correct decision. And one year later, to me, the time that has passed has only reinforced the correctness of that decision. Many people have held your job, have a burnout after a few years. You look like you're in good shape and you're young. You're the second youngest person ever to have this job. So you anticipate doing this for an entire four-year period of this first term. If it's another term, let's say this four-year period of time. Well, I serve at the pleasure of the president, but I feel passionate about the work that I'm doing. I feel blessed to be part of this team. I feel blessed to be able to serve President Biden. I then would like to keep doing it. What are the moon shots at Amazon that are capturing most of your time and attention? Well, you know, we have a unique way that we go get big new investments. And I'm not sure it's right or wrong. It just happens to be our way. And we ask ourselves when we're considering something for questions. We ask if it's successful, can it be big and move the needle in Amazon? Is it being well served today? Do we have a differentiated approach? And do we have confidence there if not, can we acquire quickly?

18668," So it was a single-threaded team that isn't distracted by the rest of the business. When it comes to the stock, it has fallen significantly. Do you think investors are missing something or has tech just been overvalued? I have never tried to predict what stocks might do. In any time I've tried to a little bit, I've been wrong. I do really believe that in the short term, the stock market tends to be a voting machine and the long-term it tends to be a weighing machine. We have a concept we talk about a lot of Amazon inputs and outputs. In the ultimate output for a company is share price. Then other big outputs are free cash flow or profit or revenue. You can't really manage the outputs. You have to manage at the input level and that's where we spend all our time. If you do the right things for the business long term, things tend to work out. I think we've had very good returns for investors and I expect that to be true again. It's normal. It's normal. At a time when everybody else is facing a very different way out.

When Jack Hartung joined Chipotle 20 years ago, it was far from the powerhouse it is today. Chipotle was a special brand. It was an unknown brand. It was very small. Founded in 1993 by Chef Turnodrapreneur Steve L. The company stood on the brink of the growth spurt that would create a category, fast casual dining. It was a really simple idea. Steve had. It was, look, why is fast food crappy? Why can't great food be done fast? I was there when there was a couple dozen restaurants and I would visit restaurants like this where Steve would go behind the line and he'd see somebody cutting an onion and saying, well hold on, let me show you how to do it. Two decades later, Jack Hartung is still the chief financial officer of Chipotle. He's had a hand in just about every area of the operation. I feel like I've always been able to dabble in things outside of just financials. And while his central task is to create greater value for a chain that now has about 3,000 restaurants, he insists on staying true to the values that have defined Chipotle from day one. I think I'm really open-minded, but I really do want to protect the heritage of Chipotle and make sure that we don't lose the essence. It's a powerful blend, a consistent mission that sustains the brand with a commitment to innovation that drives the business. Chipotle's future depends on investments that address both priorities. Jack Hartung embraces that challenge. He's always had a passion for what we do next at our company because he's always been really a champion of growth. I've got to make sure that the financials, the balance sheet, the way we source through the way that we provide through the way that our business works needs to be strong so that we reach our full potential. I love working with people that can figure out how to thread the needle between the numbers and the purpose. Frankly, not everybody can do it, but luckily Jack does it really well and we're pretty fortunate to have him at our company.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1282,2022-11-20 19:33:51
18669," To Paul Lee's growth in the last five years has been nothing short of spectacular. Revenues have jumped nearly 70 percent. The company's market capitalization has more than quadrupled. All this, despite a global pandemic, that's disrupted the restaurant industry. And all this following a food safety crisis that caused sales at the company to crater and forced to shake up in the sea suite. Individually, the team was phenomenal. Individually people were very talented. But it's almost like they didn't have the right people in the right places to handle how big the brand and the platform became. The enhanced food safety procedures, enhanced standards and training. They really enhanced the management team to the marketing dollars, transition them to more effective marketing, brand building efforts with a big focus on reminding consumers of why they love Chipotle. The breakdown was the human capital. The breakdown was in culture. And that's what they've repaired. And that's why they're coming back stronger. What have you learned in your CFO position going through those crises? Which one was the most challenging? The food safety issue was the most challenging because we were alone in that one. That was unique to Chipotle. The pandemic is certainly a challenge, but everyone's in it together. The things that really got us through it is we stay true to our purpose. So during each of these challenges, we made sure we invested in the things that made Chipotle special, invest in higher quality food, invest in our people, and then invest in our growth and invest in things like technology. We have the same around here. I think it actually comes from West Point. We will choose the harder right over the easy rock. How do you and Jack work on things like that? Those black swan events, those things that can be fundamentally changing for you as a company. When we are successful in focusing on the really important things that can strategically drive growth for us, they seem to be having resiliency in these unexpected events. The other thing I think is to make sure you have a strong balance sheet, to make sure you can weather the storm. We have had a strong balance sheet, we have never had debt. We have always had more cash in the balance sheet than we need for our normal ongoing business. And that has come in great, really handy. Chipotle carries no long-term debt, and it's free cash flow almost tripled in 2021. When you think about the future, how do you take advantage of this and what is the flexibility that that enables? What it really affords us is we are going to be able to invest in our future no matter what. Like we accelerated our open. We accelerated our pursuit of new restaurants sites during the pandemic when some of their restaurant companies were laying off their development team. Chipotle not only expanded its footprint over the last two years, it reshaped its restaurants, a venture to drive through dining that began several years ago became a thriving profit center when the pandemic struck. The thing that's changed the most is just most of our restaurants now have a Chipotle. So three years ago, we had maybe five or six Chipotle's. And now we have over 350 and 80% of our new openings have a Chipotle. The sales and our Chipotle restaurants are higher and our margins are higher too because the digital orders are our highest margin transaction. And when you can serve the customer through the Chipotle without the delivery fees that we pay and the customers pay, it's a great margin opportunity for us. The convenience of Chipotle is contributed to soaring digital sales in 2020. There was little erosion in 2021, even as in restaurant sales returned to 80% of 2019 levels. Meanwhile, membership and loyalty programs has boomed, giving Chipotle valuable insight into its customer's omnichannel preferences. What we've seen is that our digital customers, they come the most often and they spend the most each time they come. Customer loyalty could face a test if inflation continues to push higher. Chipotle hiked menu prices roughly 9% in 2021. Jack Hartung says it's not just wages and food costs that are putting on the pressure. It's hitting everything. Getting materials too for a restaurant or a new restaurant's are costing more as well.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1283,2022-11-20 19:38:09
18670," It's hitting everything. Titting materials too for a restaurant. So a new restaurant's are costing more as well. You guys have had incredible pricing power. Is there kind of a tipping point where it's like enough? We haven't seen it. Why is that Jack? Well, part of it is we've over the years been slow to raise prices. We've always tried not to go to the menu board to raise prices, whenever we've had a challenge from a cost standpoint. We'll do other things to try to find efficiencies somewhere along the line. We raised prices in the second quarter of last year. We did that just to cover the cost of raising wages. We raised wages up to $15, who was an average of 15% increase. And we raised prices just to cover the dollar cost of that. So we didn't increase our margins. Our margins actually went down. But our profitability stayed the same. Our customers actually said, we really applaud what you're doing. We're fine with a 4% price increase. Not a chicken burrito, that's 30 cents. But the fact that you increase wages to that extent, we'd like you to eat a more spoiled. CEO Brian Nichol has warned that Chipotle may raise prices again if cost pressures intensify. With the cost of eating out already at historic levels, consumers may just have to get used to paying more. The industry is used to type an inflation. Call it 2%, level inflation. They take a little bit of priced offset, if flows through and margins are just naturally restored. The fact of the matter is labor was the pressure point. So the industry today is definitely sitting on a high single-digit price versus what is typically a low single-digit price inflation or level of menu price increase. In relative terms, everyone has to do this. In fact, I would say, Carl, we could be more patient than others because we own all of our restaurants. When you're a franchise organization, when you have franchisees that have borrowed to invest in their business, they can't necessarily afford to let inflation eat away at their ability to pay the debt for very long. It is full speed ahead when it comes to store growth. Chipotle just upped its goal to 7,000 from 6,000 restaurants in the US. Thanks in large part to strong performance at seeing its smaller towns. Based on, we're already in more than 100 of them. Based on the ones we're in, based on the results so far, which are extraordinary, we think there is as many as almost 1,000 more restaurants. So even though you're talking about a small town with maybe 20,000, 30,000 people, the sales volumes are almost the same as if you're in a city like Chicago or a Chicago suburb, but the investment costs are lower, the rents are certainly lower, and the operating costs are lower. So you end up getting higher margins and higher returns. Chipotle reaps the full benefit of these returns since it owns and operates all its stores, and advantage that's not lost on Wall Street. It's extremely unusual and not only restaurants, but from a restaurant stock perspective, to have a large cap stock that's growing its unit level economic model, meaning the revenues are getting better, and the margins are getting better, as growth is accelerating. It's just, it's like almost unheard of. So there's little reason for Chipotle to begin franchising in the United States. But for the chain's 45 international restaurants, Bloomberg intelligence notes that partnering with local operators overseas might boost margins and accelerate expansion. We're open to the idea of some kind of franchise model. You know, there are areas of the world where it's going to be harder for us to own and to run the businesses ourselves when they're processed of bringing our digital system to Europe that's going really, really well. We've also opened up some alternative sites. It gives us great optimism that international is going to be a growth, be a core core and hopefully not to this future.

Like Chipotle's menu, Jack Hartung's professional resume isn't patted out with exotic ingredients. After earning a bachelor's degree in MBA at Illinois State, he went straight to an accounting job at Cooper's in Lyberton. His next stop, 18 years at McDonald's. They called me up and McDonald's was just a few miles down the road and just said this place is great. And what they told me was great about it was you started in one area, but then when a job opens up, they would post it and you can interview for it. So I felt, well, that's not great. So I can learn a job and then if I'm looking for another opportunity, I can interview for it. And if I've done a good job, I'll get those opportunities. Which is what happened? I am curious when you went from McDonald's to Chipotle, where folks like, Jack, here you've got this established company you're going to start it. I mean, did people think you were crazy? Yeah, I mean, a lot of people thought I was crazy. In fact, one memorable person was a CEO of McDonald's at the time because I had a great career at McDonald's and the future looked really, really good. At Chipotle, it was in its infancy and it had this vision for food. That was like no other than I've seen. How much of it was? McDonald's own 90% of Chipotle. How much of it was? All right, Jack, keep an eye on these guys. You know, that's how it started. Okay. And it wasn't keep an eye on it, but it was more, their food culture was very advanced. Their business culture was not. And so it was more of bringing some of your experience to Chipotle just so you can get them on a stronger track. Once I got into Chipotle environment and I realized, oh my God, I want to be part of this. There was a passion about what we were doing. So it wasn't a finance job anymore. It was a job that was really changing food culture in this country. And it was a mission. And it was a mission that I totally bought into. Chipotle's culture and mission have long differentiated it as a place to eat. With restaurants competing fiercely for employees in the wake of the pandemic, companies are going to have to show that they are great places to work as well. It's not just about that person coming back to work in the restaurant. They're going to come back, but they're not going to come back and work the way they did before. I think that the companies that win are those that are investing in their employees, their teams that are developing a strong culture that people want to be a part of. The real win on a micro level is if restaurants can figure out how to make that employee work better and more efficiently, but in a way that makes them more satisfied. At this new location just outside Chicago, Jack Hartung told me what it will take to build a workforce to meet Chipotle's goals. You've got to start with attractive wages, but then you've got to go away via that. You've got to offer developmental opportunities, promotional opportunities. We have 100,000 employees, and as we grow from 3,000 restaurants to 7,000 restaurants, we're going to need 200 or 250,000 employees. So our future depends on hiring great crew today. That will be great managers in the future. Double the locations, double the staff, and along with investing in people, Chipotle plans to invest in technology to support them.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1285,2022-11-20 19:47:05
18672," Double the locations, double the staff, and along with investing in people, Chipotle plans to invest in technology to support them. There is so much still that can be done with artificial intelligence, robotics. When you think about our system, there are a lot of processes that frankly people don't love doing. Cutting and courting avocados in the restaurant. Not a fun job. Very repetitive. I think there's a way where we could use robotics to help us do that. And then as you think about artificial intelligence, we could be better at figuring out how many avocados we have to cut and courted it. So that we never run out of walkable we throw out today. As digital orders have surged, Chipotle has adapted its processes. The most dramatic change has been the addition of a second make line. This is very familiar to customers, our front line. And this is what for the first, you know, call it 18 years at Chipotle. This was you come in at Chipotle along the line, you interact with the crew and you customize your meal. We've got this separate make line and it's digitized. And so the orders come in and they're really kind of staged so that if you say at noon, I want to commit at 1 o'clock, we hold that order and we will send it to the crew like a maybe 10 to 1. So it's ready right when you pull up your car. How do you manage these kind of two different staffing needs, right? Making sure you have the right amount of people at the right time. We spend a lot of time projecting sales of a lot of it is, you know, it's part art, part science. We're trying to bring more science and more AI into it because if you get the right sales projection, then you know exactly what your what your staffing needs to be. So if you get the sales right, you can get the entire restaurant staff perfectly with just a couple of people. Our average restaurant now does about over a million dollars per restaurant in digital sales. Data science meets culinary art and Chipotle's commitment to menu innovation. But releasing several new items each year, management hopes to boost same store sales. It seems to be working, but it's more complicated than it looks. The most important thing is to make sure that the economics work, meaning when you bring something new, does it bring in additional customers? Does it bring existing customers more often? There's always going to be trade off from one menu item to another and there could be economic either advantages or disadvantages. So we just want to understand that, you know, when a customer comes in, if they're trading from a high margin item to low margin item, that's going to be a loser and worse. And any new offering must meet Chipotle's rigorous sourcing standards. It will take us a year and a half from the time that we are experimenting in the test kitchen to we'll put it into a few restaurants to see how does it work operationally. It will do customers like it, but it will take us a year and a half because we've then got to build up a supply chain. It's a challenge, but we take our time and we're not going to roll it out before it's ready. Jack Carton clearly places a high value on the customer experience and the experience of those who work at Chipotle restaurants. He's a people person and a family man with five children and ten grandchildren. Even his favorite hobby brings family into play. It's a passion for collecting and restoring classic cars. I drive here very conservatively, so I'm not like ripping down the highway or anything, but these are cars that I really cared about and really admired and aspired to when I was young. And so I still love these cars. There's a bonding that goes on as well. One of my sons is a mechanic. So he's a mechanic for Tesla. And he loves cars. And so we send time to car shows together. We'll go to auctions and look for cars. And so we have a great time. And he knows how to fix the cars. And I know how to drive the cars. And so that's kind of the partnership that we have. But we have a great time together. Up next, sustainability is much more than a buzzword for Chipotle. And it's more than figures on a spreadsheet for Jack Carton. Jack is 100% bought into our purpose of cultivating a better world. And he tells me what a chief future officer has to learn not to do. Every CFO knows how to read financial statements and go through what a CFO is supposed to do. But I think what you have to do is put those aside at some point. This is Bloomberg. And so now they're getting hundreds, maybe even thousands of applications.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1286,2022-11-20 19:51:15
18673," The Companies now they're getting hundreds maybe even thousands of applications. So software has come in to Automate the process. You want to write your resume for robots not for humans. The only job your resume has Is to be comprehensible to the software that is reading it because that software or robot is going to decide whether or not a human ever gets their eyes on it These things are programmed by a certain segment of the population that might not be totally inclusive or not be Totally aware concerns about how this technology could exacerbate discrimination For the FTC. I think foremost the FTC needs to be making sure that we're fully understanding this technology We don't trust companies to self-regulate when it comes to pollution We don't trust them to self-regulate when it comes to workplace comp Why on earth would we trust them to self-regulate AI? Essential pillar of Chipotle's business has always been a commitment to fresh food and support of sustainable agriculture From responsibly raised meat to local and organic produce the companies crafted a supply chain carefully over decades Every company is facing supply chain challenges Chipotle has a great infrastructure. They have a sophisticated team They have relationships with their suppliers a lot of whom are local and a lot who have gotten to know jack heartung He's done much more to build those relationships than just sign checks Within my first year, I was spending time on hog farms cilantro farms. Believe it or not. I was I drove a combine you know, that's like the size of this restaurant to harvest rice Organic rice and these are things that they had they had a lasting impression on me because When I would go back to my office and I would be working on spreadsheets of financial analysis I saw how the hogs were raised and I saw how they were raised conventionally versus with our farmers And I'm like I've got to make sure that our financials and all all everything we spend money on needs to be thoughtful so that we can Invest in the better way raising food is more expensive food by this food I was trying to make sure that the economic model supported investing in this food and not through higher-menu prices Jack is 100% bought into our purpose of cultivating a better world one of those key planks This sustainability and doing the right thing for the planet and as a result He's all important with investing and understanding the implications on the business and then obviously our purpose We know what matters we know what matters not just to our customers to our crew as well We do the right things we do what's right for our people we do it's right for the farmers right we do it's right for the environment For the last 20 years at Chipotle Jack Hartung has made strategic decisions based on what matters even in times of turmoil and crisis Looking back more often than not it's paid off So I wanted to know what he sees when he looks ahead What's the opportunity for Chipotle in the next 10 years it excites you the most Well, I think the most exciting thing is that we're not even halfway to our potential Um in the US So you know when I joined a company with a few hundred restaurants and we were talking about a thousand maybe two thousand Here we are three thousand talking about seven I believe as we approach seven that number is going to be higher a lot higher Well, I don't know how much higher, but for sure it's going to go up and international we're just scratching the surface And we've been very responsible in the international where we've taken that same food ethos We've owned the restaurant so far and so it's been a very slow. Let's make sure we get this right You know sometimes you have to go slow before you go fast That's kind of then our approach We've gone slow and now we're positioning ourselves to I think in the not-feet-dis-in-future go fast in international So those are two things that excite me the most all right What's the challenge for the next 10 years that Is on your mind the most that maybe and keeps you up at night people When we run all of our restaurants like we do today We have around a hundred thousand employees as we grow. We're going to need more employees We promoted 19,000 people last year 90% of our of our promotions were in-house So we always have to be on our game in terms of higher and great people that believe in Chipotle and our purpose today That have the desire to learn how to cook learn how to run a business learn how to lead people if we do a great job with that the future only gets brighter",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1287,2022-11-20 19:55:32
18674," We leave in Chipotle and our purpose today that have the desire to learn how to cook, learn how to run a business, learn how to lead people. If we do a great job with that, the future only gets brighter. So we're in great shape from the people's standpoint, but that's something that I'll always worry about. Are we hiring and developing the right people? You don't want to be losing people. If we lose people, then we might have to resort to franchising. And it's hard to follow a purpose during tough times, like during a pandemic. It's hard to invest in things like food and people. You win margin for under pressure. When you own your own restaurants, you can make those investments. How do you see your role as CFO changing in the next 10 years? Safe to say, it's changed a lot in the past 10 years. How about the next 10? It has. I think it'll just evolve with the challenges. I mean, again, I'm already fortunate that I've been able to get involved in real estate and supply chain. I spend time in a restaurant, spend time in suppliers, spend time in international as well. So I always get to spend a lot of time in a lot of these areas. I think in terms of evolution, it's probably more a matter of the folks on my team, some of which are new that you've been following in the last few years, some of which have been with us for a long time, to help them rise up so they can take on bigger responsibilities. And we become a bigger company. Everybody in the company will need to step up and take on bigger responsibility. So my main goal will be to make sure that they're ready to take those on. What's the skill set that you think every CFO should be acquiring in this environment? I think being a digital savvy is probably the most important thing. Trying to stay, you know, keep up or even stay ahead of where technology is going, not just in the next five years, the next 10 or 15 years, I think that's the most critical for CFO. What's the best advice for the future that you give to somebody a person who just got promoted to CFO today? I would say be really, really curious. Try to learn as much as you can about every part of the business. Every CFO knows how to read financial statements and go through what a CFO is supposed to do. But I think what you have to do is put those aside at some point. Go spend time in your business. In our case, spend time in restaurants, spend time with suppliers. I think get to know how other people within the business, what their challenges are, what their opportunities are, what really makes the customer care about your brand or your business. And I think the more you do that, when you go back to the spreadsheets, you're going to be thinking about things from a different standpoint. Your priorities might change a little bit. And it might change how you make investments to make sure that the customer experience is better next time, rather than the margin is better. I mean, if you invest in the customer in a way where they become loyal to your customer, the margin will come. Hartfeld and hands on. Jack Hartung is put Chipotle in position to go forward by always making sure the business goes back to the start and stays true to its roots. So it makes him Chipotle's chief teacher officer.

Thank you so much for joining us. Thank you for having me. What drives you? What drives me? Oh my God. I love the idea of just a simple as this uninclusive world. A world where people see themselves reflected. Because I was supposed to be invisible by your accounts. I was supposed to not be where I am. I was supposed to have disappeared a long time ago. And every turn in my life was about visibility. Yes, I will be this person who's not supposed to be here. Yes, I will fight through the hard times. Yes, I won't give up. And even though I was sort of the token black editor in the industry in the 90s, I knew even then that I needed to bring people up with me. I needed to bring other people up with me. And so that's really been a part of, you know, maybe it's maybe it was growing up in a family of six. I don't know. When you run a team, how do you instill that work ethic that kind of answering emails at all time? I mean, you know, I think you see an example, you know, if you're an editor who leads and has lunches and it's never in the office, you know, you don't really sort of instill faith. My team know that, you know, we're on a mission. We have to reflect the world we live in. We have to reflect the beauty of multiculturalism. We have to reflect, you know, the beauty and diversity and inclusivity. So everybody takes it really seriously and we really have intense conversations about the side guys and the world. And so, you know, I'm very lucky to have a team who are as passionate. And, you know, I can call my team, you know, I can call somebody at 6 a.m. or they can call me at 6 a.m. and I'll pick up and they'll pick up. So, you know, we have something very special that we've built over the past sort of five years. But there were difficult moments, right? I think the first time one of your first issues, you thought that you could have been fired for it. Is that, right? I mean, I lived in America for a bit and I was working for W Magazine and there was a talk of Brexit. And of course, Americans were like your country's really, you know, xenophobic. So, you know, I came back and I thought...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1289,2022-11-20 20:04:08
18676," And there was talk of Brexit and of course Americans were like your country's really, you know, xenophobic. So, you know, I came back and I thought, you know, I'm going to be welcome with open arms and they're going to love me and oh my god, literally back to them by fire. But I remember thinking, you know, I wanted to create a magazine where every woman could see themselves. You know, wherever a woman regardless of the backgrounds, regardless of their age could just literally see themselves. And at the time, now it looks like it's the norm when you look at other magazines. But in 2017, that was that was a radical idea. But I also remember thinking, you know, with my background, you know, I've lost so much and gained so much that I thought, if I'd lose, if I'm fired, I'd rather be fired for what I believed in. I'd rather be fired for creating a magazine that reflected the world as it was than try to sort of create a second-rate version of someone's vision. And that continues. I mean, there's this idea of always pushing forward. Yeah. Right? What's the end? How do you measure success? How do I measure success? I'm definitely not financial. I mean, I think it's more about, for me, when I'm really exhausted, when I'm really tired, when I'm really questioning, if I can go on, you know, I walk on a street and I see a little girl, a little black girl who's seen the magazine, and it's the norm for them all, a curvy woman on a traitor palace, who's like, thank you for, you know, seeing me, you know, that makes it worth what? That for me is success. And anybody who knows or has known me for a while will witness that that for me is success. You know, my job is done when that happens. Do you think people come up to you? They do, but it's always in a positive way. It's always thank you for seeing us, you know. But I can relate, because, like I said to you, you know, by all accounts, I was meant to be invisible, you know. So for me, shining in light on people and making them seen, it's natural for me. They say that the fashion industry is changing. You're changing it. Are others around you changing it? I mean, now, you know, you look at other magazines and seeing real women in there, it's no longer a radical act. Seeing, you know, people of color, women of color on covers is no longer a radical act. So it's been normalized. And for me, I'm quite happy when I see that. You know, when you put Dame Judy Dengue on the cover, and she's 85 years old, and the world just laughed at it. Nobody questioned her, you know, should she be on the cover or you put, you know, a girl with a hijab on the cover. And it's not a problem. That for me shows that, you know, we're advancing, we're progressing. So, you know, progress for me is very important. Which is important. And so how do you take care of your team? How do you build a team around you? I mean, somebody said to me once, when you build a team, make sure you employ people you like. People, when you see them working towards your office, you're just so excited to see. That was it. Being good at your job and sort of a connection. And being excited to see, you know, team members, because you only have good as your team. You know, no man is an island. You know, I don't create the magazine on my own. And so it's great to have a team who, you respect and who's views you respect, you know, and who respect yours. How do you think you're seen by your team? Do you have to be fearful? Do you have to be, also terrible? I mean, I'm a worker. I work very hard. But I think I'm pretty open. You can have conversations with me. You know, ultimately the final decision rests with me. But I do listen. I like conversation. I like interaction. And so that's, I mean, that's how I hope they think I'm a good boss. And that's, you know, really all you can hope for. Because, you know, they work on a very good magazine. They can get other jobs anywhere. So the fact that they're there makes me think that they must be happy. Edward, how do you see the publishing world changing? So people buy less magazines. You've been, I mean, you've been doing pretty well in terms of selling more. In five years, how does it look? How does it look? I mean, I was like, you know, five years ago, I even, I mean, let's go back to IT.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1290,2022-11-20 20:08:37
18677," I mean, you've been doing pretty well in terms of selling more. But in five years, how does it look? I mean, I was like, five years ago, I... I mean, let's go back to ID when I was 18. You know, I inherited a magazine, you know, which would come out. I was all about club kids and you had to be out there. And the only way you could see street fashion was through ID. And then 2017, I inherited a magazine. But now, I oversee a brand. You know, the magazine is still there. The magazine is sort of the highest, sort of the high, the best paper, you know, the best photographers, the best, you know, cultural messages. But at the moment, you know, when you manage a brand, it's not just about that. It's about digital. It's about video. It's about audio. It's about events. So for somebody who's so forward looking, it's so great for me. And people always ask, oh, it's a magazine instead. When we launch a cover, Instagram, it's our cover, essentially. So I've, you know, found a way, we've found a way of sort of making it work hand in hand. And it's so great for me, you know. I think how do I just been doing the magazine? I probably would have been bored. So magazines aren't dead? Are they gonna go down? No, I mean, you know, yeah, but they're gonna work in hand with digital platforms, you know. But also, I'll tell you something. New readers of folk, young readers, don't necessarily come to us through the new stands. They come through that, you know, do they sell platforms or, you know, audio or videos we put out? So yes, now it's increased 10 folds. So yeah. Well, do you think that will change the kind of readership that you will court, the either age of your readers, but also where they come from? Yes, I mean, at the moment, you know, I think the readership is getting younger because of, you know, the whole digital landscape. And I hope that, you know, as we move forward, it kind of, yeah, we have new readers and we also keep our loyal readers, you know. I don't, do you think there's ever a time where actually we won't have print magazines anymore? No, I think print will always exist sort of a long-side digital, but it'll probably be something more precious, sort of better paper, something more collectible that you want to keep in your house, almost like artwork. So no, I don't think print is going to die. So fewer copies. So you were copied, but more quality. But more quality. You know, almost like a book. The table book. I love that. I know. You need to. I know. Back in 1997, I was interested in the following question, which is there are a bunch of the dinosaurs called Saurapod dinosaurs, which had really long skinny necks. So Apatosaurus is an example. That was at really long skinny tails. So I made a computer model that showed that, in fact, the tail of these Saurapod dinosaurs could actually act like a whip, a bull whip. Now, the way a bull whip makes that cracking noise is because the tip of the whip actually goes about twice the speed of sound. OK. And that crack is a sonic boom. I think the way they got a date was to impress the females by making loud booms. You will put a woman on Mars. You will bring forth global cooling. You will be the first chief crypto officer.

18678," Welcome to Deborah, Australia. We're on the close. Welcome to Bloomberg Crick-Doh. You're recently on TikTok. Yes. Is that fun? Well, not so much fun. I literally have to be held back. But the brilliant thing is, you know, I'm so curious. I mean, I like, you know, I like all the digital platforms. I really like to keep my finger on the pulse. You know, I'm not one of those people that leaves work and just shuts themselves in. I really want to be out there seeing the world as today. It's in all its beauty. So, you know, I'm very curious. I have a very curious mind. And I'm glad. I'm glad, you know, it keeps everything moving and exciting. And so is that for Gen Z? Is that a commercial purpose to get also get closer to that? No, it's just out of curiosity. I've always been like that. I've always sort of wanting to know what's next, you know. I didn't want to be the one that's just being told, oh, you're 50 or whatever, you know. I pay attention to everything. But, you know, the world is such a beautiful place for me, you know, and it goes back to my childhood again. Well, be your biggest challenge to grow the brand in the next five years. Because we still keep it relevant. You know, we have such great digital traffic, you know, almost almost six million every month to British folk. But I'm really sort of excited about overseeing the European votes as well, Spain, Italy, Germany, and France, and sort of mentoring a whole new generation of editors, you know. When there was this whole agonization, the whole world thought there was a global view that was going to dominate. But it's very much about local conversations, as well as global conversations. So I learned from these content leads. And I hope that, you know, they also learn. So the local global conversation, I'm very excited about moving into the future. Do you think it changes if we're in a recessionary environment? So you have such a, you know, glamorous lifestyle, or what you sell is so glamorous. Is it impacted by the cost of living or inflation of what we can live through? I mean, you know, I remember a few years ago, I put Taylor Swift on the cover, and the byline was by better, by less. And it was a radical concept at the time. But now we all talk about sustainability. We know we can't keep shopping every day. We know we have to buy things that last, things that help the planet, things that we can pass on to sort of other generations. So I think that really is the conversation of the fashion industry is having right now that I find so exciting. And it's going to be sort of, you know, people are going to have less money so they have to buy things that last. And I'm really excited. And these are real changes. It's not just real changes. Real changes. It's not just conversation. It's actually happening. Do you think fashion brands always need to have a political point of view when they're great injustices? I think fashion brands can do more. I feel that having a black model in your show, or having, you know, a feed on your Instagram post, it's not enough. We need diverse voices behind the scenes. I always say that I talk to sort of all the CEOs I know we need to employ more people from, you know, from, you know, diverse backgrounds. Because that's the only way you can even reach out to more people, you know. A variety of voices is always better than just one. And I always also say, you know, let's not just have interns, let's have people on all different levels. And that's what I keep talking to people about. Do they listen? Some listen, but I think since, you know, George Floyd was murdered more and more companies sort of made pledges to people of color. And, you know, it's a slow, it's a slow process. Some have taken it seriously, and some are still working their way through it. But, you know, we have to keep on. The problem is that you can make a pledge and then follow through. I know. Right? You know, so you have to really sort of focus and keep asking that question for people to follow through. And so do you feel like you're a guardian of...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1292,2022-11-20 20:17:12
18679," So you have to really sort of focus and keep asking that question for people to follow through. And so do you feel like you're a guardian of, also of that, of making sure that when you get promised something, they'll do it and you'll hold them into account? Yes, I mean, yes, if they promise something, you know, that I ask for, then I will literally wear you down. I'll literally chase you until you keep your promise. That's just who I am. I mean, we actually have one of the diverse, diverse cabinets here in the UK with Liz Truss. Is that important to you? It is so important as somebody who came from another country and was sort of welcomed by the UK. It's very important to have a diverse cabinet. That's how change happens. You know, going back to what we discussed before. That's how you understand people who are on the periphery or who've been avid. It's so important to have a diverse cabinet. But this you think in terms of policies and what they can bring to the table or just also seeing how the TV or diverse cabinet can have an effect on policy. I hope they can have an effect on the parties themselves as well as policy. For me, it's about policy that makes people's lives better. I know you're also very close to Ghana still. I mean, there's a pretty scandalous anti-LGBT will get through. I mean, you know, it's so funny. I was invited back to Ghana a few years ago by the president. It was the year of the of the return. And I remember the last time we were in Ghana, which we were fleeing. And I really supported the changes. I love the changes that we're going through. But yes, they do have an LGBT problem. Some friends and I signed a whole. I don't know if you saw it. Yeah. And we're doing what we can to change things on the ground. I think you can't also sit in the West and tell a country what to do. So it's about sort of forming alliances on the ground and seeing what is needed and how we can help. Whether than standing on our soap boxes, going, do this, do that, do this. So that's through what grounds, I mean, ground work trying to change from within. Yes, from within. Trying to change from within, you know, talking to heads of LGBTQ, LGBTQ members and asking them what they need and what we can do to help. Rather than, you know, I'll say, do this. This is how you do it because we don't live there. You have a memoir out. Yeah. Why put it down on paper? You know, something about when you turn 50. You know, something about when it's your fifth year of vote, you know, I got married this year. I'm normally not someone who looks back all the time, but it felt like the right time for me to do that. And also, you know, I just felt that a lot of young people see people like you and I and they think, you know, we just got here. We were always here and for me was really important to share the story of a journey about, you know, successors and, and, you know, failures. And, you know, that's the reason why I got here. So I just wanted to share that story with them. Sort of young people. That's what those people who, you know, feel like they're on the outskirts of, you know, the outside of the industry, really. Do you feel like an outsider? I think I'll always feel like an outsider, but I just said before, you know, I grew up African in an African household in England, you know, different languages, different foods, and I now go to school and I've been in England. So I've always been about duality. I've always seen myself as an outsider, but I was also an insider. And even when, you know, I took the job at British folk, I was the black gay working class outsider, but, you know, I've been in the industry since I was 18. So I was, in essence, an insider. So that's really, it's the mother duality that plays out in my life. What, who do you think made you the person you are today? I know you left home twice, right, Ghana, but also you had to leave your home. Yes. I mean, the person made me who I mean, really is my mother. I mean, I mean, I loved my mother. She taught me about sort of beauty. She taught me about clothes, about fascists. She also taught me that beauty came in all forms that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1293,2022-11-20 20:21:35
18680," She taught me about beauty, she taught me about clothes, about fascist, she also taught me that beauty came in all forms. That women were beautiful, no matter what shape they were, no matter what colour, what religion. So that really stayed with me and I guess my creativity comes from her. And of course I also had a military father, so the idea of precision and organization and thinking ahead also comes from him. So the best of both worlds. How did your father, I know you had a difficult relation with your father, how did your father shape the person you are today? It's a funny, I should ask this question because I never thought I was like my father growing up. I was very shy, very sensitive, a little spacey. I prefer the company of women, to men, my dad was sort of a sort of a therian, disciplinarian. You know you had to be home at a certain time. He grew up as an iron fist. And I thought I'm never going to be like him, he kicked me out of the house when I was 18. But I found out that over the years when it comes to work and discipline and sort of organization that is him to a team. So really a reminder isn't it just how sensitive the markets are to any commentary about trade. We did see some pressure on the UI and we did see some pressure on the future. That is now being reversed. Before you change the world, Bloomberg. So at some point you lose your eyesight. What was that like? Yeah, basically I have sort of very high my opias. I've never had great eyesight and I went through a series of retinal detachments for to be exact. And with each detachment I would sort of have to end up looking down in a contraption for about three weeks. And in the dark room, it was very harrowing, it was very harrowing time in my life. But I always say you know you don't have to have vision to have vision. So in those dark rooms my imagination was even bigger. I dream bigger. And I came out of sort of the last surgery and the cover I did was for W Magazine with Rihanna as the queen, with a golden eye. And I look back at the other letter. Oh my god, there are the eyes. Subliminally. So yes, it was very challenging. And even to this day, I go for checkups to make sure my eyes are okay. And they're great right now. And you know, once the more I look after myself, the better, the better I'll get. But it's amazing, you power through adversity. Do you ever think actually this is too much? Have you ever thought this is too much? I mean there have been times when I felt this is too much, but it's not in my vocabulary to start. It's not in my DNA to start.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1294,2022-11-20 20:25:46
18681," Well, this is too much, but it's not in my vocabulary to start. It's not in my DNA to start. You know, I am my mother's son, my father's son. You know, the edge to move forward is always there. And that's why, you know, when I was young, I would always get up and work. I had a recording to touch, but I still got on a plane to go shoot the Hollywood put folio. But now I'm learning to say no. Now I'm learning I can't do that job. I can't fly. No, it takes time, but it comes with age. It takes courage to say no, right? Definitely. So when you look at all your covers, and there are so many beautiful ones, is there one that's special to you? Well, did I say to someone, they're like my children. You always have a favorite home. But I'm especially proud of the covers we did in lockdown, you know, when the world had essentially shut down, you know, the teams were sort of scattered all around London. And I had to go back to the days of I did when, you know, you had to really create and use your imagination. And we had a series of four covers, Judy Dinch, when they said, you know, anybody over 60, she stayed at home, the essential workers cover, a cover of landscapes, just so people could take a breather. And the activists cover when George Floyd was murdered. And I really think we create covers that, you know, in years time, people can look back and see what the time, that period was like for me, an artist always has to reflect their times, as Nina, to paraphrase Nina Simone, and that's really important for me. I mean, there was a bit of controversy with Linda van Gelistand. Yes. Yes, I mean, you know, there was a, there was a complaint that, oh, you know, she should, she should have looked a certain way, you know. And for me, I've not lived in the 90s. I've known this incredible icon who really defined what a model should be. And I also saw my friend go through really dark days, you know, due to the complications for surgery, literally disappear from the world, really not the Linda the world news. So when we were doing this cover, it was a collaboration. She wanted to be that Linda that everybody knew. She wanted to feel good about herself again. And I wasn't going to deny her that act. And also, you know, whatever I would like to say, whatever a woman wants to do with her body, it's up to her. So, you know, I'm very proud of Linda and I'm very proud of that cover. And I mean, some of that, you're almost like an activist. Is that how you, you're like a fashion activist or a political fashion? I'm a leader, I'm a fashion. I'm a leader, I'm a fashion. But I'm definitely a creative, but, you know, I've always believed, you know, look at my, my life story in my book, you know. I wasn't like, I keep saying I wasn't supposed to be here, you know, have my dad not left, I don't know even what would have happened to my family. So even when we ended up in a room, two rooms in a voxel, six of us, we were so happy to be there, penniless, but so happy to be there. So, you know, every day, I just, you know, I'm an optimist and I know it's not the most fashionable thing, but that's why I'm sitting here with you today. Bye. Edward, thank you so much for your time today. Thank you. So, is there more pressure when you're trying to win a basketball championship than when you're trying to please investors? Where's the greater pressure? Oh, I think, I think it's definitely trying to win a championship. It's hard because a lot of, like, when you invest and you know this, when you're investing, you can control a lot more things. When, you know, in a basketball court, you can't control whether somebody's going to make a shot, you've got to get lucky. And what's the greater pleasure making five times your money on a distressed debt investment or winning the NBA championship? They're both fabulous. I wish I could do one each year. That would be great. But I think there's a great feeling in being right on an investment that you've done a tremendous amount of work and you've made money for your clients, which I think is great. I think winning a championship is, it's a very surreal feeling because there's a whole city.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1295,2022-11-20 20:30:24
18682," your clients, which I think is great. I think winning a championship is, it's a very surreal feeling because there's a whole city or state that is actually behind you. You know, we had 70,000 people at the finals and we had them all outside. It's 17,000 in stands and then literally like 60,000 people outside. And when we won, like just the joy that you brought to the city was phenomenal. Big, expensive cities have a lot going for them. But if you live in one, you've probably noticed that these big, expensive cities keep getting more, well, expensive. You could always move away. You might have just started working remotely. So there's really nothing keeping you there. But then again, moving is a hassle. Well, what if someone cade you 10 grand to do it? What if they threw in free office space, a bicycle or a gym membership? Programs and cities and states around the US are doing exactly that and they're getting a lot of interest. We had over 50,000 applications. About 90,000 applications. We had over 1800 applicants from all over North America. So are these nascent programs actually beneficial to their communities and the workers joining them? Or are they little more than flashy advertising campaigns for places looking for an injection of fresh talent? Before the COVID pandemic upended the way the world does business, logistics was one of those industries that might have been taken for granted. That's not the case anymore. Due to all the turbulences over the last two years, customers are now realizing how important it is to have a reliable logistics partner on their side. Our people are doing a quite complex job. People think, oh, they just deliver passes somewhere. That's an easy thing. If you think about what our people are doing, it's quite complex. Businesses and consumers are suddenly thinking a lot more about how things they need reach places where they're needed. It's thrust the sector into the spotlight. Logistics and supply chain has become a household need. It's dramatically different than pre-pandemic. Yes, it's grown whether that's in market power, revenue, profitability, investor interest. For Deutsche Post DHL Group, that's created opportunity to build on momentum and set ambitious goals for service and performance. When you look at our footprint, we're the most international logistics company there is. We want to become more digital and we want to be much more sustainable than we have been. DP DHL's revenue has soared since 2020 with full-year profit nearly doubling in 2021. CFO, Melanie Christ is a key leader of the team that's delivered these results. And she views her role as much more than just a number crunch. There are unfortunately these clichés that finance is boring and it's kind of like being counting in the back office to be successful in finance. I mean, you have to have the financial expertise, right? But we also have to be credible business leaders in order to really impact the business and steer the direction. She is extremely smart and bright. You need somebody who is able to digest a lot of information that are rapidly and can distinguish what is important, what is less important. She has tremendous skill in that. And she's not afraid to call people out, to call out other members of the executive team if she feels that something isn't being. She does that in a very nice way actually. She helps me tremendously in steering the company because she is highly regarded by my other colleagues in the senior team and typically if they have a problem they share for us with her before they come to me. When I think about the conversations I have with Frank, the shortest part is actually about the analysis and the facts. It's more the debate about, okay, on that basis, what are the options? What can we do? My role is essentially saying in three sentences, what is working well in this company? Where do we have challenges and what should we do going forward?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1296,2022-11-20 20:34:33
18683," Where do we have challenges and what should we do going forward? Deutsche Post DHL Group consists of five divisions. Express Germany's Post and Parcel Service, Global Forwarding and Freight, Supply Chain and E-commerce Solutions. Each of these segments has seen revenue growth in the last four years, while the surge of E-commerce volume during the pandemic has had a direct impact on the trajectory. E-commerce is a very structural and fundamental growth for us as a company. What we now saw under the pandemic was a structural acceleration. It took us forward to a point in terms of e-compennaturation, which we probably would have reached on enormous circumstances in three years' time. So it was a big step forward. DP DHL was well prepared to take this step. The company's strategic plan recognised E-commerce as a growing trend in the logistics landscape, but no one could have forecast the speed and breadth of the transformation. What we are now seeing that also under the pandemic, not only domestic e-commerce has taken a faster growth of the global growth of e-commerce, but also cross-border e-commerce. We see that clearly in our express network, but also in our e-commerce solutions division. What are the other big structural shifts that you see on the horizon? Is it e-commerce B2B? Is it increased trade as globalisation restructures? What are the shifts that you're seeing? The board B2B e-commerce is still at a very early stage, so we believe that there will be a huge growth opportunity there. We also see that when we are talking to our customers now, I guess everybody has been now realised that being dependent on just one supplier in one province in one country is probably not a good idea. So they want to build more resilience into the supply chain. I think our international footprint, our global strengths, is really something we can leverage for the benefit of our customers. Another factor in the company's favour is its balance sheet. Since Melanie Christ became CFO, Cacheflow has improved significantly. One of my priorities over the last years has been to really focus the whole organisation on better cash generation. It's not just a finance job. Making sure that ultimately revenue converts into EBIT and into Cache in the bank account is the responsibility of the whole organisation. She says, we can't be successful as a company. If we are not collecting the cash for our services, we have provided. She has not missed one single opportunity to talk about that. I think it's a very comfortable situation, particularly in the current environment, to have a strong balance sheet. In that respect, I'm very conservative, and I'd rather have a bit more on the balance sheet and a bit more buffer. Spell out for us what the priorities are, the longer-term priorities, in terms of putting some of that cash to use for you. The first priority here is organic growth. We clearly indicated also that it's our KEPEX budget, 12 billion for the next three years, that we will keep investing into organic growth. We are very focused on our regular dividend payment. And then, if there is something left, which is, fortunately, the case at the moment, we will think about inorganic opportunities, and we will also think about other means to allow our shareholders to participate. That is why we are currently running a 2 billion euro share-by-back program. Inorganic opportunities include M&A, like the recent purchase of beverage shipper, Hila Brand. But deploying cash is always subject to careful consideration. Does Melanie ever turn around and say, no, when you're pushing through or pushing for a particular package of spending? Yes, she does that quite often, you know, because she has... She is a person, and that's great, if you have a CEO who is risk-abuse, because you need somebody. You know, the business is always too optimistic. Melanie might be something too pessimistic, but that's a very healthy discussion. And if we then jointly come through the same conclusion after a debate, then we are probably in the right spot. How often do you find yourself saying no to divisional heads? So when I was promoted into the CFO position, my team gave...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1297,2022-11-20 20:38:58
18684," How often do you find yourself saying no to divisional heads? When I was promoted into the CFO position, my team gave me a stamp with rejected. It sits on my desk. I think the fact that people know it sits there already has instilled quite a lot of discipline in the organization. So I think when I get a proposal, it has already gone through a number of iterations and is normally of such a high quality that I don't need to reject it a stamp too often. For the time being, Christ should be able to keep that stamp in a drawer. CEO Frank Uppell has expressed a commitment to service quality and confidence that customers will accept higher prices that come with it. It is too expensive, you will be out of business, but if you don't provide the right quality, you will be out of business as well. So we want to be, we will never be the cheapest in town that's not doable, we are the premium provider, that's our strategy. Of course, it's also more challenging for us when our customers are under pressure. At the same time, I think, over all the last two years have shown that reliable high quality supply chain comes at a certain price tag. I finally see that inflation is having a huge impact on the logistics industry and there's been substantial price increases in the last few years. I do not see that changing, there's a lot of innovation happening and I don't see the inflation necessarily going away, it might level out a bit, but it's not going to go away. The logistics companies may have pricing power with customers, but their stock prices haven't been so robust. I think that the issue there is the increase in interest rates has made everyone rethink and be concerned about the level of inventory that is out in the system, if you will, with the level of disruption. What's happening more in the last 303 months is there's more of a view that we're actually heading into. Certainly, any coming slow down may be a recession. With more than half its revenue coming from Europe, investors may see DP DHL as more exposed to recession risks than its global peers. The company insists it can meet its revenue targets in the event of a downturn. It's counting on diversification as a cushion. I'm not so pessimistic that there is really a deep recession at our doorstep, but even then, our portfolio is very much balanced. We are everywhere in the world, but we will not go entirely into recession. Would it be a stretch to suggest that DP DHL is to some extent recession proof? I wouldn't go as far as to say recession proof, but I think we are very well positioned to deal with all different types of recession scenarios. Due to the breadth of the portfolio, the balance of the portfolio really gives us a lot of resilience against any type of headwind. Coming up, a look at DP DHL's investments in action. Melanie Christ shows me around the company's state of the art and logistics hub. What I love about this building is it actually shows the big mega trends which formed our strategy 2025. This is Bloomberg. Japan's critical role in the global economy is changing as the world recalibrates. After decades of stagnation, Japan's leaders are forging a more innovative and sustainable path forward to revitalise the nation. Corporate giants, policymakers and pioneers tell us how they're doing just that. Every week on Japan ahead, right here on Bloomberg Television. As the chief financial officer of one of the world's largest logistics companies, Melanie Christ has made her mark in global business. That's not what she originally attended to do. I really wanted to go into research, I wanted to become a physicist and that was where my passion was. But then doing my studies, some friends of mine started doing this strange thing, they eventually...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1298,2022-11-20 20:43:11
18685," which I wanted to become a physicist, and that was where my passion was. But then during my studies, some friends of mine started doing this strange thing. They went into management consulting. I didn't even know how to spell it. And I had no idea what it was about. But what they told me was quite interesting. And so I ended up doing an internship with a consulting firm. And I learned more in the two months there than I had in the last two years in my physics job at university. That is how I ended up in consulting. She started her career with three years at McKinsey, then spent four years in private equity with APAC's partners in London, before joining Deutsche Post DHL Group in 2004. I was brought into the company to do international M&A project. That was at the time around 20 years ago when we were really building the company in the current shape, acquiring lots of logistics companies around the world. The M&A part was the first thing. And I then wandered into a more mainstream finance field here in the group, becoming the CFO of our DHL Express Division. So from then on, it was more leading towards the CFO role, eventually. Melanie Christ now heads the finance team with around 11,000 employees. Success in this role is as much an art as a science. If you do the greatest piece of analysis, and you see it all, and you know it all, but you can't convey that message, and you can't convince the rest of the organization that we should move into a certain direction, it's useless. DHL is sending a consistent message with its investments. The company spent 123 million euros to upgrade its logistics centre at the Clone Bon Airport, designing it around key strategic goals. What I love about this building is it actually shows the big mega trends which formed our strategy 2025, which was inaugurated in 2019 when this building opened. So, globalization, connecting the world. E-commerce, we have a lot of sortation facilities here for smaller e-commerce shipments. Sustainability, it's a very sustainable building, there's solar panels on the roof and everything, and digitalisation, and well, you can obviously see that it is quite automated. How did the team pitch this investment to you initially? And how hard was it as a sell for them? How quickly did you turn around and say, yes, this is worth 123 million euros? Of course, you always have to make sure that you have the right capacity for the growth in the network. And at that time, they came and said, hey, we will really see a strong growth in e-commerce volumes on top of the regular B2B growth. We need more sorting capacity, we need this building. And of course, there are always debates, does it really have to cost 123 million euros and so on? But fortunately, they convinced us, because then with COVID and the volume search, we urgently needed the capacity. At the same time as COVID accelerated demand for logistic services, disruptions in the labour supply hurt productivity. Advances and technology like this digital sauter have helped offset some pressures, but automation also raises questions. Does this tell us that this is the business grows? This is going to become a more automated business, but there's going to be less need for labour, for workers. Well, you still see people here, and I think what you can nicely witness here is the combination of technology which supports people. So, for example, when you look at the customs area, it used to be a very manual and sometimes confusing process. Now, the people are supported in picking the right chipmins for customs inspections by light and they are automatically sorted in this sort of, to go to customs inspections. So, it is also the helping the people with the jobs they're doing here every day. We overset in 2019-20. We might get one-third less jobs in the current setup until 2030, if we digitalise the organisation, but we are very sure that our company will be at least 50, maybe 100% bigger, and we will have more jobs to offer. At the beginning of a couple of years ago, when we started that journey, people said, oh, you know, I might lose my job, I haven't heard that in the last two years as a question in the town hall. This airport hub also showcases DP DHL's aviation fleet, which boasts more than 320 dedicated cargo aircraft.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1299,2022-11-20 20:47:34
18686," This airport hub also showcases DP DHL's aviation fleet, which both small than 320 dedicated cargo aircraft. The biggest tank of our aircraft, but we also have short and medium and long-term visas and visit growth in our business. We anticipate that the people keep going. You've talked about investing, of course, in sustainable fuel. Yes. When does that come online? How significant is it? Is it just the critics might say that's just window dressing around a part of the business that is, of course, very, very carbon intensive, at least a lot of emissions? Yes. So you absolutely write the problem with our beautiful aircraft is the CO2 emissions. And when you look at our overall CO2 emissions, two-thirds are from aviation. It is about flying these birds with more sustainable fuel. And we said that we're really willing to spend billions on it. We now really hope that we will see the uptick and supply over the next years. Spending billions isn't vague hyperbole. The company has pledged to put seven billion euros towards sustainable technologies and fuels by 2030 with a goal of climate neutral logistics by 2050. Sustainability makes good business sense anyway, especially if you are in a business that is energy or fuel hungry as a compliance element that not just operators in the logistics sector need to consider, but also their customers. So being transparent becomes part of the service about their impact on the globe. We had a lengthy discussion. Should we make a financial commitment? How much we want to invest for the next decade in our sustainability? We had a long debate is at right to say we want to invest seven billion to 2030. There were pros and cons. But that was a very intense discussion melody in I-Hart, where we finally came to the conclusion that this is a right number. This is a right approach. We convinced our colleague and that's the reason why we are where we are. We are seeing somebody who really commit. They're not that many companies who have quantified their future investment. Still ahead, how one of the business world's most influential women is working to strengthen gender equality within her company. I think the great thing is that now across the board in finance, but also in the group overall, we have role models which show young female talent that everything is possible. This is Bloomberg. It is crucially important. And I think we've moved from this attitude, from its endolgyns, a waste of time, almost an illness that needs a cure. For something as universally important to human life as sleep, mysteries surrounding its necessity and utility have only just been recently uncovered. Some of our biggest discoveries were in the 1970s or 1980s, and so it makes that a really exciting field, because it seems as though we're uncovering new insights each and every day. Some scientists are going further to find out how sleep and what happens there can be harnessed to further expand our understanding. It's easy to memorize things that makes you smart. If you can spit back a lot of facts, but if you want to be wise, if you really want wisdom, you've got to know when and how and why to use that information. And that's what your brain figures out while you're sleeping. No one covers the world like Bloomberg. The writings on the wall for the bank of England just don't oil has spray painted the front door. Recession in Europe, UK, and possibly the US. The millions that are out in full force celebrating election victory. A former president, Lula, that's Gilbap. With unmatched reach in resources from more than 120 countries, the moment news breaks 24 hours a day.

18687," PERFECT Do it your post DHL Group CFO Melanie Christ is often named to lists of the most powerful women in business. And while men still outnumber women as finance heads of large companies, there are signs that the balance is shifting. The number of female CFOs across major US companies has risen to an all time high, according to a study by Chris Colder Associates. And executive search firm Cohen Partners reports that 36% of new CFOs hired by notable companies in the first half of 2022 were women. I ask Melanie Christ if she's encountered obstacles as a woman rising through the executive ranks. I have to say I have not made many negative experiences. Maybe I was also a little bit naive not thinking about these challenges so much. So I mean, when I studied physics, there weren't many women, so I was somehow always used to it. And it can also be an advantage when you're kind of like the only girl in the room. I mean, the boss at the end remembers your name and not the 19 guys who all kind of like wear dark suits and white shirts and look alike, right? So I never experienced it as an external stress factor. I have to say for me personally it was more balancing my own expectations around kind of like getting family and the job combined. But that was probably more of a pressure I put on myself thinking that I had to be perfect in every dimension and not something where the pressure was put on me from my male colleagues. So how do you take that experience and put it to play in terms of how you advance the role of women in this organization? I think the great thing is that now across the board in finance but also in the group overall, we have role models which show young female talent that everything is possible. In finance, we have a share of women in management of 32%, so we are ahead of the group. We want to get to 35% by 2025. I think we are now at a position where if we have a vacancy, I want to have at least one woman on the short list because we have enough female talent. So every short list should contain a woman and then the best person in the race should win. CEO Frank Appell says Christ sets an example for the entire organization. He believes her success may influence the entire industry. She has proven that she is an outstanding CEO for all and she is definitely a role model in many dimensions that you know what I like about there. She is still you know a very warm and nice person and that makes such a big difference. So you can get to that level without compromising on how nice you are as a person. I think she is a great role model and I hope that this has had positive impact for many of us. From the big picture down to the smallest operational details, Melanie Christ is fully engaged in guiding DP DHL into the future. I wanted to know what she sees when she looks ahead. What do you see as the biggest opportunities for DP DHL over the next 10 years? I think we have a fantastic portfolio and we just have to leverage the growth opportunities which are there both on the ECOM site and also on the traditional B2B site and the key differentiators for us will be digitalisation, sustainability and our great people. As you look ahead 10 years, what are some of the challenges? What keeps you up at night as you think about the business going forward? I think we have to keep this focus and the ability to adjust in a very agile way. Sometimes when you kind of think about all the risk controlling and stuff, people tend to create an impression that you can preplan everything, that's clearly not the case.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1301,2022-11-20 20:56:36
18688," I think about all the risk controlling and stuff. People tend to create the impression that you can pre-plan everything. That's clearly not the case. So I think we have to stay focused and keep the ability to react in a very agile way. But looking at what happened over the last 24 months, I'm very optimistic that we will also be able to cope with whatever happens next. And how do you see your role changing in the years ahead? I think it is changing at a very rapid pace, which is a great thing because it never gets boring. Those elements I just mentioned for the group overall, digitalization and sustainability are also hugely relevant for the finance role. It's like a new language you have to learn. And you learn the vocabulary, but then you also have to develop a feeling if I kind of like put so much capital into this decarbonization measure, I get so much in terms of return out of it. But that's a fascinating opportunity where we can make a huge difference for finance and for the group overall. As you look to the future, Melanie, what do you think is going to be the skill sets, the knowledge bases, they're going to be essential to the success of future CFOs? Yes, probably the two most essential new skills will be to get even better at lifelong learning, because we will have to learn so much new stuff every year. Be it in the digitalization area, be it on sustainability. So this ability also has a 50-year plus-old person to keep learning and keep the curiosity. I think that is going to be super essential. And the second element will be being a great team player. The word is complex. You can't know it all. So you really have to work even more strongly with your team. What advice would you give to someone who's just recently been appointed CFO? That's a great question. I think I would probably simply say, be curious and ask as many questions as you can, try to learn as much as possible, not only in the finance area, but get close to the business, try to really understand the business, because only when you are close to the business and you understand the fundamental profit drivers will you be a really great CFO. I'm Tom McKenzie. This is Bloomberg. I'm going to name a couple of your babies. I don't know if I'm asking you to choose amongst your children, but some of the most recognizable buildings by, of course, the Millennium Bridge, London City Hall, the Reichstag, and the Great Court British Museum. What was your favorite project to do? The Reichstag does stand out, because, first of all, it's an energy manifesto. So it transforms something that was dependent on fossil fuels. It uses all the technology to produce something which is essentially carbon neutral, and there's a public building. That's a statement. It's a symbol of a city. It's a symbol of a nation. It incorporates works of art. It's recycling an existing building, which, as I mentioned earlier, is the ultimate in sustainability. If you can get a new life to a building, it also creates public space at the roof level. It's the most visited parliament in the world, so it puts the public above the politicians who are answerable to them. And that, of course, was made possible by the politicians. So it's a demonstration of democracy in action. We will never break. We will never break. Build on a foundation strong enough to stay. We will never break.

It means they have a Bloomberg I think that it's hard to put your head around any narrative Let's just be honest We've had sort of a shift in Are we in some sort of circulation fears? Moment, people were talking about that all day yesterday A week of hope about inflation and interest rates About China's relations with the United States About Britain getting serious about its budget And of course, former President Trump's hope That he can do it all again This is Bloomberg Wall Street week I'm David Weston This week, special contributor Larry Summers On what came out of the G20 meetings in Bali And former Fed Vice Chair Rich Clarita On the liquidity problem in the Treasury's market And what can be done about it? It was a week of hoping Hoping that things just might start to move in a better direction in US-China relations After a President Biden's meeting in Bali with President Xi I absolutely believe there's need not be a new Cold War I do not think there's any imminent attempt on the part of China to invade Taiwan And I made it clear that our policy in Taiwan has not changed at all Hoping that inflation may just be easing a bit in the United States With Fed Vice Chair Leo Brainer telling Bloomberg We might see a bit of moderation in rate hikes I think it will probably be appropriate to move to a slower pace of increases But I think what's really important to emphasize, we've done a lot But we have additional work to do both on raising rates and sustaining restraint to bring inflation down Hoping that the new British government has gotten the message As it put forth a new budget designed to reassure the markets So today we deliver a plan to tackle the cost of living crisis and rebuild our economy Our priorities are stability, growth and public services And then of course there's that special kind of hope the former President Trump brings to everything he does Deciding that despite what happened in the midterms to his hand-picked candidates This was the right time to announce he's running again for President In order to make America great and glorious again I am tonight announcing my candidacy for President of the United States Even as prominent investor and Republican supporter Ken Griffin of Citadel Couldn't find much to hope for in Mr. Trump's candidacy He lost in 2020 We lost Georgia because of his behavior in the Senate race in 2020 That's the second loss And then this year the Republicans lost the Senate because the Trump-backed candidates in the Senate races were rejected by American voters That's a three-time loser And I'd like to think that the Republican party's ready to move on from somebody who's been for this party a three-time loser But whatever we were all hoping for this week we didn't really get that much out of the markets Which traded without real conviction with the S&P 500 off just 7 tens of a percent for the week And the Nasdaq down 1.57 percent And the yield on the 10 year up about 7 basis points in the week at 3.82 To help us sort it all out we welcome now a sunny bachelor CEO of Rock",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1303,2022-11-20 21:05:05
18690, point five seven percent and the yield on the ten year up about seven basis points ending the week at three point eight two to help us sort of all out welcome now a sunny best of us CEO of rock creek and bob michael he's chief investment officer and head of the global fixed income unit at jp more than asset management so welcome both you great to have you back but let me start with you i mean i watched the eco numbers i listened to the feds big i sort of felt like i was going both ways at the same time what did you see well for a bond investor all of us who have been battered this year this is one of the weeks that made sense to us we had a nice tailwind coming in from the inflation data it was great all the way through core when you look at shelter everything yes the markets went a little crazy they went while and the central bankers did what they're supposed to do they came in one by one and reminded us don't declare victory yet these are only a couple prints there are more hikes to come but maybe there is some optimism and the market settled down so i look at this week and i thought this is the first great week in a long time so if sonny is that the way you saw it as well and there's still some more rage hikes to come how many i think at least another three to start with 50 basis points next time in December followed by at least two or three 25 basis points next year and then we'll see from there and i think what Bob said is very true at the same time as we were listening to at least three fed people come and speak i wrote down i think they all had i wrote down i think they all had very different coats and you had some of that when labor not talked but you also had the president of saint Louis fed say something slightly different as if you know we would start continue we would continue with rate increases for a while longer than she had implied and then of course we had Susan Collins coming today with even you know sort of potential 75 basis points so we're hearing numbers that are a little bit all over the place and trying to make sense of it so Bob the market's making it harder for the fed as a practical matter um they were at the start of the week i think not so much now i think we're all in the same spot we've all got realistic expectations the fed's headed to four and a half five percent they'll get there sometime in the first quarter we'll see where inflation is if it's below the fed funds rate then that gives them some scope to pause on the tightening we can reevaluate at that point but right now bon yields have gone up a long way in a very short period of time it's time for a breath Bob does that get us to a soft landing? unfortunately it does not and i think that's the one consistent message from the fed Susan Collins aside which is there is going to be pain for businesses and households when you have this magnitude of rate hikes in such a short period and you're also withdrawing liquidity through quantitative tightening it's going to bite and we're already seeing it's biting the economy hard thankfully it's also now starting to bite inflation so i want to think about the liquidity just for a moment if i could have sunny how big a problem do we have in the treasury market now with the liquidity i hear conflicting things but some people are very concerned about it big problems i think Bob leaves it much more than i do but as as you know they're very very uh big problems with the trading volumes and and for big traders or even small traders getting uh bit is becoming much harder and you're working in a much less liquid liquid environment and i know between treasury and the banks there have been a lot of meetings but i'm not so sure if we have a solution yet well Bob could the fed make it easier with some regulatory change changes um it could but i think the moaning that we hear in the bond market about liquidity it's always there we always complain we don't get the price we want the reality is for the last couple weeks you could have moved your portfolio in any direction you wanted up and down duration up and down credit risk without any kind of penalty so i'm not that big a believer in the lack of liquidity i'm sorry when we talk about a soft landing it brings me back to oil because oil did move this week and it moved down in the price of oil and most people i talked to suggested it was in part because of a concern about global recession really a backing off or at least a softening,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1304,2022-11-20 21:09:14
18691," Landing, it brings me back to oil because oil did move this week and it moved down in the price of oil and most people I talked to suggested it was in part because of a concern about global recession really a backing off or at least a softening in the markets. You came out of that business. You really know energy backwards and forwards. What are we seeing in oil? So as you said, oil prices did the future numbers went down below 80, which was a big shift from a little while ago. But my view is still that we might just avoid a recession in the U.S. if we're fortunate. But we may not be able to avoid it in Europe and the rest of the world. And a lot of the, I think, softness for these numbers that we saw today and in recent days is because of the expectations in China. Now, China is starting to open up a little bit maybe and loosen its COVID rules. But that's going to take a while and I think that softening is softening the oil markets and will probably continue to do that. Is it opening up? I mean, I'm not exactly sure exactly what's happening because on the one hand we hear them saying things that sound a little softer on zero COVID and in the end we hear about a lot of cases. So it is, it was kind of interesting. We have a team out in Asia this week and they came back with interesting news that there is actually some physical open up. But now you have people who are afraid to go out because they've been told so long that if they go out they'll get COVID. And so you have seen a very different phenomenon which is actual, you know, individuals not wanting to go out of their houses versus the government which has been very strict about you're getting out of your house. I'm sorry, I was at the G20, of course, many of them are Bali and some people thought there would be no single statement coming out of it. They did come to some agreement in part driven by some of the developing countries. Should that be encouraging to investors actually that we're getting back perhaps a little toward multilateral cooperation. Much more positive news came out of the G20 than we all expected. And as you said, there was also a lot of big stress on reform of the multilateral lending because the big news out of that meeting was that there's huge needs when it comes particularly to emerging markets. Climate related investments and there's no way with the existing finances of the multilateral that that could be met. So that was why there was a lot of emphasis on the reform of the multilateral sector but also getting the multilateral to work much better with the private sector to generate more resources. And you saw that very particular case of Indonesia, which was discussed a lot and written up a lot with about 20 billion going into to replace call in Indonesia with cleaner fuels. About another important development this week is sort of a rolling development is the outcomes of the midterm elections. We found out that the Democrats will hold on to the Senate. The Republicans will get a narrow majority in the House. What is that communicate if anything to investors? Is that sort of a steady as you go way because we have a split government not much is going to happen either way? So it for sure is I will tell you going back to the G20 we're actually hearing from clients large institutional clients that they're more confident about allocating to markets when the G20 countries are talking to one another again and working with one another again. So that's a huge positive. I don't remember that in gosh over a decade. When you go back to the gridlock in Washington, I hate to say it, but the markets kind of like it. It's when there are dramatic policy changes. You have to reprice everything in the markets. It becomes destabilizing. There are always going to be some winners. There are going to be some losers. This time if we know we're going to have gridlock, we can focus on bringing inflation down and trying to avoid a recession and have a soft land. I think a lot of people in the street think that it's sort of hypocritic. First do no harm. If you're not doing anything, you're not messing things up. Bob Michael of JPMorgan and I'm sorry, a bachelor's of rock week. We'll be staying with us as we look at what this week meant for our investment decisions. That's the next time Wall Street Week.

18692," Hey you have a philosophy. Hirojin has a very special place in the universe. It's the first element on the periodic table. It is the most abandoned element in the universe. And when clean energy advocates think about what can we find which would be as easy to use as fossil fuels they think about hydrogen. The fuel that will when burn only produce water. We like to imagine that if we just built enough of these and these we could ditch fossil fuels and save the planet. Unfortunately it's not that simple. There are some things we just need a good old fashioned combustible fuel. Now startups around the world are betting that hydrogen can become the fuel of the 21st century. We think it will create some of the most valuable companies the market's ever seen. And I think it's certainly driven companies like Cisco given them the life that they've had. Obviously also spectacularly volatile but the market has pulled back since it began in 1995 it's pulled back 30 to 50% at least seven or eight times. That was Henry Blodget talking about the internet and tech on Wall Street way back in June of 2000 when the number one movie in the country was Mission Impossible 2 and the most popular song in the country was Maria Moria by Santana. Bob Michael of JPMorgan and Sonny Bachelors of Rod Creek are still with us. So of Sonny certainly Mr. Blodget was right that we gave us some awfully big and successful companies no question about it. Some people thought that would happen as well in the crypto space. This week we're not quite as sure after FTX. What do we make of that? Is that it does that have broader significance of the markets or is it just a one off? Hopefully it is more limited. I think there's no question that with that regulation and we've all been talking about having this sector regulated it would help. It's the market itself but also the investors going in. And this particular come FTX which is an exchange core crypto based in the Bahamas with not just no regulation but also with few people who had very limited experience in finance or in anything really. I think the shocking part of it David was that very very sophisticated venture firms from Sequoia and others who were invested. It was not just retail getting involved in that market. So it was a surprise but hopefully it will get limited and I think it has put a lot of pressure on increasing regulation sooner here and that will be a good thing for the market. Now let's not forget that the whole market is less than you know at 900 billion. I'm not saying that that's tiny but it's still not significant enough to create any kind of stress in the market unless we're missing something that we don't know at this point. I think what's important David when you watch that clip and that was the absolute peak in the dot com bubble. Yes, there was a massive shakeout. There was a massive consolidation but I would argue the internet and tech evolved far beyond what any of us ever thought it would be in 2000. I wonder if we're going through the same thing with Chris.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1306,2022-11-20 21:18:05
18693," But I would argue the internet and tech evolved far beyond would any of us ever thought it would be in 2000 I wonder if we're going through the same thing with crypto and NFTs that it got a great start There is going to be a shakeout of Sonya's right There's probably going to be a lot of regulation But when I talk to the young people on our desk and our platform There's still a big believer and if the millennials are a believer 22 years from now They're going to be looking at this clip and I hope we got it right. That's fascinating There is a no question as a generational issue here. Let's come back to the current generation and people who's old as I am I'm older than you are, but it's all I'm what about bonds right now do you invest in bonds? for the first time in a decade Absolutely and and I will tell you that we're seeing interest from everywhere now every wealth management platform in J.P. Morgan Every institutional client they're coming to us. They're putting money in bonds They're looking to commit more and they haven't done so for years If I look at where we got to at the start of the year a general bond fund the The the Bloomberg Ag yielded 1.7 percent now we're up at 4.7 percent We have 3 percent higher yields and that's going to track investment and as I said I think the Fed is close to the end. I don't know if they get to 5 percent We're kind of in the 4.5 4 and 3.4 percent That's going to bring a lot of stability to the market at these levels bonds are back So I'm saying you manage a fair amount of money. What about for you or bonds attractive at this point or you just equities? I Think as said what is very interesting right now is even in any Foundation or endowment or the assets that we manage You're finding the exactly the same phenomena where people had moved away from bonds and cash and we're all equities and and private investments moving back into holding bonds and as we're sort of reaching that 4.5 percent that Bob talked about Much more interest in bonds in a more balanced kind of portfolio and of course people are looking at cash with 4 percent With treasury bills at the level that is much higher than cash was earned in a very long time But I think the bigger thing that is happening in the portfolios we're looking at is obviously a lot of Investors institution investors have been also investing in venture private equity Real estate in private form and I think that is going to some sort of transformation too Well, let's let's take a segue if we could from that sort of investment in the COP27 As we're speaking right now it's still going to end on Saturday right now of sunny you know far better than I do It looks like it's going to be difficult for them to get to the objectives that they had You're absolutely right so far as we know Tonight the latest news was not too positive. Not things could change tomorrow morning But they didn't really have anything major to announce again as you remember remember in COP26 they had the G-Fans which was A large number of large asset managers signing up to make pretty significant shifts in their carbon print but Most recently they started walking back from that or not wanting to sign quite on what they had agreed to into in COP26 So I think it's very very important as we're having these meetings Maybe they shouldn't be every year Maybe they should be every other year or less often but show some sort of progress and the most important part of the discussion this time David Has been a fact that developing countries again have felt that they are in some cases Suffering because if they're an island economy they're going underwater if they are affected by by droughts and by floods A lot of it might be caused by those who did use a lot of carbon over the last ten twenty years and they're asking if they could get help and That help is really not coming and I think that is the really major Summary of COP27 which is that the expectations of Investments into climate are probably less than what we expected going into the COP What and just pick about that on the investments in it Bob I want to come back to you because I want to think at least I'm taking away from COP",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1307,2022-11-20 21:22:09
18694," into climate are probably less than what we expected going into the cop. Well, and just picking up on that on the investments in it, Bob, I want to come back to you because I want to think at least I'm taking away from COP27. You can certainly hear, listen to John Kerry, the president's special envoy on this subject. We're not going to get to it from public money alone. It's going to take a fair amount of private investment as a bond person. Are there bonds that are green bonds or in the climate area that make sense as a business matter? There are. I think for sure, if you're going to finance something, which is what bond investors do, you want something that has something of a green agenda to it. And we're hearing that from our clients. There's more and more money coming into the space. I think Afsania help is on the way for the island economies. The large-scale investors want to commit capital to this space. Well, the inflation reduction act, as it's called, a lot of people object to that title, put a lot of money into the game here on that private side of something. Is it making a difference in the projects that are getting financed? No question. I think the RA is a very powerful act and it's the largest amount of money going in. And I think that will really help us in the U.S. to invest a lot more in climate-related food and ag, in battery storage, in residential and in community-related solar and wind. So that will be a major, major push. And we're seeing, as Bob mentioned, a lot of movement. I agree with him. I think it's just that in COP, where you expected public money to go in, there was a sort of disappointment with that. But the private sector is doing a lot. The young generation is doing a lot. We just need the public sector to jump in when it comes to it outside of the IRA, of course. Bob, last word, are you seeing a difference in your part of the business for the government tax policy when it comes to green bonds? We are. Yeah, absolutely. It's making a real difference, you see it? It is from our perspective. So, yeah, everything we see that, and we didn't touch on the regulation, there's going to be more regulation poking through what qualifies as a green bond or not, and also, you know, to prevent any greenwashing, either in specific bonds or in bond funds. So watch this space. Yeah, okay. We're actually particularly with the new Congress, coming in. Thank you so much. Really great to have both you with us.

18695," This is Wall Street Week. I'm David Weston. It's time to look at what's up next week on Global Wall Street, starting with Annabelle Droolers in Hong Kong. Well, thanks David. This week in Asia we're going to be taking a close look at two big elections. Now in Malaysia, voting took place this Saturday just over a month after parliament was dissolved for a snap poll. And then meanwhile, Taiwan, that holds mid-term this coming weekend. So that's going to be a pulse check on the popularity of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party. As of course, we see geopolitical tensions continue to rise in the region. Eco-wise, the highlight is on central bank meetings in Korea and New Zealand. And we're going to be live from Seoul for the B-OK with expectations there for a half-point hike. Plus, the RBNZ predicted to deliver its 6th straight 50 basis point move. The 2022 World Cup kicks off on Sunday in Qatar. The tournament is being held in the winter for the first time due to the blistering summer temperatures in the region. Thursday sees a re-decision by Sweden's Riksbank. Economist forecast a 75-bias point hike, but surging food prices could tip the bank to raise by even more. We'll also on the same day get an account of the ECB's most recent policy meeting. And last, certainly not least, you energy ministers will be meeting to discuss policy outlook as Europe heads into the winter. A holiday shortened week for the observance of Thanksgiving Day. The main focal point for the week, it will center around the release of the FOMC minutes from that November meeting. A meeting that saw the Fed raise interest rates by 75 basis points for a fourth straight time. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said then that US interest rates would go higher than earlier projected, but several Fed members since have indicated that they may be ready to downshift. A handful of earnings next week to watch, including Zoom video, deer, analogue devices, Best Buy and Nordstrom. Keep an eye on those last two for a read on the strength of the consumer as the traditional kickoff to the holiday shopping season in the US begins on Friday. The main theme to watch there will be the flight to discounted items by cash-strapped consumers that seem willing to spend, but maybe not have the same capacity as they did a year ago. David? Thanks to Annabelle Druller's Danny Burger and Romaine Bostic. Coming up, we saw it happen in the guilt market. Could a crisis come to the markets for US treasuries? And would it come from a lack of liquidity? We're going to ask former vice chair of the Fed, Richard Clarita of PIMCO. That's next on Wall Street Week on Bloomberg. This is a market that over the past few weeks has made it clear it wants to go higher. It got a little spooked by the idea that geopolitical trends are rising. While Tesla's in the like make for good headlines, the reality is that even if every car on the roads today went electric, it wouldn't be enough to curb global emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change.

18696," 71%. Building's across America burn fossil fuels to operate. What we want to do is make that all electric. Instead of burning oil and gas to give us the energy and electricity we need, we want to do 100% clean energy, all electric. We want to turn buildings into Tesla's. Just like a Tesla or an electric vehicle is all electric with no fossil fuels. We want to do that with our buildings. And if we can do it in one building, we can do it in all buildings. And if we do it in all buildings, we'll reduce 30% of US greenhouse gas emissions. On the David Rubenstein Show, here to peer conversations, I uncover the untold stories of the world's most successful leaders. Watch Wednesdays on Bloomberg Television. This is Wall Street Week. I'm David Weston. We spent a good deal of this week trying to figure out where the Fed is heading on rate increases. And part of what we were watching was the Fed's vice chair, Leo Brandard, who gave us at least some hope that we might be getting closer to slowing down. I think it will probably be appropriate soon to move to a slower pace of increases. But I think what's really important to emphasize, we've done a lot, but we have additional work to do, both on raising rates and sustaining restraint to bring inflation down. We welcome now, Ms. Brandard's predecessor, as vice chair, Richard Clarota, now global economic advisor to PIMCO. So Richard, thank you so much for being back with us. Good to have you back with us. So do you agree with your successor there? Do you think we're at least approaching a point where we might slow down the pace of increases? David, I do. The Fed has done a lot this year. In fact, it'll be the fastest pace of rate heights since the early 1980s. I do anticipate that at the December meeting, they'll slow the pace from 75 to 50, the basis points. And I think as we move into 2023, I think they think and I agree that they're close at least to a pause, probably in the first half of next year. They said in the November statement, they've done a lot, and they want to see how the rate heights are impacting the economy. So Richard, you have the advantage of having been in the room and having been in the room relatively recently. Give us a sense of what they're looking at their dashboard, because I'm going to say the economic numbers sometimes point in different directions. On the one hand, we do have some indications like the CPI numbers that may be slowing down a little bit, the inflation. On the other hand, the overall inflation is still pretty high. It is. And you know, the challenge that faces another central banks in the world is that the economy is running hot. And in particular, wages in the economy are growing much faster than consistent with the 2% longer run goal. And so I think that the Fed will be looking at the labor market data. It'll also be looking at inflation expectations. We have downshifted demand growth. There's an imbalance between demand and supply. And this year, demand growth has already downshifted. So that's an important thing to note. We're certainly along the way to where we need to be. But the Fed has more to do, and we need to get inflation back down towards the 2% objective. So everyone seems to agree there's more for the Fed to be done. We just heard Leo Brenner say exactly that. And the question is how much more, and part of the question is what's the terminal rate? I mean, how far up do we go? We had somewhat conflicting indications this week, actually. And the banks basically project these things are coming with very different sorts of answers. What determines that terminal rate? And let me ask you, perhaps more pointedly, some people think the Fed was a little slow getting off the market and getting going. Does the slowness of getting started mean the terminal rate? We'll have to be higher necessarily. David, I don't think so. I think what launching the rate heights in March didn't mean. And I think Chair Powell recognized this pretty early on was that it made sense to get to the destination pretty quickly. And that's why we've had the four successive 75 basis point hikes. My sense right now is the committee believes. Our dipped into our meals涂涂涂涂涂涂涂涂涂涂涂涂涂涂涂涂涂涂涂涂涂涂涂涂涂涂涂涂涂涂涂涂涂涂涂涂涂涂涂涂涂涂涂涂涂涂涂涂涂涂涂涂涂涂",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1310,2022-11-20 21:35:30
18697," Pretty quickly and that's why we've had the four successive 75 basis point Hikes my sense right now is the committee believes and I share the view that my baseline view is that I want to get the funds rate around Percent if the inflation data comes in on the soft side maybe four and three quarters if it comes in on the hot side Maybe five and a quarter or perhaps is President Ballard indicated maybe north of that But I think around five percent in the spring will be at a level where they've done a lot They realize that inflation Response to policy with a lag And I think that that'll be a good place to to take stock So I think that I wouldn't call that necessarily the terminal rate I hope it is if the inflation data doesn't improve than they may have to do more But I think they will cause at around five percent So Richard I think you just put the figure on the thing that at least perplexes me which is it two-place function I mean you've got what the rates are you also have what inflation is and how restrictive that is depends on how far and how fast inflation comes down so going into the spring if you're at five percent How far down do you get need to get inflation before you say okay? That's restrictive enough It's an excellent point because Typically monetary policy op does operate with a lag so the Fed wants to look ahead and indeed For example governor Waller and others have made reference to comparing the policy rate to where Professional forecasters think inflation will be towards the end of of the year And I appreciate that point my own research actually indicates that's a simple thing to do I think the challenge they face David is that quite frankly the Fed's record at forecasting inflation Has not been very good including what I was there Last year and so I think it's going to be a balance between Adjusting policy according to both the forecast and the incoming data Richard is not just the rates that are going on We also have so-called quantitative tightening as you try to run down the balance sheet which had gone so far up Give us your sense of what that is doing right now to financial conditions in the United States Well, David it is tightening conditions again quantitative tightening is is reversing quantitative easing So the Fed's balance sheet is shrinking now. It's been very well telegraphed And so markets certainly understand the pace and the modalities of tightening but it is serving to tighten Financial conditions and that's consistent with what the Fed wants to do in terms of raising rates So Richard that takes us to a subject that I know you've heard a lot about we read about all the time Which is perhaps a problem with liquidity in the treasury market There's more volatility in the treasury market as I understand it but that's inherent in raising rates The question is is there additional volatility because there's not as much liquidity? We hear at least anecdotally that some people are having difficulty By insulating large lots of treasuries Yeah, well, it's true. I went back and looked I had the privilege of 20 years ago of serving as assistant treasury secretary and 01 or no 2 And in those years debt outstanding was about three trillion dollars about 30% of GDP this year It's 23 trillion dollars or a hundred percent of GDP. So quite simply the amount of debt outstanding and the amount of treasury issuance Is vastly larger than it was 10 or 15 years ago and the plumbing of the intermediation system for treasury says not really expanded Can commonly with that and so as a result There is evidence on occasion of ill liquidity in the market certainly in extreme cases as we observed in march of 2020 or September 2019 It becomes even more evident and so I think policy makers at the Fed and the treasury and other agencies are looking at ways in which treasury market functioning can be improved and I think it's certainly something that should be studied and improved And what are possible options if they do conclude there's an issue there one of my supposed to be reversing and going back to quantitative easing That's one way to do it another might be actually to Ameliorating at least some of their restrictions in regulation and repose after the 2008 great financial crisis Which really is i just took a lot of the big banks and we limited their participation in the market Well, it's right and so I think that one of the things David that we did In in the spring of 2020 Is that we did relax Something called the supplementary leverage ratio in the sense that we would not count Bank reserves or treasury holdings against that leverage ratio the idea is we wanted to encourage banks to lend in the pandemic",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1311,2022-11-20 21:39:37
18698," So in the sense that we would not count bank reserves or treasury holdings against that leverage ratio, the idea is we wanted to encourage banks to lend in the pandemic shutdown. And the Fed indicated when it left those exemptions, laps that it would begin, it would review whether or not it made sense to include treasuries and reserves in that leverage calculation. I'm sure that analysis is ongoing, but I think that's certainly something worth serious study. What is the rationale actually for the SLR? I don't not sure I understand it because I would think the treasuries are as close to risk free as possible. You know, the history of this is before the GFC David, we had risk-based standards for banks and so treasuries are not risky, other bonds are more risky. There was a sense broadly in the global community, not just in the US, but through the Basel process in Europe and Asia, central bank and policy makers agreed that it made sense to have a supplementary leveraged ratio that typically would not be binding most of the time, but it could prevent, if you will, financial institutions from gaming and entirely risk-based system. However, you know, we discovered in March of 2020, the banks were in great shape. The banks are part of the solution, not part of the problem, and there can be perverse consequences of having a supplementary leveraged ratio, especially when central banks are doing large amounts of key leak, is the creating reserves which the system has to absorb. So I think it's certainly something that Fed could address, and I think it could make a lot of sense. Rich, thank you so much for being on Wall Street Week. I hope you'll come back often. It's really good to have you, Richard Claret of PIMCO. Coming up, we're going to wrap up the week with our special contributor Larry Summers of Harvard. That's next on Wall Street Week on Bloomberg. So what's the best investment advice you've ever been given by anybody? The compound interest, the compounding of returns, is an incredible miracle of business, finance, and human existence. Everything you learn is additive every day, and if you keep added and don't quit, it's an incredible miracle. And it's not just interest. It was always said about compound interest returns, compound business returns, compound human returns. They're all very additive because you'll learn every day. And if you keep added, it's very, very helpful. In your observation of investors, what do you think is the biggest mistake that average investors make? Selling it the wrong time. And they sell when the prices go down? Yes, or yes. Not keeping, but people have conviction, or if they invest for the right reasons, just keep added. Welcome to the world of decentralized finance. Bloomberg's covering all things crypto, the people, the transactions, and the technology. Bloomberg crypto Tuesdays. This is Wall Street Week. I'm David Weston. Welcome back now. Our special contributor, Larry Summers of Harvard, to wrap up the week for us. Larry, thank you so much for being back with us. A lot of us spent a lot of the week actually trying to figure out where the Fed is headed, particularly where the terminal rate is. And we got conflicting, I think at least, somewhat conflicting answers out of the Fed, including with Mr. Bullard, the Fed president, saying, well, five, five and a quarter, and then put up a chart using the Taylor rule that suggested seven. Where are we?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1312,2022-11-20 21:43:51
18699," answers out of the Fed, including with Mr. Bullard, the Fed president, saying, well, five, five and a quarter, and then put up a chart using the Taylor Rule that suggested seven. Where are we? Look, no one knows. I think it's a mistake to be slavish about Taylor rules. The market thinks the number is going to be about five. I look at things and my sense is there's more room for that to be too low than there is for that to be too high. But it's pretty clear that we've had the big moves on this cycle. And now we're going to be finishing that process off. My view is that there's more risk from stopping prematurely and not really curing inflation and setting the stage up for a re-acceleration of inflation after it comes down. I see that as a bigger risk than going too far, because going too far would mean bringing inflation down below 2%. And that still seems to me like an awfully remote risk starting from where we are. But I think that the Fed has this in the right place when it says that they're going to move up somewhat more and they're going to take stock of the situation and see what the inflation data is saying and seeing what the inflation forecasts are saying when we get to the spring of next fall, spring, winter rather, spring of next year. I have to say that if they hadn't made as many mistakes as they did of excessive optimism about inflation, they'd probably have a little more room than they do to rely on forecasts that hadn't yet proved out that inflation was going to come down. Larry, you and I talk a lot about monetary policy, even fiscal stimulus and things, but geopolitics have also factored increasingly in some of the issues having to do with the economy. This week we had what is potentially, we don't know if it is, an important development in the meeting of President Xi of China and President Biden. What do you make of those discussions and even ongoing discussions because now we have the USTR a madam tie actually meeting with her counterpart. What do you make of the situation with China right now in the United States? Look as Churchill famously said, George J.A. is a lot better than Bang Bang. And so the fact that they had a meaningful conversation that lasted more than three hours, the fact that they both came out of the conversation with the sense that there had been satisfying dialogue, the sense that there are some follow-on steps. I think that's all to the good. What it's really going to mean, what really is going to happen? Is there going to be constructive movement out of those dialogues? I think that's something we're going to have to wait and see. But I'm encouraged by what I saw. And I think it means that President Biden's whole trip has to be regarded as a success. The United States back in the game with respect to climate in Shammel Shake, the meeting with Xi. I don't think this G20 will be long remembered. But at a very vexing moment, there could have been some kind of breakdown. And there certainly was not that. Well, as a minimal thing, I've read some places, people say, at least there is a G20. They came out with a joint communique. And it was fairly tough on Russia, I think it's fair to say. And the reporting behind the scenes are, is that some of the developing countries, like Indonesia and India, help provide that process, which might, I don't want to overread it, suggest that maybe we're taking a half step back toward multilateralism? I think we are. I think that what Russia has done has really shocked the conscience of the world and has affected very, very many countries.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1313,2022-11-20 21:48:11
18700," has really shocked the conscience of the world and has affected very, very many countries. We'll have to see how this plays out. I think we need to remain aware that in the original vote in the UN General Assembly, there were countries with more than half the world's population who abstained onto Russia's side, who declined to join in condemning Russia. So I think we've got a lot of work to do and we in the United States tend to be a bit over optimistic about the extent to which all others see us as in the benign way that we see ourselves. It's such an important point and it takes me back at least to China because it seems to me that sometimes we've been overly optimistic, I mean, for example, going back to the time we admitted into the WTO, we thought China was going to become more like us and then we go over the other extreme being perhaps overly pessimistic about China. I guess my question for you is former Treasury Secretary among other things. How do we play both sides of that? We don't know how we'll end up. How do we keep open the realistic possibly we can really work closely with China but also protect ourselves against the possibility of confrontation? We in the United States probably need to be careful about our evangelizing influence. I don't think it's really for us to tell China how they should organize their entire society. I think it's for us to stand up for some of our fundamental interests in security, in fair economic competition, but to leave it at that point. I think we're going to need to be very careful with respect to our diplomacy on the issue of Taiwan. I think we need to be very careful about giving China the sense that we are trying to change the traditional one-China policy because I think that could risk disastrous conflict. So I think the operative words for us need to be respect for them, respect for the positions and the fundamental interests that they have. And at the same time, absolute insistence on our own. And I would say one other thing, David, I think ultimately we will prevail in this broad context with China, but I think if and when we prevail, it is going to be more than anything else on the strength of our example. And that's why domestic renewal at home, whether the issue is scientific innovation or infrastructure, whether the issue is doing something about opiate deaths or whether the issue is strengthening our education system, whether the issue is building on the greatness of our universities or the greatness of our national parks. And ultimately it's going to be our ability to remain the country that's the envy of the world, the country to which people want to come that is going to determine our success. And if we change our focus from building ourselves up to tearing China down, I think we will be making a very risky and very unfortunate choice. I want to make a very large turn here. I've had the benefit of talking to you about the masters, about basketballs, I want to talk to about Taylor Swift. She's a rather popular pop music star and ticket master because we now know the Department of Justice is investigating possible antitrust problems there because of ticket master which does after I'll have like a 70 percent market share that's been under investigation for some time. I don't know if you know much about Taylor Swift, although I am concerned about you getting tickets, which apparently seems to be difficult. But more broadly, what is it say perhaps about some of the problems with over concentration in the economy? You know, I want to say two things about that, David. The first is that if the government made a website that functioned as badly as ticket master.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1314,2022-11-20 21:52:40
18701," I want to say two things about that, David. The first is that if the government made a website that functioned as badly as ticket masters has here, everybody would be laughing and scorning the government. And so the next time the private sector says that, you know, the public sector can't do anything right, this was a private sector building a website, sort of like they had to build a website for Obamacare, sort of like they have to build websites at the IRS, or like they have to build a build websites for student loan debt relief. And the private sector utterly failed. And that's something that we just have to remember the next time somebody wants to say everything about government is hopeless. Yeah, we are. We have to trust. Yeah, Larry, we're going to have to leave it there. I'm so sorry. We're humble. We have much to be humble about. Larry, thank you so very much. It's Larry. Some of us are a very special contributor here on Wall Street Week. Coming up, a lot of people get hurt when there's a collapse like that of FTX, but who stands to benefit? That's next on Wall Street Week on Bloomberg. MUSIC MUSIC MUSIC MUSIC... Why do the biggest names in business choose Bloomberg? Great question. Great question. Great question. And the best question I get all night. Bloomberg. Top experts. Great questions. And the first Virginia debates Stunde in Dave Hamlin today both Be informed, be prepared, be ahead of the game. Everything you need to get set for the start of U.S. trading, Bloomberg the open with Jonathan Tarot, drilling down in the numbers and preparing you as only Bloomberg can. Weekdays on Bloomberg. Finally, one more thought. If Tom Brady's for it, it's got to be good, right? I'm getting into crypto. With FTX, you win? Despite that endorsement from the greatest quarterback of all time, the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX has brought heartbreak to a lot of people. Wiping out in one fell swoop, what was estimated to be a $32 billion empire. Leaving what its lawyers now say could be as many as a million creditors holding the bag. And by the way, triggering a class action lawsuit against Tom Brady and others paid to tout FTX to the world. The ripple effects of the collapse of FTX and the rest of Sam Bankman-Fried's empire now beginning here as we wait for bankruptcy proceedings. All of which has shaken the confidence of many investors. That's according to Citadel's Ken Griffin. FTX is one of these absolute travesties in the history of financial markets. People are going to lose billions of dollars. And that undermines trust in all financial markets. But as bad as the FTX collapse may be, it's only the latest in a series of major meltdowns we've seen in recent years. Just think back to 2001, when that mythical energy giant Enron hit the skids. Its former CEO Jeff Skilling reflected back on the loss in his later testimony before Congress. I am devastated by an apologetic about what Enron has come to represent. No words can make things right. Too many people have been hurt too much. Or wake up.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1315,2022-11-20 21:57:30
18702," Politetic about what Enron has come to represent. No words can make things right. Too many people have been hurt too much. Or World Com. The telecommunications phenom of the late 90s that followed Enron into bankruptcy in 2002, wiping out a market cap of $186 billion and sending its former CEO Bernie Ebers to prison, despite his trying to seek protection behind the Fifth Amendment. I've been instructed by my counsel not to testify, based on my Fifth Amendment constitutional rights. Or that emblem of the first internet bubble, pets.com with that cute sock puppet mascot, which was an instant market hit when it went public, and just as quickly went flop. What goes up must come down. All of these notorious failures shared a bold vision, a confident leader, and a belief that they'd come up with a better mouse trap, just like Mr. Bankman Fried. And if FTX follows the pattern, it will share one other thing with colossal failures through the years. A lot of lawyers making a lot of money despite all the carnage. When Enron went into bankruptcy, it had assets of over $65 billion. In the ultimate resolution, shareholders were wiped out at a loss of $74 billion. But the lawyers, they walked away with over $1 billion along with the accounts. World Com was three times as big, losing investors in estimated $175 billion. While the lawyers were making over $10 million a month in a proceeding to last it well over a year. Lehman was forced into bankruptcy amid one of the most turbulent periods in our economic history, which culminated in a catastrophic crisis of confidence and a run on the bank. But those were all small potatoes compared with Lehman, a bankruptcy that wiped out between $46 billion and $63 billion according to the New York Fed, and netted the lawyers and other consultants a cool get this $6 billion. So we'll see how much the FTX creditors end up writing off, much less the token holders. As much pain as they're feeling though, you can be sure that there's one group that will come out okay. It's always the lawyers. That does it for this episode of Wall Street Week. I'm David Weston, this is Bloomberg. See you next week.urdance Okay, so you're moving in on me quick. Just trying to be with your fancy hands. I'm going to deal with your knight because it's really bothering me. Ah, my knight. Yeah, he's a troublemaker. Yeah. What did you get up to this weekend? You know, just robot stuff. A lot of chess. I was practicing for you. I know you're pretty good. Ooh, I don't like that. I will take this. Put it over here. Not cool. Not cool. All right, I will, I will concede. I can see. You've got me, Bid. Very good game. Well played. Thank you, sir. Thank you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1316,2022-11-20 22:01:25
18703," Oh, I will concede. I can see. Oh, got rebid. Very good game. Well played. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Very good morning. Welcome to daybreak Australia. I'm Hardy Stradwats in Sydney. I'm Manavale Drollers in Hong Kong. We're counting down to Asia's major market opens. And I'm Kathleen Hayes in Seoul keeping a very close eye on the credit markets. Now look at the top stories this hour. Concerns Beijing may return to stricter virus restrictions after China reports its first COVID related death in nearly six months. And court documents reveal FTX owes its 50 biggest unsafured creditors over $3 billion as crypto exchanges continue to face the fallout from its collapse. And Elon Musk considers firing more Twitter employees as soon as Monday with Bloomberg sources saying this time he's targeting the sales and partnership teams. So it's great to be here in Seoul a very big week for the markets here. Certainly for the Bank of Korea as they get ready for a meeting where they were expected probably to do a 50 basis point hike. But now people are saying the odds of risen for the 25 basis point hike after all the turmoil in the credit markets over the last month. Certainly the economy is maybe looking ahead to some tough times. We're watching very closely for exports today. The 20 day exports are going to be out just a couple of hours. But inflation's getting a little better. The ones have been a little bit stronger. Maybe the 25 basis point has increasing odds at this point. Increasing odds. And I have to say they were increasing odds of a collapse as we got into the final hours of COP27 though. But negotiators managed to walk back from the brink of collapse to seal this historic deal that will help developing nations have funds to deal with the devastating impact of climate change. There was approved without a single opposing voice. And this is a deal for loss and damage that seen as a historic victory. But at the same time it's come at a cost. Negotiators didn't manage to secure commitments for more ambitious cuts on Greek house gas emissions. We knew that the EU, the UK, some small island nations wanted stronger commitments on cutting greenhouse gas emissions. That failed attempts to agree to peak global emissions by 2025 or the phase down of all unabated fossil fuels also failed as well. So to a lot of negotiators and a lot of countries, this came as a mixed victory that came with a lot of unfortunate compromises. Let's get you to Bell, who's in Hong Kong to set up how markets are really looking to start the week. Thanks, Heidi, Kathleen, you're of course this is a market that's really just been dominated by views on when the Fed will start to pivot. And we saw that sentiment down turn last week with Fed officials really keeping up their views that they will need to stay higher for longer. But you can see here this is the last close for the Friday session in the US. And the people or traders really shrugging off these concerns also being reflected of course this morning, what we see for Aussie futures and the New Zealand is fractionally in the green here. The moves in the 10 year yield, yes, we did see that move higher for the 10 year yield, but still options traders at least betting that the Fed will start to pivot and they're repiling into positions that will pay off when the Fed does change the pace or the magnitude of its rate heights. Let's change on though for a look at what's happening in commodities because here we're actually seeing a bit of a different perception forming we saw a weekly drop for oil also for copper here. So concerns around recession that would be induced by the Fed, other central banks hiking their rates and also what is happening in China given that we do see cova cases they're still continuing to rise a really big test for officials and how",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1317,2022-11-20 22:05:33
18704," and also what is happening in China, given that we do see COVID cases, they're still continuing to rise a really big test for officials and how they plan to deal with those, also what we're seeing in the offshore you aren't trading this morning, Kathleen. Well, Annabelle, that's such a big story. You just mentioned China's first COVID-related death in nearly six months has sparked concern that Beijing could see a return of heightened restrictions as it's something markets have been watching, oh, so closely, managing editor for Asia Global Business. Emma Bryan joins us now. So, Emma, how could this affect the way the government moves ahead? Everyone was all geared up for this gradual move to changing the rules, moving in the direction of being much more loose with these. Now it's going to happen. Yeah, I mean, I think sort of in the wake of all that exuberance, around the easing that we saw two, five days ago, a little bit has been lost that China still does have the most stringent COVID curbs left in the world. You still do have very strict quarantine on entry. They are still doing lockdowns. They're just trying to make these curbs more targeted. And that is what you are seeing on the ground, somewhat you're not seeing the subsidy one. You're not seeing the subsidy-wide, very broad sweeping lockdowns. Like we saw, for example, in Chengdu just before the party Congress. But you are still seeing districts shut down, individual schools told to study from home. That sort of thing on the ground. And the concern is that we'll move even further away from that more targeted approach as the case has started to get higher, because you still do have this mandate for Chinese officials. About bringing outbreaks under control, at least as far as the rhetoric goes, that they are still targeting zero transmission in the community. So it is that canundrum, that conflict, that could lead to sort of harsher restrictions on the ground in Beijing. Because there is a real risk, Emma, of the rolling back of these targeted measures, if we start seeing more deaths. Yeah, I mean, fatalities are the ultimate test for China, because there has been so much rhetorical hay being made by the Communist Party, comparing China's death toll just over 5,000 to the entire length of the pandemic, versus more than a million say for the US. So so much has been made of that by the party, by Xi Jinping, to start to see a very strong way of death will really be a big test. Now, the man who died over the weekend, this was the first death since the Shanghai lockdown. He was an older man, an 87-year-old dying in Beijing. And China does have a very key vulnerability when it comes to its elder population, because you don't have the same levels of vaccination among those older people that you do in the rest of the population, you do in other parts of the world, only 66% of those aged over 80 are fully vaccinated, compared to a similar rate of 90% for a similar group, sorry, in the US. So they are clearly vulnerable when it comes to older people. So it will be a real test over the next couple of days, whether they can tolerate this higher level of cases, whether that is a shift or whether they do start to basically put broad sweeping lockdowns in place, peace by peace. Well, Vague's Emma O'Brien there with the latest the COVID situation in China. In the meantime, though, the markets building a quite a bullish consensus for Chinese shares. That's really been emerging quite obviously as a theme on Wall Street lately. Newfound optimism around Xi Jinping's policy pivots. Let's bring our chief rates across one for Asia. Gafu Reynolds and Gafu was actually just looking through one of the notes from our guests today saying that the return of the Chinese consumer is a big story for them going into next year. They're expecting China to see the biggest earnings boost out of any of the regions. Does it feel like we're getting ahead of ourselves or is the optimism kind of warranted? Well, I mean the thing China for all its s-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1318,2022-11-20 22:09:54
18705," Does it feel like we're getting ahead of ourselves or is the optimism kind of wanted or warranted? Well, I mean the thing, China for all its size, for all that it means for the world, it's still very much in that emerging market category. So you have a lot of capacity for rapid shifts in policy and perceptions, you're part of the reason why shares jumped so far, just recently because they've fallen such a very long way down. And there are also certain pretty concerning antecedents. You know, we had this coming out of COVID China was supposed to lead the world, but then it turned out they had a different approach in a lot of ways, not just to COVID, but also the common prosperity, all of that meant. So they're definitely cheap Chinese shares. The question is, do they, and they're cheap for a reason, and other's reasons going to go away. One particular potential reason for caution is, this is an extremely rapid jump that's gone up more than 20% in just like sort of 11, 12 trading days. We had a similar jump back in April, that didn't end very well. In fact, we've had a handful of similar surges over the last decade or more, none of which ended well. If you want to find a bull market turnaround like this that ended up being sustained, you've got to go back to 2008. So that's a long, long way back. Then again, people have been talking about this year, is feeling like 2008. The question is, is this the turnaround for China, or is this another false story? We don't go far. I want to bring up, even though I'm sitting here in Seoul, Korea, and I'm very much focused on the BOK this week and the fact that, you know, global aggressive tightening, our Bloomberg survey shows, is one of the biggest risks that they're looking at, right? Now for their economy, crypto still lingers, right? The FTX fallout. Is that something the market starting to put behind us, or is it still front and center? Well, it's still getting an enormous amount of attention, partly because it's such a fascinating story. And partly, of course, because part of that fascination is that there are a lot of people who have a lot of money at risk there that they're worried they're not going to get back. So, it's on the radar. It helps perhaps at the margin to underscore that there's plenty of reasons for caution about getting you're too bullish, that we're in a different regime now, to the regime we were in 2020-2021, when crypto just, it seemed that the sky was nowhere near the limit for where it was going to go. So, there's that sobering aspect to it, but in general, perhaps it even encourages investors to go, okay, we need to look for places where there's some sort of fundamentals that we can, you know, base our investment decisions on, rather than just going, well, crypto is always going to go up at some stage, so, you know, pile into that, or some of the other riskier bets. So, you know, we're talking just now about Chinese shares. If you're talking also about the Korean one or about Korean shares, those are very risky investments as well, but you've got some guidelines. You've got a much greater history that tells you that, in fact, historically, we're at levels that rarely sustain this cheap, so maybe FTX is encouraging people if they are going to take risks to be a bit more careful in doing so. Well, if that doesn't encourage the car, I don't know what will. That's a good way to start the week. Chief Reads correspondent for Asia Garfield Reynolds. Now, let's move on to some other big stories. Like Twitter's offices that to reopen Monday after a mass exodus of workers forced a shutdown last week, sources also say EOLM Esk is considering firing more employees this time targeting the sales and partnership side of the business. So Bloomberg Sukhin has been following the she joins us now. So the staffing issue, what's the latest and what are people inside who are still inside the firm, I said, say leaking out about this one?

Why our next guest believes that the Fed is set to slow its pace of rate hikes Boca Capillapartner's CIO Kim Forest shares her investment strategy shortly.

18707," expected to keep their loan prime rates unchanged, Kathleen. Well, looking at past financial crises, haunting South Korean policy makers is they rush to support the local credit market. Stress points include a weakening bond, rising rates in inflation, a slowdown in exports. Plenty of data coming out of Seoul this week, including, importantly, 20-day trade numbers, consumer confidence, PPI, and business sentiment surveys. And that's your week ahead. Our next guest says the U.S. bond market seems to think the Fed is set to slow the pace of its rate hikes. And she's in that camp too. So let's bring in Kim Forest founder and CIO, Boca Capital Partners. It's a big debate at this point. Certainly a big one for the markets, Kim, that inflation has slowed its pace of increase a bit. But, Fed officials have made it very clear, they need to see continued sustainable declines and that they are in no way ready to pull back from moving the key rate up to at least 5%. Where does that leave your investment strategy? Sure. Well, I don't think it really matters for how we put money to work, because we think you should be looking longer term than the next 12 months anyhow. We look three to five years ahead, but we know the Fed is not thinking quite that far ahead, although we did get some recent numbers in the middle of November that kind of indicates softening inflation here. And if you really, and I hate to get all math nerdy here on you, but if you look at how the CPI is constructed, it uses lagging housing data. And housing here has fallen off a cliff, and we're expecting it to be negative year over year at some point, just because of the high rate of mortgages. So looking at that, I think the Fed might have at least some fuel to at least lower it to 50 basis points this time for mid 75 basis points. Sure. So, how do you expect the bond market to react to all this? Because markets are forward looking, I totally get it. You want to move to where you think things are going to be, not where they are now. But the Fed has also made it clear that once inflation stabilizes, it will start slowing down hikes, but it may be a long time before the Fed cuts rates, certainly maybe for the rest of this year. What does that mean for bond yields? And that, of course, it has a lot to do with what equities are doing. Absolutely. Well, and whenever I first got into the equity game, I kind of pupu'd what happened in the bond market, and I think that is very, very wrong. Every investor has to keep an eye on the bond market. And with the bond market told us, since the sometime in, I think, the end of November, I'm sorry, the end of October, when the 10 year was well above 4%, I think it topped out at 4.2, it's fallen precipitously to about 3.8, which that's a huge move. And it did so on a couple of days, whenever data was released, they kind of showed a softening inflationary environment. So I think the bond market is a little bit smarter about what the Fed needs to do and what it's going to do. So it's been telling us that the Fed probably won't be able to get its rates up to 5%, nor will it need to. Kim, brutal year for retail stocks. Do you think Black Friday is going to change that? I think businesses, and this is public companies and private companies, are much smarter this year than they had been in years past, and are really parsing out the savings, the things that get you in the door, and then they have a good, if not great, selection. So I'm looking forward to a good retail year this year, although I think the retailers understand it's not, will buy it at any price, not anymore. So they have a good selection of well priced items for shoppers this year.

Let's suppose you win a proxy fight and or you just get invited on to the board. Go to your first board meeting and you're the first one who's saying you can fix this company and all the others on the board of directors are saying well we're doing pretty well. How do you get received when you start saying here's what I wanted you to do? Well first of all we don't bring that to the board. Our time is spent with the CEO of the chairman, the CFO and share our plans with them outside the board. We try never to solve an issue in the board. It's always best done in the day before the week before outside that. We wouldn't be there if they really were doing well. So it's really hard for them to straight face and tell us we're doing well. We presented with a plan. A quick check of latest business flash headlines, the financial times reporting that Chinese authorities are helping Foxconn re-staff its iPhone assembly lines.

18709," While Tesla's in the like make for good headlines, the reality is that even if every car on the roads today won electric, it wouldn't be enough to curb global emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions from transportation account for about 29% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. So what about the other 71%? Buildings across America burn fossil fuels to operate. What we want to do is make that all electric. Instead of burning oil and gas to give us the energy and electricity we need, we want to do 100% clean energy, all electric. We want to turn buildings into Tesla's. Just like a Tesla or an electric vehicle is all electric with no fossil fuels, we want to do that with our buildings. If we can do it in one building, we can do it in all buildings. If we do it in all buildings, we'll reduce 30% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.

The latest data have not reduced my sense of what's sufficiently restrictive may mean or my resolve to bring inflation down. Boston Fed President Susan Collins on the Central Bank's policy direction. Let's stick with Outlook for rate hikes now and bring in Annabelle for morning calls. Annabelle, how are investors interpreting all the hawkish Fed speak? Kathleen, it has been pretty interesting because so far, of course, we've basically seen investors sort of shrugging it off. Standard chart is one of those saying that any expectation that traders may have for an easing of this aggressive rate rate hikes could be a little bit premature in markets. That's because they say that the Fed and also investors out there will need to see more evidence that inflation is easing before we start to see any sort of cooling in terms of the pace and the size of rate hikes in the months ahead. So the question is really how far the Fed will pivot once it does start to see CPI coming back under control. Standard chart actually has a view out there that's a little bit lower than the consensus, which we do know is around 5% around the end of the second quarter. They say that we'll see the peak at 4.75% instead. Now the risk of this forecast of your change on is that standard chart says that the Fed not only reduces the size of its rate hikes, but also extends the length of the rate hiking cycle to ensure that inflation is moving down a little bit more substantially toward its target. So in terms of what that means for it, bond investors out there will standard chart says that the two-year yield at this level, not an attractive entry point, the five-year yield though is. And that's because it does give a longer call expiry option for traders out there. And also that the 10 and the 30-year yield will hide its standard chart and also saying we've already seen the peak there back in October. Bell, what about the outlook when it comes to emerging market bonds? Yeah, this has also been saying really basically the return really of the high yield party to emerging markets, but investors are now buying bonds as some of the world's poorest nations at the fastest pace that we've seen since June 22, 2005. So we're seeing yields really pulling back there as well. So JP Morgan data out there showing that people really taking advantage of the debt that's in the likes of Pakistan, Ghana, Ukraine, they're what's really...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1323,2022-11-20 22:34:20
18710," The JP Morgan data out there showing that people really taking advantage of the debt that's in the likes of Pakistan, Ghana, Ukraine, they're what's really leading this high yield rally. But basically, state street global markets saying that this is really down to this prospect of slower fed rate hikes. And so they're saying that high yield emerging market bonds are now looking better than the ones in the investment great space. Heidi. I'm a managing director, Chris Alina Gorgeva says trade barriers against China and other countries could cost the global economy $1.4 trillion. Speaking to us at the apex on Madgoggeva says nations need to avoid divisions as they face the fallout of multiple crises. In a difficult time for the world economy, this part performs better but to sustain growth would require overcoming fragmentation that is a big threat to the world today. Three summits, one message, we must work together because we are in a world that is going from one shock to another. And if we add on top of it the fragmentation in the world economy, it would be throwing gasoline on a fire. Nobody benefits from it. How concerned are you though the prolonged isolation of China's economy might even be more prolonged and there will be potentially, we've seen it in the property sector, we've seen defaults, we've seen job losses. Are these headwinds insurmountable if this goes on too long? Yes, they are significant and what I'm hoping to see is some reversal in policies about towards China and globally. The world is going to lose 1.5% of GDP just because of divisions that may split us into two trading blocks. This is 1.4 trillion dollars, just imagine what we can do with these kinds of money. For Asia, the loss is much more significant because Asia is so integrated in global value chains, it could be 3% or more. Let's talk about inflation. Your managing director, Gita Gopinath, told us at the Bloomberg New Economy Forum in Singapore that there have been false dawns on inflation possibly easing before. Are there particular economies in the world where you worried that they might reverse tackling inflation too soon? I'm not worried about the United States, let me start from that because US economy is the most important in that regard. The fact is going to stay the course for as long as it takes to bring inflation down to the target. In Europe, the situation is more difficult. Why? Because there, the impact of the war in Ukraine is significant. Half of the European Union at least would be in recession next year. That would put pressure on the European Central Bank to ease conditions. I was relieved to hear my predecessor, Christine Lagarde, saying we are not going to do that. But the politicians in Europe may be more vocal in trying to get relief before it is time to do so. You have to go, but is there anything else you wanted to say? Well, you have us on camera right now. Have you on camera? The very best message I have heard in this three summits was President Jokovy, this war must end. The single most damaging factor for the world economy is the war. And if we want to return to growth, the sooner the war ends, the better. And that's I am, I am a managing director, Kristalina Gorgieva speaking to Bloomberg's Stephen Angle. Now let's get the first word news with Bonnie Quinn, Bonnie.

18711," I'm F. Managing Director, Kristalina Gorgiavas, speaking to Bloomberg's Stephen Angle. Now, let's get the first word news with Vani Quinn. KELOLYN, thank you. China's first COVID-related death in almost six months has sparked concerns that Beijing could see a return of heightened restrictions. An 87-year-old man died in Beijing on Saturday after his condition worsened. It's the first documented death from COVID since May 26, when officials in Shanghai reported one fatality. Nationwide, more than 23,000 new cases were logged on Saturday. Papua New Guinea's Prime Minister says Chinese President Xi Jinping has never expressed interest in a military base in the Pacific nation. Concerned has been growing among the U.S. and its allies about Beijing's security interests in the region. Speaking exclusively to Bloomberg at the APEC summit in Bangkok, James Morapese said the two men had only discussed quote what they could do for business. Let me be open and can't wait for China to have never expressed clearly the interest for military base or presence of the sort of nature in PNZ. Notting about military, nothing about aid and rent. Turkey has carried out airstrikes against U.S.-backed, Kurdish militant groups in Iraq and northern Syria. The Defense Ministry says the raids were to eliminate what it called a terrorist threat and come after a deadly bombing that targeted civilians in Istanbul. The offensive could shore up flagging domestic support for Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan ahead of elections next year. Global news, 24 hours a day on air and on Bloomberg, a quick take powered by more than 2700 journalists and more than 120 countries. Malaysia and political leaders have until 2pm on Monday to inform the king of their choice of Prime Minister. That's after Saturday's vote produced the country's first ever hung parliament. Malaysian opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim says he has the numbers to form government, but it may be at the cost of having a forge a deal with a long-term nemesis. A very own Julia Sally joins us live from Kuala Lumpur and Jules. What's the latest? What are we expecting by this afternoon? Yeah, absolutely. Heidi, it does look like Malaysia is set for its first ever hung parliament. So a lot of deal-making happening over the weekend. And as you say, opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim, who at 75 is really trying to clinch his hopes of becoming Malaysia's Prime Minister, doing a lot of deal-making and potentially having to make a deal with the BN, the long-ruling coalition, which of course was ousted from power in 2018 and that shocked defeat before coming back in following the, of course, collapse of the government that upsets them. But opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim's Pakistan Harapan party, they have 83, 82, excuse me, out of the 222 seats needed to form government. And then you have the former Prime Minister Mohir and Yassin, whose pro-Malay PN, has 73 of the 222 seats needed. Now, both parties need to form an alliance, so they need 112 to get a majority. So a lot of deal-making here happening here and it is going to have to be with the former ruling coalition BN and its caretaker Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Jakob. But of course, it's come under pressure for calling this election early. He was trying to capitalize on some of the weakness amongst the opposition and it now looks like that he and his party could lose this election. It's going to come down to a lot of the states as well, so deal-making happening in the Borneo state of Sarawak, for example, the likes of Sabah as well, as they try to form this majority with 112 seats. We saw about 73 percent of registered voters come out on Saturday, the 21 million voters coming out, but of course a lot of uncertainty here. And the other thing to mention is that Malaysia's longest-running Prime Minister Mahatya Muhammad, who also was trying to go for his seat and to potentially become Prime Minister, he actually lost his land car we see it, so that is ending his political career. So when it comes to voters, what's their dominant concern now? Yeah, absolutely, Kathleen, it's all been about the economy. You look at the cost of living in Malaysia rising sharply like it is around the rest of the world. inflation almost doubling since the start of the year. We have seen some strong economic growth, 14.2 percent GDP in the last quarter, but you look at the average cost of living the 1500 ring at per month. That's about $329 US dollars per month is the national minimum salary. So you have a lot of people really struggling to put food on the",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1325,2022-11-20 22:43:01
18712," cost of living the 1500 ring at per month. That's about $329 US dollars per month is the national minimum salary. So you have a lot of people really struggling to put food on the table when Malaysia's own central bank said back in 2018 that couples should have 4,500 ring at a month, 6,500 if they have children. So we've got these inflationary pressures, the rising cost of chicken, for example, Malaysia's favorite meat. And then you can see the uncertainty in the political environment really reflected in the stock market to the KLCI done 24% from its April 2018 peak, Kathleen Heidi. That's Juliet Salih live in Kuala Lumpur, we're hearing more from her throughout the shows today. Up next we discuss the precedent setting climate deals or reached at COP27 with Lazard asset management. This is Bloomberg. You will shed light on dark matter. You will make aging optional because when you subscribe to Bloomberg, you won't just get news. You'll get insight into limitless possibilities. Before you change the world, Bloomberg. The week's long COP27 summit has finally landed a deal to set up a fund that pays poorer countries for the harm caused by climate change. Let's bring Nikita Singhal, who is Ziko head of sustainable investment and ASG at Lazard asset management. Nikita, great to have you with us. So this is a hard one, victory and of course a deal that's really three decades in the making. It did come at the compromise of a lot of other ambitions that didn't make it across the line. Give us your thoughts as to where this takes up in the fight against climate change. Sure. Some are calling this the biggest climate win since the Paris Accord, which was in 2015. This is mostly because of the new funding agreement on loss and damages, which is a substantial win for especially for developing countries, the emerging markets that are going to face increasingly the physical risks of climate change. And it is also really a sign of solidarity that countries around the world are coming together to try to mitigate and adapt to climate change that is really a global issue, not a regional one. But there are still many unknowns. We don't know where the money is going to come from, what the trigger points are going to be for these payments and really to even be enough. So I would like to point out actually to four really seminal events heading into COP27 that could possibly at be as important if not more important than the event itself. The Inflation Reduction Act, arguably the largest piece of climate policy coming out of the United States. The EU's energy policy response to the Russia-Ukraine war, Australia's landmark climate deal, and then the election of President Lula in Brazil that could significantly impact the fate of the Amazon rainforest. Nghita, when it comes to this funding agreement, I know you've just said that the devil is in the details, right? But do you expect it to make a meaningful impact when it comes to?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1326,2022-11-20 22:47:21
18713," Nogita, when it comes to this funding agreement, I know you've just said that the devil is in the details, right? But do you expect it to make a meaningful impact when it comes to investment on funding for climate fighting technologies? I am a little skeptical. There are a lot of the finer points of this deal that still need to be worked out. There is no clear expectation on a face down of coal or any other fossil fuels. In fact, there are references to low emissions in addition to renewable energy. And some are seeing this as a loophole. As investors, what we are most focused on is trying to estimate what the policy response is going to be to this climate agreement in different parts of the world. Some sort of inevitable policy response to the physical risks of climate change that we're seeing. And how does that then translate into risks and opportunities for us across industries, across regions, across asset classes? Well, it seems that one of those sticking points, and of course this getting funding for low-income countries is very important. But what about the Ukraine war and how it has made people feel very closely the push-pull between transitioning away from fossil fuels? But trying to do it at a time when it's so scarce, you can't really do that without leaving people vulnerable to being cold during the winter. You've articulated it better than I would, Kathleen. The Ukraine Russia conflict has revealed challenges of an energy transition. Fossil fuels are pervasive in our lives, everything from the toothbrush, the plastic and the toothbrush that we have to the agricultural equipment that grows the grains that we eat. And energy security has come to the top of the agenda as almost as important as the energy transition. So the EU has had to shift tax. They've had to amp up the expected investments in renewable energy. And with that, we'll come expected investments in grid infrastructure. But on the other hand, they've also had to recognize the important role that transition fuels are going to play in our economies. And most importantly, start to change their stance on different energy technologies, including nuclear. As investors, I would say, especially at Lazard, what we are most focused on is how does this change our expectation about the pace of the energy transition? And perhaps more importantly, how does it change the relative opportunities within the energy technology space? So it is an exciting time for fundamental active investors as there's a lot to unpack here. So what specifically do you see as investment opportunities? We remain quite excited for 2023 and beyond. In the clean energy space, there is an opportunity we believe to find investments in market leading technologies, whether this is in the energy efficiency space, electric vehicles, renewable energy, battery storage, etc. Especially being able to find attractive entry points amidst the market volatility against this backdrop of macroeconomic pressures. I will kind of go back to my point that as fundamental active investors like us at Lazard, what we're most excited about is the opportunity amidst this volatility to discover and price opportunities. And we often talk about the risks of climate change, but as investors, it's surely creating disruptions across industries, and that creates a lot of opportunities as well. Well, many thanks to Nikita Sengal, co-head of Sustainable Investment in ESG at Lazard asset management looking at COP27 and the investment possibilities. So let's stay with the push to go green now. Qatar and FIFA have pledged the 2022 World Cup, I should say. We'll be carbon neutral. But environmentalists are raising alarms as the events kicks off. Say, the event has been greenwashed. It'll add millions of megatonnes of CO2 to the atmosphere. In 2010, FIFA announced that Qatar would host the 2022 World Cup. In its bid, the country promised to make it a carbon neutral tournament. But as the matches approach, environmentalists are claiming that Qatar has greenwashed the World Cup, and that the event will put millions of megatons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. So that claim is mostly a PR play. Essentially, there is no way that a mega event of that size can be carbon neutral. FIFA.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1327,2022-11-20 22:51:42
18714," I'm excited into the atmosphere. That claim is mostly a PR play. Essentially, there is no way that a mega event of that size can be carbon neutral. FIFA can do better, and should do better. And my focus would be on encouraging to do that for the next World Cup. The UN defines carbon neutrality or achieving net zero carbon emissions as balancing a measured amount of carbon released with an equal amount offset. First step is to measure your emissions. And so that's what FIFA has done for the World Cup. We looked into that calculation, and we think that this is quite significant on the estimated. So there's two big challenges with any carbon neutrality claim at an event of this size. The first one is travel. And the second part of this is construction. 75% of the carbon footprint of all sports stadium over their entire lifetime is locked in on day one from the materials that built from. It's not about operating costs. It's about concrete steel. Qatar has invested billions of dollars in infrastructure for the tournament, including building seven new stadiums. Organizers estimate that the World Cup will emit 3.6 megatons of carbon dioxide. The construction of the stadium is the most problematic elements because it's the element that we think was most massively underestimated. From that factor, we think the total footprint would be five million tons. International flights in and out of Doha will account for the majority of emissions. However, organizers argue that this World Cup will be more energy efficient than others, since fans won't have to fly to different venues and can instead just take public transit. The sticking point is always the flights. Most Olympics and World Cups, it accounts to more than 85% of total emissions. Balancing carbon emissions with offsets is key to carbon neutrality. So far, Qatar has purchased less than 350,000 carbon offset credits of the 3.6 million needed in their estimation. The Supreme Committee says that it has already secured a minimum of 1.5 million credits from the Global Carbon Council, and that further details will be forthcoming. So far, greenwashing issues are not keeping fans from rooting for their teams on the pitch. An estimated 1.7 million people will be in attendance with over 3 million tickets sold. But with a warmer future ahead, effects on fans will soon be felt. Sport is the most enormous opportunity to tackle the climate crisis, because we can engage football fans and make them advance of the environment through their favourite sport.

18715," It will be much welcome news when it comes to a lot of these Australian and commerce. We're talking everything from wine to seafood to meat exporters that have really borne the brunt of the deteriorating relationship but to bring the true. Take a look at this chart when we're talking about alternative markets, right? We know that Australia has been trying to diversify its markets for everything from soft commodities to metals to services away from China, including the likes of India, but really you take a look at these numbers. China is still the top destination for Australian goods exports. When it comes to that top number is 38%. So the crux of the issue is that there is no simple replacement for that demographic. Well, and thank goodness for iron ore. If you are an Australian exporter, but I've got to tell you one of the ones that we toughest for me is the wine. I love the Australian Shardinese. I love the Italian Reds. So, this should be the Australian Reds. So I think that's not only a problem for China and Australia, but certainly for the rest of the world. Big deal for me. Well, so that's it for Daybreak Australia. We're going to continue looking at the markets. Continue looking at the week ahead. Daybreak Asia is next. We're going to continue looking at the market. We're going to continue looking at the market. So now you've been at JP Morgan for about 25 years. Yes. So now you run one of the most important parts of JP Morgan, which is, I say, the asset and wealth management business. What actually is wealth management and how is that different than asset management? Great question. The two are often used interchangeably, but they have distinctions. The asset management business is where we manage money on behalf of individuals, institutions, sovereign wealth funds, pension funds. We manage them in mutual funds. We manage them in ETFs. We manage them in single stock, single bonds, hedge funds, private equity, and the like. And that is the heart of the fiduciary business that we run here at JP Morgan. So the wealth management is that plus understanding someone's entire balance sheet. So for the individuals where we manage money, we also help them with their mortgage. We help them with alone that they might need. We help them with their basic credit card. And so wealth management is trying to help someone with their entire life, both their assets and their liabilities, their planning, their gifting, the legacy that they want to leave for their families. The 529 plans they need to prepare to get their kids to go through college. And it's a great insight into people's, you know, entire journey. What do you think of when you think of a battery?

As we drive to an increasingly renewable power driven grid, we also need to be able to store energy and release it later to cover those periods of weather intermittencies that are driving this new grid that we're in. It's a multi-trillion dollar opportunity, and it's imperative that we figure out the solution here. How we store energy on a massive scale is in many ways the central challenge of the fight to stop climate change. Welcome to the world of decentralized finance. I'm going to take a look right here at regulation. We are seeing digital currencies under some pressure. Bloomberg's covering all things crypto, the people. I want to have some of my money outside of the solder. The transactions. It all comes down to the details here. And the technology. How does that affect disruptors like you? What happens to everything that you're investing is when the last Bitcoin is mine. Bloomberg crypto Tuesdays. You're watching daybreak Asia coming to you live from Seoul, Sydney and Hong Kong. We're counting down to the market opens in Japan and South Korea. Australia has just come online. The top store is our concerns. Beijing may return to stricter virus restrictions after China reports its first COVID-related death in almost six months. Asia markets that for a cautious open investors continue to focus on the outlook for interest rates. Atlanta's Rafael Boss dig says that he favours slowing the pace of Fed hikes. Also, a head court documents reveal FDX owes its 50 biggest unsecured creditors over $3 billion. And I'm Juliette Sali in Kuala Lumpur, where the clock is ticking from Malaysia's political parties to come up with a viable government after Saturday's vote delivered the country's first ever Hong Parliament. Well, it's the start of another trading week here in Asia. And so far Australia just coming online, and actually hide this morning. So not only following that direction that we had in the US session Friday, but also does appear that investors that now at least do appear to be sort of shrugging off this hawkish commentary that we've had coming through. Even the likes of the Boston Fed president Susan Collins saying she's not ruling out a 75 basis point move in December. In terms of what else are keeping an eye on this morning. So got yields moving, actually high here in the bond space, also tracking those moves that we had in treasuries. And then the dollar here as well, fractionally stronger this morning, the failing mix in the G 10 space today. Let's change it on and take a look at as well. The broader outlook has got New Zealand already into trading this morning, and we're in the green still US features also coming online to the upside this morning oil. It is fractionally higher at the start here, but you've got to put it in context because we're coming off one of the worst weeks for oil that was seen this year, both brain crude and WTI down around 10%. There's two factors here at play, Heidi. Not only is there concerns around recession being induced by aggressive fed fed tightening, also from other central banks, but also what is happening in China and the demand outlook there hasn't fully come back online, given that there's still a lot of concern around COVID zero in the country. Yeah, and at the same time, Bell, we're hearing a bullish consensus really for Chinese equities building on more street and you found optimism around Xi Jinping's policy pervets. Let's get some more from Garfield Reynolds, who joins me here in Sydney. He's of course our Chief Rates correspondent for Asia. Of course, the possibility of a return to stricter curbs is always the worry, but there is this momentum building behind the bullish China trade now. Yeah, there is. And although there are some concerns, we've had a very strong spike higher in Chinese shares as recently as April that turned around. Perhaps it's a little bit of a stronger this time is different precisely because of the apparent shift when it comes to COVID zero and the idea that they might push through even in the face of what was a big surge.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1330,2022-11-20 23:04:43
18717," Because of the apparent shift when it comes to COVID-0 and the idea that they might push through even in the face of what was a big surge in case rates, they were still talking about being a little bit less doctrinaire about the way they pursue things. So that makes this unfortunate case of the man's death, the first one I've had nearly six months. That makes it a very pivotal point for China's economy and for people who want to invest in it, will China still stick with the idea that it needs to adopt a somewhat different approach when it comes to COVID because of the economic damage that goes along with trying to be also sure that you're pursuing the right health outcomes as well, which is in Australia and elsewhere for example, this still quite has strong case rate here, but there's no real talk of going back to restrictions because the decision has been made to move on. So will China stick with its pivot on the COVID front? That's a key question for the people who've been piling in in the hopes that this 20-something percent move in 11 days is going to turn out to be a solid and sustainable basis for an equity case going forward. Is there more of a sustainable basis when you take a look at a better outlook for emerging markets? Obviously, we're still watching the Fed's pathway as a determinant for that. Well, I mean, the Fed and other central banks and how they respond, we've got the Bank of Korea coming up later this week. That's a very key question. I mean, the thing that's been an overwhelming relief point for emerging markets has been the way the dollar has come off. Your dollar strength has notably sagged. Even as other markets have gone up and down with the tail of the tape on this Fed president says, I'd be OK with 50. This president says, I can't take 75 off the table. Bullard says whether it's 50 or 75, I reckon we should go above five and maybe in his slides, 7 percent or something could be there if inflation doesn't slow down. So there are a lot of your concerns for bond investors, equity investors in developed markets and elsewhere, but the constant has been a waning in the dollar strength that had done so much damage to emerging markets. So I think in the emerging market space, that's going to be the key. Keep your focus on the US dollar. If it stays calm, then carry on. That's good advice in many ways. So FTX, crypto, the fallout to markets behind investors or still looming in ahead. Well, I think still looming on the margins. And again, in particular, there are certain parts of the markets that are already a bit under pressure. You think of the tech space, which has got its own concerns and crypto has sort of wound up with that. So it's a concern there, but becoming a bit less of one, the crashes happened. There are some second-order effects here. We were looking for some other potential bankruptcies in the space. But one thing, in fact, that it's maybe concentrated minds on is the fact that crypto just matters a lot less. The whole crypto market was worth two trillion or so or more, one stage. And now it's worth significantly less than a trillion. So when you compare that to the market capitalization, so global equity markets, global bond markets, crypto is becoming a smaller and smaller part of that world. And therefore, the ups and downs of that space can be set to one side mostly. Our chief rates correspondent for Asia Garfield Reynolds. And we're going to get some more on China. That first COVID-related debt, then, almost six months, is the concern that Beijing could see a return of heightened restrictions. I'm editing editor for Asia Global Business and Rebying Junction now. So this is the first debt since the Shanghai lockdown. We've just started to get some, some lots of optimism of these targeted lockdown measures. Could we see a backtracking now? Yeah, I mean, fatalities were always going to be very key to determining how China moves forward, whether they do sort of dial back a little bit of the looser sort of more targeted approaches, you say, or whether they keep pushing forward. And it's a little bit of a maze.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1331,2022-11-20 23:09:01
18718," or whether they keep pushing forward. And it's a little bit of a make or break period right now because we're just closely watching to see what they do. The cases have been rising quite sharply and they have been met with still very stringent restrictions though much more targeted than before. What people are fearful of is that the uptick in cases coupled with more deaths if we start to see them, particularly among the elderly population, will lead officials to panic and revert to those more broad brush, city-wide lockdowns, mass testings that were so disruptive before. The vaccination levels remain the puzzle piece that we keep watching up for. And I know the data over the past few weeks potentially have been a little bit more optimistic. Yeah, I mean, I think that vaccination has been coming up. Boosters are still very low. People over the age of 80 still very, very low compared to other parts of the world. Around 70% for those over 80 have had only two shots, whereas that figure for the US is over 90%. So there are still very fundamental things China needs to address, including its hospital system before it can reopen in a way like other parts of the world. If you think about Australia, for example, it only started to reopen when key parts of the country had more than 90% of the population vaccinated. We know we're near that in China. And so while we are seeing a lot of optimism in markets toward these more targeted curbs, this is not the big bang reopening that people might have hoped for. When makes Emma a brine there with the latest on China and COVID-0, let's get you to Vonnequin in New York with the first-word headlines, Vonne. Heidi, thank you. Malaysian political leaders have until 2 p.m. Monday to inform the king of their choice of prime minister. That's after Saturday's vote produced the country's first ever hung parliament. Opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim says he has the numbers to form government, despite falling short of a simple majority. But former prime minister Mu Yudin Yasin also says his coalition can take power with the support of two regional parties. The IMF says the rise of trade barriers against China and other countries over the past year could cost the global economy $1.4 trillion. Fund-managing director Kristina Giorjefas, says the potential loss for Asia could be more than 3% of GDP because the region is more integrated into the global value chain. She wants Asian countries to work together to overcome fragmentation. The world is going to lose 1.5% of GDP just because of divisions that may split us into two trading blocks. This is $1.4 trillion. For Asia, the loss is much more significant because Asia is so integrated in global value chains. It could be 3% or more. The world's biggest single sporting event, soccer's World Cup has begun in Qatar with a lavish opening ceremony. The Gulf states have been under intense scrutiny leading up to the tournament over the treatment of migrant workers who build seven new stadiums, as well as concerns about human rights and its criminalization of homosexuality. And it wasn't the start the hosts who were hoping for on the pitch either, beaten 2-0 by Ecuador in the opening match.

18719,"quéciğim noche I've always been a person who's just been attracted to hair. I like to sit and think and theorize how I can manifest these visions that I have for braiding and how I can take something that may seem like it's a line drawing in my mind and apply that to someone's scalp. We are the only culture that has hair that grows out of our head the way that it does. Anyone from the African diaspora is born with this amazingly curly hair that can be shaped into a variety of different ways of expression. I want black people to love themselves for how they naturally appear and also to appreciate the cultural practice is such as braiding that our ancestors have practiced for centuries. A multi-trillion dollar industry, there's a lot of ground to cover. Come on, these guys absolutely crushed! We'll show you what's happening in ETFs like no one else. You're watching Daybreak Asia. I'm Kathleen Hayes coming to you from Seoul. Now let's look at the week ahead. The Fed's focus on Wednesday when we'll get minutes from its November meeting and more detail on decision to hike rates by 75 basis points for the fourth straight time. On Thursday, the bank created to raise its key rate with other policy decisions coming from New Zealand and Pakistan. As Europe marches into the winter, EU energy ministers meet in Brussels on Thursday to lay out a detailed plan for a gas price cap. On Friday, the strength of the U.S. consumer will be tested again with the Black Friday sales, the likes of Walmart, Target and Costco appear set for a solid holiday season, as October non-cash sales track ahead of 2021. And later Monday, China's big banks are expected to keep their loan prime rates unchanged. And that's your week ahead. Well, Kathleen, our next guest says a big story of 2023 will be the return of the Chinese consume driving strong earnings. Growth joining us now is David Wong, who's the senior investment strategy to St. Police at Alliance Bernstein, David. Great to have you with us. And I like a vision for 2023. I think we're all hopeful that it will be the year when we see China reopening the Chinese consumer returning and again, playing that kind of cyclical effect for global growth. We've just had the first death from COVID-19 in about six months since the Shanghai lockdown. Does that worry you that we're going to see a return to stricter curbs? I think China's been extraordinarily careful when it comes to COVID and how it's managed in the context of a very large population. But I would say that the officials seem to understand that there is a certain political as well as economic calculus at work here to think about the drag on a continued basis on the economy if they don't reopen. And I think they've done everything that they can to reopen as safely as possible. We've certainly seen them finally say to people that are under-vaccinated to get their shots. And I think everything that we're seeing suggests that China is preparing for hands.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1333,2022-11-20 23:17:46
18720," needed to get their shots. And I think everything that we're seeing suggests that China's preparing for handling a significant increase in the number of cases. And I think all of that is why we feel fairly high conviction that next year we'll be the year for the Chinese consumers return. And we've seen in every market that has experienced a reopening that there has been significant strength attached to it. What China has that other markets have not is that it does not have an inflation problem. And so as that process occurs, I think we can actually go at it with a greater degree of confidence. And certainly the by-China cause is getting stronger out of Wall Street, JP Morgan, even more and Stanley tends to be more cautious, joining that chorus. But I do wonder when it's about aligning your call with the timing of the reopening, how hard is it to get that rise? Well, I think one cannot be exact in timing. But what I've always found in a couple of decades of investing in China deploying capital there is that when you have valuation extremes and also sentiment extremes, that is actually often the time to invest. And while we have seen a rather significant bounce, we need to bear in mind the even more significant fall that we've seen preceding that over the last three or four months in. Well, David, an interesting point you make is you think the old growth style approach towards investing in China, the growth style, right, has been discredited. This is a time when growth has greatly slowed down. Is it because you think growth is going to speed up so much? Not so much. I mean, while we certainly think that there is a tactical bounce for Chinese equities really across the board, what we've seen is that the old approach to China of just saying, oh, well, it's got high GDP growth, that should lead to a better revenue and earnings growth, that hasn't really worked out for people, especially for those that wanted to buy more expensive growth style stocks on high valuations. And what we think China reminds us of today is Korea 20 years ago when it was slowing down from being an Asian tiger to an OECD level of growth. And when you combine that with relatively lower return on equities for the market overall, we think means that we need to approach the market with a value style instead. And instead of it being value versus growth in China, value versus policy alignment. All right. So are there any sectors, any industries where you would advise people who do want to invest in China to put their focus? Well, we do like a variety of different idiosyncratic opportunities. We don't think it's as easy as just saying, oh, what the worst is past, let's pile into the Chinese property market. But we do think that consumer-oriented parts of the economy are probably likely to have much better fundamentals in 2023. And when we look at the longer term, when I spoke earlier of policy alignment, we really think that green and net zero aligned strategies of investing in the Chinese equity market make a lot of sense. And that's because China certainly is aiming to be a positive actor on the green global stage. But they also obviously have their own energy security, very much foremost in their minds. And I think investing alongside the Chinese government in Detroit暴利ól",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1334,2022-11-20 23:22:12
18721," You know, very much foremost in their minds. And I think investing alongside the Chinese government in ensuring that it becomes that the Saudi Arabia of wind and solar, if you will, as well as electric vehicles is a very exciting long-term growth prospect. David, great to have you with us. And I hope your bullish views on China come true. David Wong, senior investment strategist for equities at Alliance Bernstein. And Kathleen sticking with China. At the moment, things are not looking like it's trending, necessarily in the right direction, right, China's. Shijia Drong is to conduct mass COVID tests in some areas. There's about a 12 million population in this northern city that we're talking about here. The recommendation is for all residents to stay at home. They'll be holding in-person classes lockdown universities as well. And this really, as we've only fairly recently seen a loosening of pandemic restrictions for Shijia Drong, really being seen as a test for the broader reopening in China. We had policymakers really, you know, looking up potentially, shifting away from some of the less targeted measures this comes. As, of course, we see so much investor enthusiasm for this potential reopening, maybe even to clear the way for that big rebound in Chinese equities, Kathleen. Maybe it's like a lot of things in life, Heidi. You make two steps forward, one back. Let's hope that's what's happening more steps forward coming from China, coming up on the show. Twitter clears the way for Donald Trump's return as Elon Musk is said to consider more staff cuts and update just ahead. This is Bloomberg. So let's go inside the boardroom. Let's suppose you win a proxy fight and or you just get invited on to the board. You go to your first board meeting and you're the person who's saying you can fix this company and all of the others on the board of directors are saying, well, we're doing pretty well. How do you get received when you start saying, here's what I wanted you to do? Well, first of all, we don't bring that to the board. Our time is spent with the CEO of the chairman, the CFO and share our plans with them outside the board. We try never to solve an issue in a board. Okay, it's always best done the day before the week before outside the afternoon. We wouldn't be there if they really were doing well. So it's really hard for them to straight face and tell us we're doing well. And we presented with a plan. Well, Twitter offices are set to be open on Monday after a mass exodus of workers forced to shut down last week. Sources also say Elon Musk is considering firing more employees this time targeting the sales and partnership side of the business. Bloomberg, Sue Kenen joins us now. So let's start off with the latest staffing issues and all of the broader concerns that this is raising. Yes, well, your sources inside Twitter say that take over Twitter, and there is concern with so many thousands of workers leaving that the platform is increasingly exposed.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1335,2022-11-20 23:26:19
18722," And Twitter say that takeover turmoil continues. And there is concern with so many thousands of workers leaving that the platform is increasingly exposed to hacks and other potential problems. We're also hearing from people close to the matter. Elon Musk now considering firing more employees this time to layoffs, as mentioned. Could target the sales and partnership side of the business as of late last week. Friday, Twitter offices had to close when far more employees and technical rose than inspected resigned. An exodus, if you will, that was not expected. Musk had issued an ultimatum for workers to sign on for a more hardcore version of their job up to 80 hours a week or to leave and many chose to leave. So sources of total bloombergers now concern the app is increasingly exposed to bugs that can't be fixed. And then big events like the World Cup could overload and already stressed Twitter system. Kathleen? So Sue, meanwhile, Elon Musk says that Donald Trump's account is being reinstated. I guess it pays to declare your run for the presidency. Yes, just last week the president did declare, but you remember that Elon Musk had said he wants this to be a platform for free speech. So it wasn't just Trump but a couple of others that he is now restoring. He held a 24-hour poll. 52 percent to 48 percent was the vote that came in to allow former president Trump to return. The people have spoken Trump tweeted out and more than 15 million users are cast votes. So, Jimmy Recall, Trump was permanently banned from Twitter in 2021 due to the risk of violence following the insurrection at the Capitol. Earlier this week he said he was going to run for president and many would say it's not a done deal that he returns to the platform. Trump was quoted saying he's not sure there's a reason for it and that quote, maybe it'll make it, maybe it won't. There is increasing speculation that Twitter is facing insurmountable odds. The NAACP, by the way, issued an urgent advisory to many companies to suspend their advertising on the platform if Trump does initiate tweets once again. So that would put further pressure financially on the platform. Back to you. All right, Sukhin and with the latest on Elon Musk and Twitter. Well, now we're going to count down to the start of trade in Seoul. So some stories we're watching today. Let me show you. In Korea, trade data for the first 20 days in November said to be released in around 40 minutes, finance minister Jukin Kho will hold a press briefing later today. The mail, business newspaper says Chuse been meeting every Sunday since mid-October with the OKK governor, Rijong Yang. And the bank of Korea released this monthly data for residents for in exchange deposits. But in order to come on daybreak Asia, this is Bloomberg. The reality is that even if every car on the roads today won electric, it wouldn't be enough to curb global emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions from transportation account for about 29% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. So what about the other 71% building across America burned fossil fuels to operate. What we want to do is make that all electric. Instead of burning oil and gas to give us the energy and electricity we need, we want to do 100% clean energy.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1336,2022-11-20 23:30:51
18723," is make that all electric. Instead of burning oil and gas to give us the energy and electricity we need, we wanna do a hundred percent clean energy, all electric. We want to turn buildings into Teslas. Just like a Tesla or an electric vehicle is all electric with no fossil fuels, we wanna do that with our buildings. If we can do it in one building, we can do it in all buildings, and if we do it in all buildings, we'll reduce 30% of US greenhouse gas emissions. This is Wilberg Daybreak, but Lake Wilberg. Welcome to Daybreak Australia. It's Karen on the close. Welcome to Wilberg, crypto. We're Malaysian opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim, and ex-premium, we're using Yassin, a competing to form the next government after snap elections led to a hung parliament. Party leaders have until Monday afternoon to inform the nation's monarch, who will be in charge. It's cross over to Colin Lumpur, who is virtually a solid standing by with our next guest, Jules. Hi, I'd be yes indeed. It is looking like Malaysia's first ever hung parliament. So a lot at stake here. Let's get to our guest, James Chin, joining me live from Kuala Lumpur, University of Tasmania, professor of Asian Studies. Great to have you with us, James. I mean, you thought there would be a clear winner by Saturday. So obviously surprising here. What do you think kind of happened? And what is next as we start to see both the parties try to form an alliance here? So let's start off with the polling done before the elections. So most people thought that Pakatan Harapan was way ahead. So that's the reason why most people thought that Pakatan will form the government on Saturday night. The second big player was supposed to be the old incumbent government, Barissa National, but everything turned out to be wrong. So basically what happened on Saturday night was that you had three big blocks, and out of three big blocks, two of them were roughly the same numbers. So that's the reason why we have this thing called Han Parliament. They were not able to put together the numbers required the former government. So we have both Anwar Ibrahim and the pro Malay PN, both saying they think they can get to that 112 seat majority. You were telling the earlier you think it's more likely PN will get there. Just tell us what this means if we are going to see a pro-Islamic government. Right. So my argument is that the sort of government that will be formed probably this afternoon will be exactly the same players that were in the last government, which is the PN, I'm known, Barissa National, and GPS, a sort of a smaller coalition from the state of Surrawa. So what does it mean? I think what it means is that this time around, this coalition, the core of this coalition that's going to rule Malaysia, will be Pati Islam, which is the Islamic Party here. At the moment, they call us about 49 seats in Parliament, and they might even wing up to the 50 seats. So whoever forms a government, the core of this new government will be an Islamic Party. A lot of the new younger voters, and there are about 6 million of them after the voting age, was lowered, really want the leaders to be focusing on stability, on the economy, moving away from racial-based politics. Do you think that that is likely? Do we ever see that in Malaysia? Well, we don't have real statistics here, but sort of the early numbers showed that the young people did not really come out to vote, but those who did come out to vote, interestingly, now voted for the Islamic Party. So I think what happened was that a lot of people misread the situation with the young people, that made the assumption that the young people are more interested in things like red butter issues, career opportunities, economic opportunities, below and behold, they were actually interested in more conservative religion. Okay, so what do we see if your projection is right, and we do see a PN come to power? What does that mean for foreign inflows when you're looking at the stock market? About 24% from its 2018 peak, and you've got the ring at this 24-year low. So basically what we have is, well, at the very first start, we will have a new Prime Minister, who's an old Prime Minister. So it's very likely that Mouyeh, the New Year's Sing, who used to be the Prime Minister of 2020, will come back as a Prime Minister. So it's good for him because he will break Mahatats record, he'll come back as a Prime Minister of second time. Now, in terms of economic policy, I don't expect any major changes to the economic policies in a short term. A lot will depend on which ministers are pointed to the key economic policy. Unfortunately, the former Finance Minister lost in the recent...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1337,2022-11-20 23:35:17

But let's change on now and take a look at the broader markets today because we're half an hour into the session or just over for Australia here in West still, just fractually in the green today in New Zealand also trading to the upside. It is following what we're seeing in the US future so they have now turned negative. We did have that close higher in the Friday session. Really what investors are trying to weigh up is just how serious federal officials are about taming inflation. There has been a chorus of very hawkish voices out there including the Boston President Susan Collins saying she's not ruling out a 75 basis point move for in September or rather December. And then also the outlook for the offshore Uaans as well, given what's happening with China and this code case is that it's spiking their Heidi. Let's get to Bonnie Quinn now with the first word headlines, Bonnie. Well just on that theme, Heidi, China's first COVID related death in almost six months as sparked concern Beijing could see a return of heightened restrictions. An 87-year-old man died on Saturday after his condition worsened. It's the first documented death from COVID since May 26th, when officials in Shanghai reported one fatality. Nationwide more than 23,000 new cases were logged on Saturday. Time and negotiators in the Egypt have struck a deal that resets the relationship between rich and poor countries. Approved without a single opposing voice, the agreement creates a fund that helps developing nations face the devastation of climate change. Although the deal is an historic victory, negotiators fail to secure commitments for more ambitious cuts on greenhouse gas emissions. The UN's Atomic Agency says powerful blasts have shaken the area around Ukraine's Apparicia nuclear power plant. This includes more than a dozen on Sunday morning. The IAEA says some buildings and systems were damaged, but none critically. Ukraine's nuclear regulators has Russian forces struck the facility, but Russia's army issued a statement blaming Ukraine for the shelling. Turkey has carried out airstrikes against U.S.-backed Kurdish militant groups in Iraq and Northern Syria. The defense ministry says the raids were to eliminate what it called a terrorist threat, and come after a deadly bombing that targeted civilians in Istanbul. The offensive could shore up flagging domestic support for Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan ahead of elections next year.

Well, probably you're getting used Prime Minister, says Chinese President Xi Jinping has never expressed interest in a military base in his nation. Beijing has been looking to beef up its security interests in the Pacific, alarming the U.S. and its regional allies, including Australia. James Mara-Pasberg exclusively with our Steve Rangel. Let me be open and kind of China for once has never, never expressed clearly the interest for military base or presence of the sort of nature in PNG. He had me clearly also. Yesterday's conversation with President Xi Jinping, for instance, all conversations in the good 20 minutes we spoke just on what they could do for business for us. Nothing about the military. Nothing about military. Nothing about aid and grant, you know, made reference to past support. But under my watch I'm saying aid and grant is okay, but I am more about you buying my produces. You bring your investors in. So, China state cleared cleared of those conversations. Are you concerned, though, by the politicization of this region and that the competing superpowers are perhaps seeing you as in between competing visions for this part of the world? Em Konsen and the Pacific is Konsen, but I think finding the mutual round for respect upon each other is important and I was happy at APEC, as well as APEC at G20, that the global big leaders met and they talked. And, you know, it's a first step in the right direction, talking and understanding. We may not change either. It's at as well, we overnight, but there's a place for tolerance and there's a place for securing a better future for the entire children of our planet, if not now for a future going forward. What is the risk of...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1339,2022-11-20 23:43:48
18726," There's a place for securing a better future for the entire children of our planet, if not now for the future going forward. What is the risk of possible militarization of this part of the world? I don't think there will be any other nations coming into the Pacific, for instance, for military presence. It is up to our leaders in the region to call for military presence, if need be, but our specific wireless-based international health guide and a PNG in the context has no desire, and neither has China proposed for instance. They have not. To have a military race in PNG. Is there any dialogue on a security pact with China? Not at the stage. No conversation. Papua Nagini Prime Minister James Merripe. Up next on the show, asymmetric advisors tell us why SoftBang's chip subsidiary, ARM, is highly unlikely to be worth what it's been touted details ahead. The US's jobs numbers are released. Bloomberg brings you crucial data at terminal speed and instant expert analysis. Nobody covers jobs day like Bloomberg. It's time for Japan ahead on daybreak Asia. Prime Minister Femio Kishida says the international community must continue to work together to pressure Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. The NICA reporting that Kishida has sacked internal affairs Minister Minoru Terada and is planning to announce his replacement later on Monday. Asahi reporting that Japan post bank is considering joining forces with Japan industrial partners and its bid to acquire Toshiba with an investment of around $356 million. Let's look at SoftBang. It's visioned fund posted more than $7 billion on tech investments. It's said down to anticipate writing down its $100 million investment in FTX. Let's bring in Amir Anzavarde. He's senior market strategist to asymmetrics advisors. Amir, it's great to have you joining us today. The FTX Fiasco has hit many investors. What does it mean here for SoftBang? It's a drop in the ocean for SoftBang. $100 million is really compared to the losses that SoftBang has been seeing. FTX losses are very small in comparison. So not really, I mean, in the whole scope of the losses that they're making is really not a big deal. So what is determining your view on SoftBang mainly right now? Well, I mean, you know, the market first start, right? So, you know, the IPO market has been shut down for a while. I mean, obviously, you know, things could turn around fairly quickly.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1340,2022-11-20 23:48:16
18727," Well, I mean, you know, the market for a start, right? So, you know, the IPO market's been shut down for a while. I mean, obviously, you know, things could turn around fairly quickly. If the market does turn around, but obviously, you know, they have a huge amount of money invested in listed and unlisted stocks. We've seen some big write downs in unlisted ones in the last six months. The values have been determined by the next round of financing, which have shown that, you know, the values have gone down quite substantially in number of big investments. And as far as elisted ones are concerned, you know, obviously, we can see what's been going on there. So, yeah, I mean, it's the market conditions more than anything else. But obviously, soft banks investment picks have not been, I've been far from Stella. And, yeah, so, you know, we're in it. You know, they're in a fairly tough situation, I think, in regards to some of the loans have been secured as a collateral in their stakes in the investments that, for example, Alibaba. So, yeah, I mean, Alibaba's share price of recently bounced back. It's not a good news, but generally, the market does head down again. They're nothing soft bankers in a bit of trouble. That feels like a little bit of an understatement. And Marseille seems to be in quite a bit of trouble, particularly given what we've seen with his personal stakes in these investments, right? Yeah, you see what you don't read in the financial times, the $4 billion of money that was borrowed from the corporation, from soft bank itself. But what you don't actually, what they didn't address is the fact that his stake in soft bank, a big chunk of his stake in soft bank has been put up as collateral to banks, which is borrowed against, and that money is going to vision fund one. Again, I mean, it was the revelation that he's lost $4 billion of his own money. It was not really a big news, although, you know, the fact that he hasn't paid the money back to soft bank group is something that we didn't know, but he has a huge amount of loans, outstanding versus the banks. And he used his stake in soft bank, he's now nearly 30% stake in soft bank. He used the big chunk of those stakes as collateral against those loans. And that wasn't really addressed in the FD. Do we know where the bottom is, particularly with regard to these unlisted devaluations, that we are not seeing for someone? Do we know where the bottom is? Do we know where the bottom of the market is? No, we don't know. I would love to know. But no, the answer is no. We don't know when the private equity businesses are going to find a bottom in these investments. It's not just soft bank to be fair to them. It's a lot of other private equity firms have seen big losses this year. So I keep telling people that, you know, the view on soft bank is very much dependent on the market view itself. But, you know, one thing we can say for sure is that, you know, there have been very aggressively buying back shares of their own stock, which we think has been, it's kind of valley destructive in a sense, because what they're doing is they're selling the best assets, say, say, Alibaba and other stocks, and then using that money to buy back shares and kind of concentrating the risk by doing so. So, yeah, I mean, you know, it just seemed very unusual at the time when they...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1341,2022-11-20 23:52:26
18728," Well, by doing so. So yeah, I mean, you know, it just seemed very unusual at the time when they're facing capital constraints. They've been aggressively buying back and completing their buyback programs much earlier than their promise to keep the share price from falling. And that's a major concern, I think. All right. Thank you so much. I'm here on Rosade. See, senior market strategist at asymmetric advisors. Stay tuned to Bloomberg TV for more key interviews on Japan ahead. That's every Monday at 840 AM in Tokyo 640 PM Sunday, if you're watching in New York, Heidi. Kathleen, we'll continue to monitor the COVID-19 in zero situation in China. We're now hearing that China's grand jule province will lock down their Bayou in district for five days. They're really announcing that this is to curb, of course, a spread of COVID-19. It comes as we saw the country's first COVID death in months. And that's really raised more fears that this more targeted, potentially relaxed approach that have been pushed forward by policymakers and heralded as markets as potentially the first step towards an eventual reopening back if we continue to see more deaths. This is the first COVID-related death in almost six months. We could see potentially that return of heightened restrictions. And of course, just to remind you, Guangzhou is where we've seen some of those violent protests, tussling, protesters tussling with COVID workers in full PPE and just an indication that that dissatisfaction with COVID-0 is building in China. More to come here on daybreak Asia. This is Bloomberg. No one covers the world like Bloomberg. My team thinks 2023, we avoid a recession. I'm a little more skeptical about that. China and the US both do not want to see nuclear force in the European continent. The regulators here in the Bahá'uá is ongoing with their investigation into aptiats.

Now, a quick check of latest business flash headlines starting with Japan Post Bank, reportedly considering joining forces with Japan industrial partners in its bid to acquire Toshiba. The Asahi newspaper reports that the investment may amount to more than $350 million. Bloomberg earlier reported that JIP consortium was in talks with about 20 potential co-investors. An examiner has found bankrupt crypto-linear Celsius network was lax in its crypto custody across two services, making it difficult to determine how users will be reimbursed. The examiner's report found Celsius launched custody without adequate controls. But withhold program also made no effort to segregate assets. Italy's economic development ministry says it's not working on an alternative plan for a single fixed line network, pushing back on media reports of a change in approach. Local media reported telecom atalia would sell a controlling state to Italy's state lender, while hanging on to a holding to sell later.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1342,2022-11-20 23:56:44
